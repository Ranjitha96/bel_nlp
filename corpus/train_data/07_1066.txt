http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  Traditionally  agreements to negotiate in   good faith   were viewed as unenforceable due to want of certainty or lack of consideration  eg Carr

Australia   th ed    at       Furthermore  in Aiton Australia  Einstein J at   said that       It appears to be common sense that as an obligation to act in  good faith  may  in principle  be legally recognised as an implied or imputed obligation  there is no reason why it should be struck down as uncertain in cases where there is an express contractual term       First  what is  good faith  or the content of a good faith obligation will inevitably turn on the facts of each case  It has been described as a contextual standard  In Australia  this has been the starting point for an assessment of good faith in a number of cases  The contextual standard has been variously described  In Aiton Australia   Einstein J said at        The good faith concept acquires substance from the particular events that take place and to which it is applied  As such  the standard must be fact intensive and is best determined on a case by case basis using the broad discretion of the trial court   Although as noted above  the boundaries of good faith evade precise definition  there appears to be at least some consensus on the limits of any such duty  In particular  a duty of good faith      is not fiduciary in nature        does not require a party to subordinate its own interests  let alone act selflessly  and      does not require a party to restrict decisions and actions  reasonably taken  which are designed to promote the legitimate interests of a party and which are not otherwise in breach of an express contractual term   See Justice Finn  Good Faith and Fair Dealing  Australia

International v Airservices Australia     FCR   and Renard Constructions  ME  Pty Ltd v Minister for Public Works     NSWLR      As a result  some academics and judges have resorted to ascertaining the scope of   good faith   by focusing on the negative or the exclusions   what constitutes   bad faith    This has been described as the   excluder   definition on the basis that the good faith requirement cannot actually be satisfied in positive terms  See Summers RS   Good Faith  in General Contract Law and the Sales Provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code      Va L Rev   Renard Constructions at   Burger King at   and Pacific Brands Sport   Leisure Pty Ltd v Underworks Pty Ltd   FCA   at          In Australia  part of the impetus for the recognition of a implied duty to act in good faith has been the desirability and practice of courts in controlling reliance on general rescission clauses so as to prevent their use   for improper and extraneous purposes   see Godfrey

explicit promise to negotiate in good faith is sufficiently certain to be contractually binding  eg Coal Cliff Collieries Pty Ltd v Sijehama Pty Ltd     NSWLR   Australis Media Holdings Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Ltd     NSWLR   Aiton Australia at   and see Carter JW  Peden E  Tolhurst GJ  Contract Law in Australia   th ed    at       In Coal Cliff at   Kirby P said that          so long as the promise is clear and part of an undoubted agreement between the parties  the court will not adopt a general principle that relief for the breach of such promise must be withheld   The first question is the proper construction of cl     of the HofA  Clause     of the HofA provides that       e ach party will conduct all such negotiations in good faith to ensure that the terms set out in these  HofA  are given full effect   It is a composite clause  It appears to involve two concepts     negotiations in good faith     but directed at a particular end    to ensure that the terms set out in these  HofA  are given full effect    The phrase   negotiations in good faith   is not a defined term  That does not necessarily make the requirement uncertain  In Coal Cliff at   Kirby P acknowledged that       i n a small number of cases  by reference to a readily ascertainable external standard  the court may be able to add flesh to a provision which is otherwise unacceptably vague or uncertain or apparently illusory  see eg  Powell v Jones   SASR   at   Sweet and Maxwell Ltd v Universal News Services Ltd     QB   cf Meehan v Jones   HCA         CLR   at   Jillcy Film Enterprises   Inc v Home Box Office Inc   F Supp   at      and  Ridgeway Coal Co Inc v FMC Corporation   F Supp     at      An examination of just two cases illustrates the difficulties in identifying any standard or principle against which the certainty of such a clause is to be considered  In Coal Cliff   the Court found that an obligation to proceed   in good faith to consult together upon the formulation of a more comprehensive and detailed joint venture agreement   was uncertain  see Kirby P at   with whom Waddell A JA agreed  Kirby P  while clearly recognising that some contracts to negotiate in good faith will be enforceable at law  at   considered that the contract in question was outside the   small number of cases         This was not a case where an external arbitrator was nominated to resolve outstanding differences  There were many such differences at the time of the heads of agreement and a number remain even three years later when negotiations were finally broken off  A court would be extremely ill equipped to fill the remaining blank spaces and to resolve questions which three years of painful negotiation between the solicitors for the parties had failed to remove  A court could not  in this case  appeal to objective standards or to its own experience   as it might in filling a blank space in a lease of domestic premises or a contract less complex and more familiar than one for a major mining development  At stake are commercial decisions involving adjustments which would contemplate binding the parties for years and deciding issues that lie well beyond the expertise of a court  How mining executives  attending to the interests of their corporation and its shareholders might act in negotiating such a complex transaction is quite unknowable        Emphasis added         Clearly  his Honour was concerned about the incompleteness of the contract and the extent to which the court  if it was to give effect to the clause  would be required to undertake the inappropriate exercise of determining terms yet to be negotiated in order to make the contract workable   I consider that cl     of the HofA is uncertain  Clause     of the HofA suffers from the same problems referred to by Kirby J in Coal Cliff   As I have said  what does the phrase    e ach party will conduct all such negotiations in good faith to ensure that the terms set out in these  HofA  are given full effect   mean  How and against what standard is the Court to fill in the gaps  I consider the issue of the content of any such duty in further detail in section  iii  below  For present purposes  it is sufficient to note that I do not consider that it was open to BreakFree to seek to terminate the HofA on the grounds that Latitude had breached cl     of the HofA  The term was uncertain consideredCommonwealth v Verwayen   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  As will be apparent  I have characterised the events of and from   August   as the mutual giving up of the capacity to terminate for the failure to satisfy the Deposits Condition Precedent  The parties variously described the events as  waiver   new contract  and variation  BreakFree submitted that there was no waiver in fact or at law  I have dealt with the facts  The legal submission does not assist BreakFree  It is true that in Commonwealth v Verwayen   HCA         CLR   at   Brennan J defined waiver as   a unilateral release or abandonment of a right  where the right is abandoned once and for all  However  his honour went on to note  at   that   it is a characteristic of a right susceptible of waiver that it is introduced solely for the benefit of one party    In the present case and notwithstanding the fact that BreakFree was contractually bound to proceed with the development in the absence of the HofA  the express terms of cl       make it abundantly clear that it was not a right susceptible of waiver it was not introduced solely for the benefit of one party  To suggest otherwise is to ignore the express words not only of cl       but also cl     of the HofA   There is also arguably a further difficulty with BreakFree s contention that it was entitled to rely upon the Deposits Condition Precedent  It is by no means clear that BreakFree would have been entitled to resile from any contract  whether it be a  new contract  the HofA or the long form contract  for non fulfilment by it of its contractual obligations in circumstances where the innocent party had no recourse against it  The termination letter on   August   demonstrated an intention by BreakFree to use its own contractual breach to avoid completion of the HofA or any  new  or long form contract in existence at that time   BreakFree sought to rely on other conduct of Latitude as a basis for termination  That conduct was variously described as a breach of duty by Latitude to negotiate in good faith to give full effect to the HofA  the alleged failure by Latitude to provide the Second Bank Guarantee  the Third Bank Guarantee and the Fixed and Floating Charge and the conduct of Latitude after   August    I will deal with each purported basis in turn consideredCon Kallergis Pty Ltd  trading as Sunlighting Australasia  v Calshonie Pty Ltd  formerly CW Norris Pty Ltd      BCL   Conversely  in Con Kallergis Pty Ltd  trading as Sunlighting Australasia  v Calshonie Pty Ltd  formerly CW Norris Pty Ltd      BCL   in an unanimous decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal  Hayne J at   said       Some of the writing in this area seeks to suggest that there can be only one answer to the general question whether an agreement to negotiate is enforceable  The discussion by the members of the courts who decided Coal Cliff and Trawl Industries   as well as the discussion by Giles  J  of the problems he had to consider in Hooper Bailie and in Elizabeth Bay show that the question may be more complex than the simple statement of it may suggest and that the answer to the problem may vary according to the precise terms of the agreement  They suggest that it is only when all of the circumstances are known that it can be seen whether the obligations of the parties  described as  to negotiate  can be identified with certainty   The Court then went on to conclude that the agreement in question  expressed in the following terms  was certain       an arrangement between A and B that B would pay A a price for work done by A which was a price  to be negotiated  by B with C    The argument before  the Court  assumed that  B  was obliged by its agreement with  A  to conduct the negotiations with  C  in good faith  or honestly and reasonably    The agreement was considered  certain  because   B and C must negotiate  B because it is bound to A to do so and C because it is bound to B to do so  and there is a process for resolving any disagreement between B   C    at    Hayne J distinguished the agreement in Con Kallergis from that considered by the House of Lords in Walford  The latter was found to be uncertain because either party could break off negotiations at any time and for any reason appliedCouncil of the City of Sydney v Goldspar Australia Pty Ltd     ALR   It is sufficient to note that intermediate courts have repeatedly been willing to hold that such a duty exists  However  as noted earlier I was referred to only one decision where the existence of such a duty  express or implied  was held to have been breached  Pacific Brands Sport   Leisure Pty Ltd v Underworks Pty Ltd   FCA   at     a decision which Gyles J subsequently described as   adventurous   Council of the City of Sydney v Goldspar Australia Pty Ltd     ALR   at    Two things should be noted about the decision at first instance  First  the breach of such a duty was not determinative   Pacific Brands Sport   Leisure Pty Ltd v Underworks Pty Ltd   FCA   at     and the decision was the subject of appeal  Finn and Sundberg JJ at   considered that it was unnecessary or inappropriate to deal with the issue given their conclusions on other issues and  further  went on to say  at   that       Given both the multiple assumptions required to be made if one was to consider  the subject of breach of an implied duty of good faith  and the potentially contentious nature character of it in any event  we do not consider it is appropriate or helpful to enter upon the matter at this point in this appeal         See also Emmett J at       More recently Gyles J in Goldspar at   said       The best way for a single judge to travel through this thicket is to concentrate upon the particular contractual provision in question  in the particular contract  in the particular circumstances of the case   Specific conduct has also been identified by various courts as constituting   bad faith   or a lack of   good faith   including      acting arbitrarily  capriciously  unreasonably or recklessly  e g  see

favoured   reasonableness   as one of the requirements of good faith  Finkelstein J in Garry Rogers Motors stated that  provided the party exercising the power acts reasonably in all the circumstances  the duty to act fairly and in good faith will ordinarily be satisfied    at    However  several Australian academics have rejected the proposition that good faith includes a requirement of reasonable

and Hayne JJ at   Kirby J at     and Callinan J at   the High Court declined to decide the issue of the existence and content of such an obligation  At that time  the authorities relevant to the implied term of   fair dealing  were collected and discussed by Finn J in Hughes Aircraft Systems at      It is unnecessary to traverse either those authorities or the more recent decisions that have considered the issue   Earlier in Hughes Aircraft Systems at     Finn J described the implied duty in more general terms  He said          I consider a virtue of the implied duty to be that it expresses in a generalisation of universal application  the standard of conduct to which all contracting parties are to be expected to adhere throughout the lives of their contracts            iv  The difficulty with the contextual standard or a   generalisation of universal application     Hughes Aircraft Systems at   is to identify the precise boundaries of this standard  It has evaded the grasp

amendments made by the tax and property groups are also now included and highlighted      I make the following comments regarding the property related amendments             I have assumed that Latitude is purchasing all the shares in  EHD   On that basis  I have simply included the development rights as part of the Business of EHD since Latitude will take over that Business at completion                     You should be aware that the Business of EHD as defined in the Agreement is broader than the construction of the Stage   and  A Apartments  The Agreement defines the Business as the business of developing              the apartments already constructed as at the date of the Sale of Shares Agreement      the apartments to be constructed  including the Stage   and  A Apartments             Was this agreed  My concern is that there may be carry over obligations from Stages   and   for which Latitude may become liable  If this has not been agreed between the parties  I suggest that either the Business be limited to the Stage   and  A Apartments or Latitude obtain warranties and indemnities with respect to the previous Stages         The dates for the construction milestones are different to those set out in the  HofA   I have amended the Sale of Shares Agreement to comply with the milestone dates set out in the  HofA   Please let me know if you have agreed different

lessee  Latitude contended that the lodgement of the caveat was consistent with its right to terminate for the repudiatory breach by BreakFree that the lodgement of the caveat could not be characterised as an election by Latitude to affirm the HofA  An inference of affirmation will not be drawn from conduct just because it is consistent with the existence or the continuation of the relevant contract  Immer  No   Pty Ltd v The Uniting Church in Australia Property Trust  NSW    HCA         CLR    As Brennan J said  at        An act amounting to an election must be unequivocal  Where a contract can be terminated at the option of a promisee  the right to terminate is not necessarily lost by the promisee doing any act consistent with the continuance of the contract  If the act is also consistent with the reservation of a right to terminate in certain events  the right to terminate is not lost by the doing of the act        Footnotes omitted     See also Chitty on Contracts   vol       th ed  at       Judged in that light  it cannot be said that the lodging of the caveat was unequivocal or not consistent with the reservation of a right to terminate  So much was made clear by the letter from Middletons to Maddocks of   August    see   above   An election to terminate is a restricted right which may be effected after some delay by communicating that the contract is at end  see Cheshire and Fifoot s The Law of Contract     th ed  at     and      There was no such delay in the present case   In the circumstances  it is neither necessary nor appropriate to go on and consider  if Latitude had affirmed the HofA  whether it immediately breached the HofA      by failing to provide the Second and Third Bank Guarantees and further or alternatively  the charge required under cl   of the HofA    by failing to negotiate under cl   of the HofA   For the reasons outlined earlier  none of these matters  taken singularly or collectively  viewed objectively  evinced an intention on the part of Latitude not to be bound by the HofA  Contrary to BreakFree s submissions  the losses suffered by Latitude were not attributable to its own conduct but the wrongful conduct of BreakFree  repudiatory conduct which Latitude accepted  BreakFree s counterclaim is dismissed referred toLam v Ausintel Investments Australia Pty Ltd     FLR   In the circumstances  I am not persuaded that Latitude was misled by BreakFree  Though private contractual negotiations involving a corporation in trade or commerce may support a claim for a breach of s   of the TPA  it is important to

Adelaide Petroleum NL Ltd     ALR   at   and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Oceania Commercial Pty Ltd   FCA   at         The relationship between Latitude and BreakFree was that of

development  either in relation to the Erskine on the Beach Project or other projects  This is reinforced by the evidence outlined above  Similarly  any non disclosure by BreakFree about its commercial intentions should a long form contract not be struck with Latitude cannot be construed as misleading or to have misled Latitude referred toMallozzi v Carapelli SpA     Lloyd s Rep   Traditionally  agreements to negotiate in   good faith   were viewed as unenforceable due to want of certainty or lack of consideration  eg Carr v Brisbane City Council   St R Qd   Mallozzi v Carapelli SpA     Lloyd s Rep   and Walford v Miles     AC   at   cited by Einstein J in Aiton Australia Pty Ltd v Transfield Pty Ltd   NSWSC         FLR   at    consideredMasters v Cameron   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Two matters are not in dispute  First  Latitude and BreakFree were bound by the HofA  a final agreement within the first category of Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at   namely a contract       in which the parties  had  reached finality in arranging all the terms of their bargain and intend ed  to be immediately bound to the performance of those terms  but at the same time propose d  to have the terms restated in a form which  would  be fuller and more precise but not different in effect        Clause     of the HofA adopted this language   The binding nature and effect of the HofA was repeatedly reinforced by counsel for BreakFree  As Senior Counsel for BreakFree submitted  it was a contract binding the parties at once to perform the agreed terms whether the completed formal document came into existence or not and       in those circumstances  all you can say is that if there is the appropriate clause to require negotiation  or if there is the negotiation then  in those circumstances  there will be a long form agreement if the parties reach agreement        Emphasis added  One of the matters binding the parties on execution of the HofA was that cll     and     of the HofA imposed a mutual obligation on the parties to negotiate the terms of a long form contract and to conduct those negotiations in good faith  That is the second matter not in dispute  However  until execution of such a long form contract  if at all  and subject to any agreement to vary the terms of the HofA  the parties remained bound by the terms of the HofA to buy and sell the Developer s Assets   BreakFree submitted that it was possible to read down cl       of the HofA and that the provision of additional security was consistent with the objective intention of the parties irrespective of whether finality  in the form of an Long Form Contract  was in fact reached by the   August    This construction was said to be supported by considerations of business efficacy  Priority should be given  it was submitted  to preserving the parties  intention to be immediately bound even if the form of the arrangement was imperfect  Masters v Cameron at       There are at least three reasons why these submissions should be rejected  Both relate to the terms of cl       of the HofA  First  cl       required that Latitude provide the charge or mortgage on the   Possession Date    This date was not defined by the HofA and must refer to the date on which Latitude took possession of the assets which it sought to acquire from BreakFree  Contrary to BreakFree s submission  the obligation to provide the charge was contingent on performance by BreakFree of its obligation to deliver these assets  defined in cl   as the assets of the Developer s Business  Latitude never took possession of these assets and could not be understood as undertaking  by cl       to confer on BreakFree a benefit unsupported by prior consideration  The second basis relates to the identification of the relevant consideration   the assets of the Developer s Business  Latitude could not provide security in respect of assets it did not possess   Thirdly  the contention ignores the express terms of the HofA and the effect of it  The HofA was  as BreakFree submitted  see   above  a contract which  subject to the conditions precedent being satisfied  bound Latitude to purchase the Developer s Assets for     million  For the reasons set out above  the conditions precedent were satisfied  Latitude was bound to purchase those assets  The failure of Latitude to provide additional security pursuant to cl       of the HofA in relation to the long form contract did not constitute a breach of the HofA and  further  did not evince an intention on the part of Latitude no longer to be bound by the HofA appliedMeehan v Jones   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It is a composite clause  It appears to involve two concepts     negotiations in good faith     but directed at a particular end    to ensure that the terms set out in these  HofA  are given full effect    The phrase   negotiations in good faith   is not a defined term  That does not necessarily make the requirement uncertain  In Coal Cliff at   Kirby P acknowledged that       i n a small number of cases  by reference to a readily ascertainable external standard  the court may be able to add flesh to a provision which is otherwise unacceptably vague or uncertain or apparently illusory  see eg  Powell v Jones   SASR   at   Sweet and Maxwell Ltd v Universal News Services Ltd     QB   cf Meehan v Jones   HCA         CLR   at   Jillcy Film Enterprises   Inc v Home Box Office Inc   F Supp   at      and  Ridgeway Coal Co Inc v FMC Corporation   F Supp     at      Against that background  two matters must be noted at the outset  A term stipulating that parties   will conduct all such negotiations in good faith   is a contractual term  In Meehan v Jones   HCA         CLR   at   Gibbs CJ said that       It is only if the court is unable to put any definite meaning on the contract that it can be said to be uncertain   If it is possible to attribute a definite meaning to cl     of the HofA  even if there be more than one possible meaning  the requirement that the parties negotiate in good faith will not be void for uncertainty  Meehan v Jones at   citing Upper Hunter County District Council v Australian Chilling and Freezing Co Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    per Barwick CJ   The question whether the court is capable of putting a definite meaning on cl     raises additional issues   when  how  why and by reference to what standard or principles is the clause to be given a definite meaning  How is one person s bargaining to be judged to be in breach of a promise or a duty to negotiate in good faith  Is a higher duty to be imposed in certain and  if so  what circumstances  Do the additional words   to ensure that the terms set out in these Heads of Agreement are given full effect  in cl     of the HofA assist in providing certainty or add to its uncertainty  What do these additional words mean referred toOverlook Management BV v Foxtel Management Pty Ltd   ACR     Specific conduct has also been identified by various courts as constituting

as the subsequent discussion will reveal  I am not to be taken as accepting that such a duty  however defined  exists    ii  First  it ignores the principles concerning repudiation  The relevant principles were summarised by Finn and Sundberg JJ in Pacific Brands Sport   Leisure Pty Ltd v Underworks Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR   at   and   as follows           The principles governing repudiation of a contract are  as we understand it  not in issue and for present purposes can be stated shortly                   i  A party will have repudiated a contract if  by words or conduct  it evinces an intention no longer to be bound by it or if that party shows it intends to fulfil the contract only in a manner substantially inconsistent with its obligations and not in any other way  Shevill v Builders Licensing Board   HCA         CLR   at     Laurinda Pty Ltd v Capalaba Park Shopping Centre Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR         ii  The party s conduct is to be judged objectively by reference to the effect it would be reasonably calculated to have upon a reasonable person  Laurinda Pty Ltd v Capalaba Park Shopping Centre Pty Ltd at   above  Satellite Estate Pty Ltd v Jacquet     SR  NSW    at                     iii  A party that acts on a genuine but erroneous view of its obligations under the contract will not for that reason alone have repudiated it  That party may still be willing to perform the contract according to its tenor  DTR Nominees Pty Ltd v Mona Homes Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     Woodar Investment Development Ltd v Wimpey Construction UK Ltd   UKHL         WLR    But persistence in an untenable construction will ordinarily be regarded as repudiatory  Summers v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at   and see Chitty on Contracts                   We would note  additionally  that in the case of contracts of significant duration in which interaction and some level of cooperation is required  it is common for parties without formally varying their contract to conduct their dealings inter se in ways that they find acceptable and convenient  fair and reasonable  or commercially necessary  rather than by reference to a priori rights and duties  cf Integrated Computer Services Pty Ltd v Digital Equipment Corporation  Aust  Pty Ltd     BPR   at     Secondly  the conduct of Latitude identified by BreakFree did not  judged objectively by reference to the effect it would be reasonably calculated to have upon a reasonable person  evince an intention no longer to be bound by the HofA   Latitude s failure to provide  request or even secure the Third Bank Guarantee was entirely referable to the fact that  on   August   Frawley agreed that Latitude would only provide one more bank guarantee  a fact he confirmed to his solicitor  see   above  This was the type of conduct that Finn and Sundberg JJ considered in   of Pacific Brands Sport   Leisure Pty Ltd v Underworks Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR     Further  a request to extend the deadline for the satisfaction of cl   of the HofA was not  as submitted by counsel for BreakFree  identical to the procedure for extension of deadlines for the satisfaction of conditions precedent under cl     of the HofA  Clause     of the HofA applied to all other contractual variations and required the formal execution of a new deed  Its terms are mandatory    t hese  HofA  may only be varied or replaced by a document duly executed by the parties    Time was of the essence  cl     and would  in relation to the provision of guarantees  have required formal amendment of the HofA  The efficacy of engaging in the procedure for formal amendment is questionable given that the parties  attention  in the week prior to   August   was directed to a range of additional matters  including the warranties and other amendments sought by Latitude and communicated by its solicitors to BreakFree on   August    see  ff  above   In the circumstances  it was reasonable for Latitude to continue its negotiations on these matters without piecemeal amendment under cl     in respect of individual clauses such as the provision of guarantees under cl    The draft Sale of Shares Agreement forwarded by Middletons on   August   was consistent with an intention that there be global amendments to the HofA in the form of a   document duly executed by the parties  pursuant to cl       BreakFree s reference to the failure of Latitude to provide the Second Bank Guarantee under the HofA by   August   erroneously focuses on only part of the circumstances which are to be judged objectively  Considered objectively  in light of all the circumstances  including the fact that Thompson had requested and received the bank guarantee from the Bank as early as   August   and that all remained was for he and his wife to sign and fax the document  it cannot be said that the failure of Latitude to provide the Second Bank Guarantee to BreakFree  whether taken singularly or with any other fact or facts  evinced an intention on the part of Latitude no longer to be bound by the HofA referred toPierce Bell Sales Pty Ltd v Frazer   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Australia  part of the impetus for the recognition of a implied duty to act in good faith has been the desirability and practice of courts in controlling reliance on general rescission clauses so as to prevent their use   for improper and extraneous purposes   see Godfrey Constructions Pty Ltd v Kanangra Park Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   Pierce Bell Sales Pty Ltd v Frazer   HCA         CLR   at    per Barwick CJ  and Burger King at    In light of these matters and of the foregoing analysis  the issue is whether the conduct of BreakFree  in the course of negotiations and ultimately relying on its power to terminate the HofA under cl       judged objectively  demonstrated a lack of good faith referred toPoseidon Ltd v Adelaide Petroleum NL     ALR   It was common ground that s   of the TPA prohibited BreakFree or any person acting on behalf of BreakFree from engaging in conduct   in trade or commerce  that was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive and that the phrase    in trade or commerce   was sufficiently broad to apply to the private contractual negotiations between Latitude and BreakFree  Poseidon Ltd v Adelaide Petroleum NL   ATPR      see also definition of  conduct  in s  b  of the TPA    Latitude s allegations fell into two categories      representations made by Smith and Frawley relevant to BreakFree s capacity or intention to develop the site and to on sell the Development Assets and the Stage   Assets to Latitude  Representations relating to BreakFree s Status as Manager  and    representations by Frawley that BreakFree agreed to vary cl   of the HofA so that it was not conditional on Deposits Condition Precedent   The statutory questions relevant to each category of representation overlap with the inquiries at common law relating to the obligation to negotiate in good faith and the construction of the parties  agreement in relation to the status of the Deposits Condition Precedent on   August    Factual findings already made in relation to the common law claims are pertinent to the resolution of the TPA claims   Latitude contends that during the course of negotiating the terms of the HofA  BreakFree misrepresented to Latitude that it did not intend to develop the Erskine site  and was uninterested in representing itself in the market as a developer  and failed to disclose to Latitude that it reserved its rights to undertake the development if the parties  terminated the HofA   In the circumstances  I am not persuaded that Latitude was misled by BreakFree  Though private contractual negotiations involving a corporation in trade or commerce may support a claim for a breach of s   of the TPA  it is important to distinguish infringing conduct from representations that are apposite

faith  Finkelstein J in Garry Rogers Motors stated that  provided the party exercising the power acts reasonably in all the circumstances  the duty to act fairly and in good faith will ordinarily be

have considered the issue   There is a lack of consensus about the content of the requirement of good faith in negotiations  That is not surprising  The High Court declined to enter the debate in

failing to act  reasonably  in general  I consider this requirement in further detail below   In light of the conclusions earlier set out  it is also unnecessary to consider and resolve Latitude s complaint that BreakFree breached its duty to negotiate in good faith  However  for the sake of completeness  I made the following observations  The legal analysis of the express and implied duty to negotiate in good faith set out above is relevant  It must be recalled that the context in which impugned conduct is said to arise is relevant  Here  BreakFree and Latitude were negotiating in the commercial context of vendor and purchaser   Bad faith  or conduct imputing an absence of  good faith  takes on particular meaning where a vendor  in the position of BreakFree  seeks to use a power of rescission to resile late in the course of negotiations  Viscount Radcliffe s comments in Selkirk at     are instructive           it has been said that a vendor  in seeking to rescind  must not act arbitrarily  or capriciously  or unreasonably  Much less can he act in bad faith  He may not use the power of rescission to get out of a sale  brevi manu  since by doing so he makes a nullity of the whole elaborate and protracted transaction  Above all   he must not be guilty of  recklessness  in entering into his contract  a term  connoting  an unacceptable indifference to the situation of a purchaser who is allowed to enter into a contract with the expectation of obtaining a title which the vendor has no reasonable anticipation of being able to deliver  A vendor who has so acted is not allowed to call of the whole transaction by resorting to the contractual right of rescission     consideredSouth Sydney District Rugby League Football Club Ltd v News Ltd     ALR   The final category ties the impugned conduct directly to the content of the contract in question  In South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club Ltd v News Ltd     ALR   at   Finn J noted that the         positive content of the good faith requirement was what Professor L cke has described as  loyalty  to that which actually had been promised and agreed   see L cke   Good Faith and Contractual Performance  in Finn  ed  Essays on Contract        see also the normative view of Fried  Contract as Promise     ff  or  to put the matter negatively  was to preclude what the Restatement  Second  Contracts refers to as   evasion of the spirit of the bargain   see SS  comment d  Farnsworth  Contracts    nd ed    SS    p          Emphasis added     v  Although as noted above  the boundaries of good faith evade precise definition  there appears to be at least some consensus on the limits of any such duty  In particular  a duty of good faith      is not fiduciary in nature        does not require a party to subordinate its own interests  let alone act selflessly  and      does not require a party to restrict decisions and actions  reasonably taken  which are designed to promote the legitimate interests of a party and which are not otherwise in breach of an express contractual term   See Justice Finn  Good Faith and Fair Dealing  Australia  Commercial Good Faith Conference  Auckland  New Zealand

possible to attribute a definite meaning to cl     of the HofA  even if there be more than one possible meaning  the requirement that the parties negotiate in good faith will not be void for uncertainty  Meehan v Jones at   citing Upper Hunter County District Council v Australian Chilling and Freezing Co Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    per Barwick CJ   The question whether the court is capable of putting a definite meaning on cl     raises additional issues   when  how  why and by reference to what standard or principles is the clause to be given a definite meaning  How is one person s bargaining to be judged to be in breach of a promise or a duty to negotiate in good faith  Is a higher duty to be imposed in certain and  if so  what circumstances  Do the additional words   to ensure that the terms set out in these Heads of Agreement are given full effect  in cl     of the HofA assist in providing certainty or add to its uncertainty  What do these additional words mean referred toVodafone Pacific Ltd v Mobile Innovations Ltd   NSWCA  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  Although no implied duty to negotiate in good faith was pleaded or relied on  it is convenient to consider the issue for such light that it sheds upon the express duty that was both pleaded and relied on  There has been a recent willingness of Australia Courts to find that a duty of   good faith   in negotiations is an implied or incidental term of every commercial contract unless the duty is either excluded expressly or by necessary implication  Pacific Brands Sport   Leisure Pty

Minister for Public Works     NSWLR    referred toWalford v Miles     AC   Traditionally  agreements to negotiate in   good faith   were viewed as unenforceable due to want of certainty or lack of consideration  eg Carr v Brisbane City Council   St R Qd   Mallozzi v Carapelli SpA     Lloyd s Rep   and Walford v Miles     AC   at   cited by Einstein J in Aiton Australia Pty Ltd v Transfield Pty Ltd   NSWSC         FLR   at      The agreement was considered  certain  because   B and C must negotiate  B because it is bound to A to do so and C because it is bound to B to do so  and there is a process for resolving any disagreement between B   C    at    Hayne J distinguished the agreement in Con Kallergis from that considered by the House of Lords in Walford  The latter was found to be uncertain because either party could break off negotiations at any time and for any reason
