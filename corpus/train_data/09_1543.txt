http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThis Court may permit new grounds to be raised on appeal which were not raised before the Federal Magistrates Court  But there are very real reasons why it should not too readily do so  including  the fact that the relevant jurisdiction conferred on this Court is an appellate jurisdiction  the fact that this Court  in exercising that appellate jurisdiction  is entitled to the not inconsiderable benefit of the reasons for decision of a Federal Magistrate in respect to the issues sought to be agitated by a party to the proceeding  the principle that a party who has had a case resolved against him should usually not be permitted on appeal to raise a completely new or different case to that previously advanced  the principle that to permit a whole new case to be run on appeal has the potential to undermine the appellate process by rendering the trial process almost irrelevant  the fact that there is a legitimate public interest in public law matters being resolved in a timely and efficient manner and that the Minister has a legitimate interest in the timely resolution of applications for protection visas  and the fact that the High Court  in the event that an application for special leave to appeal is granted  is entitled to the benefit of a decision at first instance on the arguments sought to be resolved and to this Court s reasons for decision in respect to the same issues on appeal  To pursue any other course is to shift to the High Court the appellate role which it is the responsibility of this Court to discharge   These are but some of the matters that have been referred to in earlier decisions of this Court  e g  Iyer v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at       FCA

Lander J  SZMRD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   per Spender J affirmedSZNSL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  htmlOn   July   the Appellant filed an Application in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia  The grounds upon which that Application was advanced were expressed as follows  without alteration  The Tribunal denied procedural fairness at the time of the assessment of applicant claim The Refugee Review Tribunal s decision was unjust and was made without taking into account the full gravity of the applicant s circumstances of the decision    That Court addressed those grounds and dismissed the Application on   September   SZNSL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FMCA    In the course of resolving these two grounds  the Federal Magistrate also set forth the Tribunal s analysis of s   of the Migration Act    Cth   the   Migration Act   and its application to the now Appellant  A Notice of Appeal was thereafter filed with this Court on   October    The Grounds of Appeal were expressed as follows  without alteration      The Tribunal made a jurisdictional error  by failing to apply the correct test to determine that there was a real chance of persecution  in assessing whether the appellant s fear of persecution was well founded          His Honor committed an error of law in dismissing that the decision involved a jurisdictional error of law involving an incorrect interpretation of the applicable law to the facts of the case found by the Refugee Review Tribunal  The Tribunal decision was an improper exercise of the power conferred by the Migration Act or the regulations  The Appellant appeared before this Court on   November   unrepresented  although he did have the benefit of an interpreter citedVUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  It must always be recognised  however  that leave to raise a ground of appeal which was not previously relied upon may be granted where   it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so   VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at     The reference in the Grounds of Appeal to the Tribunal s alleged failure   to apply the correct test to determine that there was a real chance of persecution   permitted  perhaps  of some ambiguity  On one view  the Ground could be construed as a broadly expressed challenge to  the correct construction and application of s   of the Migration Act    On another view  the Ground could be construed as a challenge to  the findings made by the Tribunal in respect to the   chance of persecution   confronting the now Appellant   It is not considered that the alternative manner of expressing the Grounds of Appeal raises any different issue
