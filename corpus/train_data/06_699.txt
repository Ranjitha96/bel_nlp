Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Reid  No     FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedDietrich v The Queen   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html   such further or other orders as the Court deems appropriate     Accompanying the notice of motion  as required under O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   was the Statement of Charge which claimed that the contempt committed by the respondent was wilful and contumacious insofar as           in breach of paragraph   of the order of the Honourable Justice Jenkinson of this Court  made on   March   wherein the respondent was prohibited from managing corporations until   August   the respondent has been involved in the management of the following corporations                  Battstone Australia Pty Ltd between about   March   and   June   and                 Australian Marble Pty Ltd between about   February   and   July   and                in breach of an oral undertaking provided to the Honourable Justice Kenny on   October   that he would not be involved in the management of a company in any form at all in the future  the respondent has been involved in the management of the following corporations                  Battstone Australia Pty Ltd between about   March   and   June   and                 Australian Marble Pty Ltd between about   February   and   July         The complete history of this proceeding can be found in my reasons for judgment in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Reid   FCA        Relevantly  the matter was listed for hearing on   November    However  on   November   the respondent  who was then represented by a solicitor  applied for an adjournment  I refused the application  On   November   who was then unrepresented  applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground that he was indigent and without legal assistance  Dietrich v The Queen   HCA         CLR     Dietrich    I refused the application and indicated that I would give my reasons at a later date  These are the reasons for my refusal of that application     The procedure which is to be adopted where a party brings contempt proceedings against another party for contempt is regulated by O   of the Federal Court Rules and  in particular  O   r   which provides      Subject to subrule   the evidence in support of a charge shall be by affidavit        The Court may permit evidence in support of a charge to be given otherwise than by affidavit   The procedure is different from criminal proceedings  where proceedings do not ordinarily go forward on affidavit evidence   There is a long line of authority to suggest that the principle established by Dietrich as to the use of the Court s inherent power to stay or adjourn proceedings until legal representation is obtained relates only to criminal proceedings   The principle in Dietrich was explained in the joint judgment of Mason CJ  Dawson  Toohey and McHugh JJ in New South Wales v Canellis   Ors   HCA         CLR     Canellis   in the following terms  at          the principle established by the decision in that case is that a court has jurisdiction to grant an adjournment or order a permanent stay of proceedings at a trial until such time as an indigent person charged with a serious criminal offence is provided with legal representation necessary for a fair trial or resources for such representation   In McGibbon v Linkenbagh     ALD   at   Kiefel J said     The principle established by Dietrich v R   HCA         ALR     CLR   as to the use of a court s inherent powers to stay or adjourn proceedings until legal representation is obtained  where it concludes it is necessary for a fair trial  refers only to criminal proceedings  New South Wales v Canellis   HCA         ALR     Williams v Official Trustee     ALR       It is not authority for the proposition that in other proceedings or inquiries such a step would be required by dictates of fairness  even where someone faced potentially serious consequences   In Commissioner of Taxation  Cth  v La Rosa     ALR   Nicholson J considered that the Dietrich principle did not apply in the context of a hearing before the Aministrative Appeals Tribunal  stating  at       Dietrich decided that the common law of Australia does not recognise the right of an accused person to be provided with counsel at the public expense but the courts have power to stay criminal proceedings that will result in an unfair trial  In Nguyen v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     FCR  the Full Court of the Federal Court held that the Dietrich principle had no application in the circumstances of a decision of a tribunal in deportation proceedings  see   and   of Nguyen   There the court referred to the decision in New South Wales v Canellis   HCA         CLR     ALR   where the limited scope of the Dietrich principle was recognised  Mason CJ  Dawson  Toohey and McHugh JJ stating it was concerned with the right to a fair trial of a party to criminal proceedings  at CLR    The Full Court in Nguyen considered it was clear the High Court did not favour the extension of the Dietrich principle into the field of administrative review   More recently  in Rivera v United States of America   FCAFC     Heerey  Sundberg and Crennan JJ considered whether the principle in Dietrich applied to a review of extradition proceedings under s   of the Extradition Act    Cth   the Act   Their Honours firstly considered s   of the Act  which provided     In the proceedings  the person to whom the proceedings relate is not entitled to adduce  and the magistrate is not entitled to receive  evidence to contradict an allegation that the person has engaged in conduct constituting an extradition offence for which the surrender of the person is sought   In a joint judgment  their Honours said  at        This provision ensures that the merits of the criminal charge are not in issue in the proceedings concerning surrender and there can be no risk that the appellant will incriminate himself if the legislation is adhered to as it has been during the course of this matter  Having as its source and origin an accused person s common law right to a fair trial  the principle in Dietrich s case has  in our view  no application to a review of extradition proceedings under s   of the Extradition Act       This view is consistent with unanimous views of the High Court in Canellis   In the joint judgment of Mason CJ  Dawson  Toohey and McHugh JJ at   their Honours said               the principle established by the decision in that case  Dietrich  is that a court has jurisdiction to grant an adjournment or order a permanent stay of proceedings at a trial until such time as an indigent person charged with a serious criminal offence is provided with legal representation necessary for a fair trial or resources for such representation  As the majority judgments made clear  the principle is based on  and derives from  the accused s right to a fair trial      There is no suggestion in the majority judgments that a court could exercise a similar jurisdiction in civil proceedings or in committal proceedings  nor do they suggest that such a jurisdiction could be exercised in favour of an indigent person charged with a criminal offence which is other than serious  Furthermore  and this is of decisive importance in the present case  the principle in Dietrich is concerned with the right to a fair trial of a party to criminal proceedings                There is nothing in the facts of this case which would support the application of the principle in Dietrich to these extradition proceedings as contended for by the appellant in reliance upon the observations of Kirby P in Canellis v Slattery   Furthermore there is no requirement for the appellant to seek special leave in person from the High Court  see Milat v R   HCA         ALR    Accordingly  we reject the submission that the Dietrich principle can be invoked in these extradition proceedings on the basis contended because no risk of conviction or self incrimination can arise in these proceedings conducted in accordance with the Extradition Act   for the purposes of determining eligibility for surrender   In the circumstances of this case  where the procedure to be adopted in the contempt proceeding is civil rather than criminal  the respondent s application to stay the proceedings on the basis of Dietrich had to fail because the principle in Dietrich has no application to civil proceedings  It was on this basis that the respondent s application was dismissed followedWitham v Holloway   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The High Court has recognised that contempt proceedings are civil  rather than criminal in nature  In Witham v Holloway   HCA         CLR   at   the High Court  in addressing the standard of proof to be applied in contempt proceedings  indicated that contempt proceedings are essentially criminal in nature  However  the majority indicated that the rights and procedural obligations ordinarily associated with a criminal trial are dispensed with in contempt proceedings  stating  at      It was submitted by counsel for the appellant that  if contempt proceedings are essentially criminal in nature  there is no power to order a retrial of the charges against the appellant     However  to say that proceedings for contempt are essentially criminal in nature is not to equate them with the trial of a criminal charge  There are clear procedural differences  the most obvious being that criminal charges ordinarily involve trial by jury  whereas charges of contempt do not  There is no basis  in our view  for importing into the law of contempt the nineteenth century rules which allowed a verdict of guilty  given in a jury trial  to be quashed on appeal  but did not permit of an order for retrial  Moreover  the issue  so far as contempt is concerned  is not whether there should be a retrial  but whether there should be a rehearing   The Court s reasons show that contempt proceedings  or at least the procedure to be adopted in them  is civil rather than criminal in nature even though a Court may find that a person has committed a criminal contempt appliedNew South Wales v Canellis   Ors   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The principle in Dietrich was explained in the joint judgment of Mason CJ  Dawson  Toohey and McHugh JJ in New South Wales v Canellis   Ors
