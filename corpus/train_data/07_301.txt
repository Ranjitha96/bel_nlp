deemed to constitute part of an employee s employment by the Commonwealth  The journeys which fall within the section are journeys which are to and from the employee s  employment by the Commonwealth   In Commonwealth of Australia v Duncan     ALR   the Full Court of this Court said that the question posed by s   was whether the employee was journeying to or from a state of activity called employment and not whether he was journeying to or from his place of employment  at   per Kelly J  at   per Fitzgerald J   The Tribunal member held that the circumstances of the case before him did not fall within the terms of s   because although the respondent was travelling to his place of employment  he was not travelling to his duties of employment   Sections   and   deem certain journeys to be journeys to the employee s employment by the Commonwealth for the purposes of s    I will focus on journeys to the employee s employment by the Commonwealth  Both of the sections are subject to the provisions of ss   and   but  subject to one matter which I will mention  those sections are not relevant for present purposes   Section   provides that where an employee  other than an employee to whom s   applies  makes a journey to his place of employment within the period prescribed in the section or if the journey would have ended within the prescribed period then he is deemed to have made a journey to his employment by the Commonwealth  The prescribed period is a period of one hour immediately before he commenced work or would have commenced work  An employee whose journey ended or would have ended before the prescribed period may nevertheless be deemed to have made a journey to his employment by the Commonwealth if   the journey was made by the last means of transport      i  that was conveniently available for use by the employee         ii  that would ordinarily have enabled the employee to complete the journey before the time at which he intended to commence work  and    iii  that was of a kind that the employee could  having regard to all the circumstances of the case  have been reasonably expected to use          s  b citedJames  Re  and Commonwealth of Australia

Commonwealth of Australia     ALR   The Tribunal member referred to two authorities  Maunder v Commonwealth of Australia     ALR   Re James and Commonwealth of Australia   AAT  N   Unreported  R K Todd    July   and then turned to consider whether the means of transport adopted by the respondent  ie driving his own motor vehicle  satisfied the three requirements in s  b i ii  and  iii   He held that the means of transport adopted by the respondent did satisfy the requirements and he said that the following were  some  of the relevant circumstances         The applicant used his own personal vehicle as the means of transport in accordance with what was obviously a long established practice and entitlement of Army personnel  The Army accepted that a soldier in the applicant s position was entitled to use his private vehicle to travel to his new posting and the Army was prepared to grant time and money to the applicant to facilitate that       If the applicant were to return to Holsworthy by air travel it would have been necessary for him to return to Perth from Kalgoorlie in order to do so       I accept the applicant s evidence that it was necessary and desirable to allow some leeway in travelling time so as to cater for the possibility of mechanical trouble and I also accept the evidence of the applicant and Mr March that it was normal for personnel arriving at a new base to arrive early  I note in passing that the current Army practice of calculating travel time on the basis of driving about   kilometres per day would imply a reasonable travelling time for the applicant of approximately   days  In my opinion it would have been unreasonable for a person in the applicant s position to have attempted to time his arrival at Holsworthy after such a long journey to the period between     pm on   September and     am on   September especially as he was expected to be fit for duty at     am   The Tribunal member then turned to consider if the means of transport adopted by the respondent was the last means of transport which satisfied s  b i   ii  and  iii   He decided that it was  although as to public transport he said no more than that  although public transport may have been an option for the  respondent  it was not an option that  in my opinion  satisfied the three provisos        For these reasons  the Tribunal member concluded that the journey was deemed to be a journey to the respondent s employment by the Commonwealth for the purposes of s   of the   Act and therefore part of his employment by the Commonwealth for the purposes of s   of that Act   I was referred to the decision of the Full Court of this Court in Maunder v Commonwealth of Australia  supra   That case concerned a claim by Captain Maunder s widow for compensation in relation to the death of Captain Maunder from injuries he sustained in an accident in his own motor vehicle some time after he had left a regimental depot  The Administrative Appeals Tribunal rejected the claim on the ground that the means of transport used by Captain Maunder  having regard to his inebriated state  was not one he could reasonably have been expected to use within s  b iii   It is true that the Court did not say transport by private motor vehicle could never be the  first  means of transport  the case involved a journey from work  within s  b  but the Tribunal had decided the case on a different ground and the only issue before the Full Court was whether the Tribunal had erred in law in doing so  The applicant sought to draw some support for its second submission from the following observation made by the Court  at      In speaking of the first available means of transport  s  b  read in its context is clearly referring to the means of transport first available to the employee after the employee ceased work  The legislative intention seems to be that  if the employee delays in leaving his place of employment and commencing his journey until after the prescribed period  he must  to obtain the benefit of s   show that a means of transport was not available to him during the prescribed period   The applicant submitted that this observation  appropriately adapted  applied equally to those provisions dealing with journeys to employment and that an employee like the respondent who could choose to leave in his own motor vehicle at a time such that he would arrive within the prescribed period did not fall within the provisions of s  b  of the Act  There is a good deal of force in this submission  However  I have reached the conclusion that if I were to accept the submission I would be reading words into the section which are not there  There is nothing in the section which requires the employee to show that there is no means of transport which would see him arrive within the prescribed period  or which provides that transport by private motor vehicle cannot be the last means of transport within the subsection because the employee can choose when to commence his journey and therefore  to a point in the case of a long journey  when he will arrive   Once these conclusions are reached  a conclusion that it was open to the Tribunal member to find that in the particular circumstances of this case the journey by the respondent in his own motor vehicle satisfied the requirements of s  b  is inevitable  The Army not only allowed him to drive his own motor vehicle to the Army base at Holsworthy but granted him leave to do so and contributed to the costs of doing so  In the particular circumstances of this case  transport in this way was not only a means of transport he could reasonably have been expected to use  but was the means of transport he could reasonably have been expected to use  I reject the applicant s challenge to the Tribunal member s conclusion that the case fell within the terms of s     I reject the applicant s submissions and  accordingly  the appeal must be dismissed  I will hear the parties as to the costs of the appeal   I certify that the preceding forty four   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Besanko    Associate Dated    March
