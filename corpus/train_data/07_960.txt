Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Fuelbanc Australia Limited   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAustralian Securities and Investments Commission v McDougall     ALR   Stephen McDougall earlier devised and operated a scheme known as  FullTank  which was wound up as an unregistered managed investment scheme by order of Young J on   April   Australian Securities and Investments Commission v McDougall     ALR     Under the FullTank scheme participants would pay a flat  Membership Fee  and a  Plan Fee   They were issued with a debit card which could be used to purchase fuel and other goods at service stations through the EFTPOS system  The debit card would be loaded each week with a nominated amount for purchases  The promise held out was that over a given period participants could receive an effective discount of   per cent  For example  for a Plan Fee of   the participant was promised   worth of fuel per week for   weeks   The FUELbanc scheme also involves debit cards issued for the purchase of fuel  Its distinguishing feature  however  is the use of a barter system known as  E Banc  in which goods and services are exchanged for barter units known as  trade dollars  as well as ordinary Australian currency  E Banc is operated by E Banc Trade Pty Ltd  That company is not connected with the defendants and is not involved in the present proceeding  E Banc maintains a central register where its members  barter units and balances and unit transfers are recorded   A number of courts have made declarations in cases involving contraventions which carried criminal penalties  albeit with no express discussion of the point raised in Intertax   Nevertheless  the consistent practice is a matter of considerable

eg McDougall at    While certainly the conduct of the corporate defendants and Stephen McDougall has been reprehensible  the actual declarations do no more than declare the bare facts that the defendants operated an unregistered managed investment scheme and carried on a financial services business without a licence  The declarations would be equally appropriate if the defendants  business had been carried on with exemplary prudence and meticulous bookkeeping  A more satisfactory rationale may be that the right declared will be a public right  In Tobacco Institute  at   Sheppard J said that the declaration in that case would          be a declaration of right because the right which will be declared will be a public right  namely  the right of the public not to be misled or deceived

body corporate  exception  see   above  does not apply  The purpose of this exception is to ensure that the ordinary engagement of a company in commercial activities does not come within the managed investment scheme regime  The contract created by a company s constitution  see now Corporations Act s   only affords rights or imposes obligations on a member in his or her capacity as a member  Hickman v Kent or Romney Marsh Sheep Breeders  Association     Ch   at    The essence of the FUELbanc scheme is that a participant provides  trade dollars  and cash in return for a promise to provide credit for the purchase of fuel over a future period  The legal foundation for this arrangement is not membership of the company but the contractual relationship between the company and the participant  Relevantly for present purposes  the participant becomes a member of the scheme whether or not he or she becomes a member of the company   In any event  ASIC has been unable to discover any membership registers  minutes or other records which might prove that participants in fact became members   Section  B of the Corporations Act provides     For the purposes of this Chapter  ie Chapter   Financial Services and Markets  a person  the investor  makes a financial investment if           a  the investor gives money or money s worth  the contribution  to another person and any of the following apply           i  the other person uses the contribution to generate a financial return  or other benefit  for the investor     ii  the investor intends that the other person will use the contribution to generate a financial return  or other benefit  for the investor  even if no return or benefit is in fact generated     iii  the other person intends that the contribution will be used to generate a financial return  or other benefit  for the investor  even if no return or benefit is in fact generated  and          b  the investor has no day to day control over the use of the contribution to generate the return or benefit   Participants in the FUELbanc scheme are making a  financial investment  within the meaning of s  B because they give money to FUELbanc which uses the contribution to generate a financial return or other benefit for the participant  The participant intends that FUELbanc will use the contribution to generate a financial return or other benefit for him or her and FUELbanc intends that the contribution will be used to generate a financial return or other benefit for the participants  In all these respects the contribution is caught even if no return or benefit is in fact generated citedAustralian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd     ACSR   In respect of the FUELbanc unregistered managed investment scheme  was Stephen McDougall a person  operat ing  the scheme within the meaning of s  EE  As Davies AJ said in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd     ACSR   at      The term  operate  is not used to refer to ownership or proprietorship but rather to the acts which constitute the management of or the carrying out of the activities

noted  the orders sought by ASIC were not opposed  Mr Scott very properly drew my attention to the decision of Fryberg J of the Supreme Court of Queensland in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Intertax Holdings   QSC     a case which also concerned an unregistered managed investment scheme  His Honour declined to make a declaration against two individuals involved on the ground that the possibility of a prosecution was open and ASIC had refused to give any undertaking that prosecution would not follow  His Honour said  at      Where the possibility of the prosecution is open  it would  in my judgment  be contrary to the ordinary practice for the authority of this Court to be given to a declaration which  in substance  amounted to a declaration that the defendant had committed a crime  One should not make a declaration which might be falsified by a subsequent acquittal in proceedings between the same parties      In the present case ASIC does not rule out the possibility of future criminal proceedings against the defendants   While courts are still reluctant to grant declaratory relief on issues which are theoretical or hypothetical  see Zamir and Woolf  op cit    et seq  the Intertax argument against the grant of declaratory relief is based on a hypothetical fact  indeed a hypothesis upon a hypothesis that there will be a prosecution and that such prosecution will result in an acquittal   In Intertax Fryberg J  at   distinguished Australian Softwood on the ground that the High Court s approval          was to the proposition that a declaration could be granted notwithstanding that an injunction would not be granted      If by this his Honour meant that the High Court only granted a declaration because  with the consent of the parties  they did not grant an injunction  then I do not agree  Gibbs CJ said  at      With all respect  Hutley JA was not correct in saying that declarations  are little more than prefatory averments to the grant of an injunction   In my opinion it was proper to grant a declaration in the present case although it is now agreed that an injunction is not an appropriate remedy      In any case  if it were only appropriate to make declarations where injunctions were not granted  that would not get over the supposed problem of possible  falsification  by subsequent acquittal in criminal proceedings   A number

  CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  There is high authority against the supposed limitation on the exercise of the discretionary power to grant declaratory relief  In Sankey v Whitlam   HCA         CLR   the High Court  in respect of then current committal proceedings  ie actual  not hypothetical  criminal proceedings  made declarations that  i  certain documents were privileged from production and that  ii  the information laid against Mr Whitlam was bad in law  Gibbs ACJ said at        It is well established that the power of the court to make a declaration  under a provision such as s   of the Supreme Court Act    N S W   as amended  or O    r    of the Rules of this Court  is a very wide one  Forster v  Jododex Aust  Pty  Ltd     HCA         CLR   at pp       It is clear enough that the power of the court is not excluded because the matter as to which a declaration is sought may fall for decision in criminal proceedings  Indeed in Dyson v  Attorney General     KB   which is one of the foundations of the law on this subject  it was held that the court had power to make a declaration that the plaintiff was not under any obligation to comply with the requisitions contained in a notice sent to him by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue  notwithstanding that neglect to comply with the notice was an offence see especially per Farwell L J    KB  at p    Since that time there have been many cases in which the courts have made declarations in relation to questions which could have fallen for decision in criminal proceedings   His Honour observed  at   that while ordinarily a declaration is not made that a defendant has committed a crime  there was no doubt that there was jurisdiction to make such a declaration in a proper case  Imperial Tobacco Limited v Attorney General   AC   at   Sankey v Whitlam   Thus it was appropriate in many cases for a business person who is told by a regulatory authority that he or she cannot do something to apply for a declaration that the view is erroneous  Conversely  the right was mutual  the Crown could also obtain a declaration that the person s conduct contravened the law  That practice  which was common in New South Wales  had been given the  seal of approval  by the High Court in Australian Softwood  citedAustralian Softwood Forest Pty Ltd v Attorney General  NSW    HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Of direct application to the present case is Australian Softwood Forest Pty Ltd v Attorney General  NSW    HCA         CLR    The case concerned a pine plantation investment scheme which the Corporate Affairs Commission  NSW  alleged involved the issuing or offering of an  interest  contrary to s   of the Companies Act    NSW   The trial judge made a declaration to the effect alleged and granted injunctions  The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal but said that it was not a proper case for the grant of declarations  which were  little more than prefatory averments to the grant of an injunction   The High Court dismissed the substantive appeal  The parties accepted that an injunction was no longer necessary since the conduct in question was not continuing  The High Court nevertheless granted a declaration substantially to the effect of that granted by the trial judge   The contraventions the subject of the declaration in Australian Softwood carried criminal penalties  Companies Act  s    Murphy J thought this was a positive reason for the grant of a declaration  Certainly his Honour saw the possibility  indeed desirability  of criminal proceedings as no reason for refusing a declaration  His Honour commenced his judgment as follows at      One of the most widespread and successful of the species of fraud known in Australia and elsewhere as  the investment racket  is the forest or plantation variety      Later  at   his Honour said that the appellant          has already procured signatures and acceptances from more than   persons  This represents more than   in deposits and promises to pay instalments of well over a million dollars  Presumably all those who have been party to offences against the Companies Act in relation to the issues are liable to criminal proceedings  at least with the consent of the Minister  see s    In these circumstances  and because the respondent did not press in this Court for the injunction  I agree the relief should be confined to appropriate declarations   In Intertax Fryberg J  at   distinguished Australian Softwood on the ground that the High Court s approval          was to the proposition that a declaration could be granted notwithstanding that an injunction would not be granted      If by this his Honour meant that the High Court only

appropriateness of declarations in respect of breaches of the Companies  New South Wales  Code dealing with prescribed interests and offers to the public  Criminal proceedings were not only possible  they had taken place and the individual primarily involved had been convicted and was serving a term of imprisonment   Transphere does not provide any support for the limitation of the discretion to make declarations in cases like the present  indeed it is to the contrary   Secondly  it is said there must be  a proper contradictor  that is to say  some one presently existing who has a true interest to oppose the declaration sought  Russian Commercial   Industrial Bank v British Bank for Foreign Trade Ltd     AC   at   Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Transphere at     In the present case the defendants were represented but did not oppose the making of the declarations sought  or indeed any orders sought  Transphere is to an extent comparable in that the defendant in that case appeared and did not oppose the declaration  However  he we not legally represented  Young J  at     extensively reviewed the case law  His Honour  at   accepted the submission that the law as to declaratory judgments had developed to such a stage that declaration should be made unless there are proper grounds to the contrary  subject to the proviso that a  legitimate and powerful  factor against the grant would be the possibility of embarrassment in a practical sense to a non party  As has been noted   above  his Honour found that in the circumstances of the case before him such embarrassment did exist and on that ground declined a declaration   In the present case  there being no suggestion of any embarrassment to non parties in the present case

ACLC    Windeyer J  Supreme Court New South Wales  Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Sweeney   NSWSC    Austin J  Supreme Court of New South Wales  citedBMI Limited v Federated Clerks Union of Australia     ALR   Two final points  First  declarations will not usually be made when the only material before the Court is the consent of the parties  BMI Limited v Federated Clerks Union of Australia     ALR   at    As will have been apparent  in the present case ASIC has presented evidence and submissions   One of the authorities discussed by Young J was BMI   In that case Keely and Beaumont JJ  at   after referring to what was said by Buckley LJ and Scarman J in Wallersteiner v Moir     WLR   at   and   respectively  said          we think that it is generally undesirable that the court should grant relief by way of declaratory orders under s    of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act    Cth  in the absence of any contest on the question    Their Honours acknowledged  at   that  if it were demonstrated in a particular case that it were necessary that the question be resolved judicially  it may be appropriate for the court to appoint an amicus curiae to put the contrary view  if any  on the facts and on the questions of law which arise   In BMI not only was there no contradictor  but the particular question that was the subject of the proposed declaration had become academic  Moreover  there were a number of contrary arguments on the merits  see      The Full Court did not propound any binding proposition of law  still less one which would bind single judges deciding cases under investor protection provisions of corporations legislation   The suggestion of retaining counsel to put a contrary argument as amicus curiae raises the practical question as to who should foot the bill  Certainly it would be unreasonable to impose on the generosity of counsel who have volunteered for pro bono schemes  It is no function of the Court itself to expend money on filling a supposed gap in the range of arguments presented to it by the parties  And ASIC has limited public funds to spend on its important law enforcement functions citedRussian Commercial

citedForster v Jododex Australia Pty Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  There is high authority against the supposed limitation on the exercise of the discretionary power to grant declaratory relief  In Sankey v Whitlam   HCA         CLR   the High Court  in respect of then current committal proceedings  ie actual  not hypothetical  criminal proceedings  made declarations that  i  certain documents were privileged from production and that  ii  the information laid against Mr Whitlam was bad in law  Gibbs ACJ said at        It is well established that the power of the court to make a declaration  under a provision such as s   of the Supreme Court Act    N S W   as amended  or O    r    of the Rules of this Court  is a very wide one  Forster v  Jododex Aust  Pty  Ltd     HCA         CLR   at pp       It is clear enough that the power of the court is not excluded because the matter as to which a declaration is sought may fall for decision in criminal proceedings  Indeed in Dyson v  Attorney General     KB   which is one of the foundations of the law on this subject  it was held that the court had power to make a declaration that the plaintiff was not under any obligation to comply with the requisitions contained in a notice sent to him by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue  notwithstanding that neglect to comply with the notice was an offence see especially per Farwell L J    KB  at p    Since that time there have been many cases in which the courts have made declarations in relation to questions which could have fallen for decision in criminal proceedings   Secondly  it is said there must be  a proper contradictor  that is to say  some one presently existing who has a true interest to oppose the declaration
