Tobacco Australia Services Limited   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe application before this Court under s   is an application in the original jurisdiction of the Court  Having regard to the powers conferred upon the Court under s   of the Act  it is plain that it is not necessary on appeal under s   to determine whether the decision of the Registrar was correct when made  In that sense  the appeal proceeding is a hearing conducted  afresh  or de novo  like an appeal proceeding under s   of the Act  N V  Sumatra Tobacco Trading Company v British American Tobacco Australia Services Limited   FCA   on material properly placed before the Court   Blount Inc  v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR   at       FCA       IPR   at   Soncini v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR       IPR     Ostrowski Meissner v Registrar of Trade Marks     IPR   at   and    Section   is in these terms  On hearing an appeal against a decision or direction of the Registrar  the Federal Court may do any one or more of the following     a  admit further evidence orally  or on affidavit or otherwise   b  permit the examination and cross examination of witnesses  including witnesses who give evidence before the Registrar   c  order an issue of fact to be tried as it directs   d  affirm  reverse or vary the Registrar s decision or direction   e  give any judgment  or make any order  that  in all the circumstances  it thinks fit   f  order a party to pay costs to another party  The second application is an application by FCN as applicant for an order that TFN provide security for FCN s costs of and incidental to the appeal proceeding  That application although conceded by FCN to be novel  is made  it is said  on the footing that although FCN is the applicant in the proceeding  TFN ought to be regarded for all practical purposes as the prime mover or aggressor having initiated the application for removal of the trade mark before the Registrar  FCN says its appeal arises out of that  proceeding  and is responsive to it in the sense that FCN is exercising a right of appeal derivative of that proceeding  Therefore  it is said  s   of the Court Act in conjunction with Order   of the Federal Court Rules contemplates that an order for security for costs might be made against a respondent before this Court  who is  or was  an  applicant  in a proceeding before the Registrar of Trade Marks  That result is said to follow because Order   r   provides that references to an applicant  for the purposes of that Order   extend to any person who makes a claim for relief in any proceeding   Order   r    Secondly  FCN s application is said to be supported by the powers conferred on the Court by s   of the Act to make any order that in all the circumstances the Court thinks fit  s  e   FCN says s   should be read in conjunction with s   of the Act which confers power upon the Registrar of Trade Marks in these terms       If a person who neither resides nor carries on business in Australia       a        b  applies to the Registrar under Part   for a trade mark to be removed from the Register      the Registrar may require the person to give security for the costs of the proceeding and may  if security is not given  dismiss the proceeding  FCN says that the Court in hearing and determining an appeal under s   must be taken to have the same powers conferred upon it as those conferred under s   upon the Registrar or alternatively the empowering provision of s   confers sufficient power to enable an order to be made directing TFN to provide security for FCN s costs of and incidental to the hearing  assuming the relevant discretionary factors are made out  Principal among those for the moment are said to be that TFN ought to be characterised as the prime mover or aggressor and secondly  TFN is a partnership foreign to the jurisdiction with no assets within the jurisdiction  TFN says that FCN s application for security is misconceived because s   of the Court Act and Order   of the Federal Court Rules only contemplate orders for security for costs against an applicant or appellant or a person who  makes a claim for relief in any proceeding   Order   r    TFN says it makes no claim for relief in this proceeding and the reference in Order   r   can only be a reference to a proceeding in the Court  Thus  there is no power to make an order against a respondent who makes no claim upon an applicant  Secondly  s   of the Act confers power upon the Registrar and only the Registrar  in the circumstances of the section and is not a provision which confers power on the Court  Thirdly  FCN s notice of motion is confined to an order sought under s   and does not  in terms  rely upon s    Fourthly  s   is directed to the powers of the Court in the hearing and determination of an appeal and does not confer power to make an order for security for costs  The power to do so in a s   proceeding before the Court is  it is said  determined by the Court Act and the Federal Court Rules   TFN s application for security TFN says in reliance upon an affidavit by Mr Anthony Bennett sworn   December   that FCN is a company that operates a website described as  The Food Channel   By FCN s website material it describes itself as a company founded in   that utilises the internet and television as the medium for distributing multimedia productions to promote a range of services and products in a range of regions  TFN says that FCN is a company which has one issued share of     in paid up capital and Mr Lawrence is the only shareholder  TFN says that searches fail to reveal any significant assets held by FCN  Further  TFN says that The Food Channel website does not identify the entity conducting the business nor the business premises citedBlount Inc  v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR   at       FCA       IPR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe application before this

reverse or vary the Registrar s decision or direction   e  give any judgment  or make any order  that  in all the circumstances  it thinks fit   f  order a party to pay costs to another party  Section   of the Act is framed in broad terms  The terms of that enabling provision are directed to conferring broad powers of rehearing in the disposition of an appeal from the particular decision of the Registrar   Blount Inc  v Registrar of Trade Marks  supra  that is  admit further evidence  permit examination and cross examination of witnesses  permit an issue of fact to be tried as directed  affirm  reverse or vary the primary decision  give any judgment or make any order the Court thinks fit  and make an order as to costs  That which is to be reheard on the application  appeal  of FCN is whether FCN can make out  on all the evidence  its opposition to removal of the mark having failed to make out that position before the Registrar s delegate  The decision from which the appeal lies did not involve any element of security for costs  Nevertheless  s  e  of the Act confers broad power to      give any judgment  or make any order   that  in all the circumstances  it thinks fit on hearing an appeal against a decision or direction of the Registrar   emphasis added   The conferral of power upon the Court to make any order on hearing an appeal is sufficiently broad to confer a power to make any order in the course of an appeal proceeding including any interlocutory order  That power may extend in a given case to a security for costs order  In the ordinary course however  an applicant for security would find the source of the power for such an order in s   of the Court Act and Order   r   of the Federal Court Rules   The conferral of an express power on the Court to order security under the Trade Marks Act was probably not thought necessary having regard to the powers conferred upon the Court by the Court Act and the Federal Court Rules   In principle  the scope of s  e  is broad enough to confer power on the Court to make an order against any party in all the circumstances in any given case  if the relevant discretionary factors are satisfied  In this case  it is not necessary to consider any further the scope of the power particularly as it relates to a potential order that might be made against a respondent  if at all  as no order ought to be made in the exercise of discretion for these reasons  First  no claim for relief is made by the respondent other than to affirm the decision of the respondent s delegate challenged by the applicant by way of rehearing  Secondly  although the respondent initiated the proceeding before the Registrar and sought to remove the trade mark from the Register  the present applicant seeks the rehearing and could have put on before the Registrar all of the evidence that it now proposes to put on in the appeal  If all the evidence bearing on the question is as compelling as FCN contends  the Court proceeding and the attendant costs would not have been necessary  Thirdly  the applicant bore the rebuttal burden as a matter of law under s   of the Act before the Registrar in relation to any allegation made by TFN under s  b  of the Act and failed to put on all the evidence that might have discharged that burden  Fourthly  the evidence as to the amount of costs which might be the subject of an order is scant  Accordingly  FCN s application for security is to be dismissed  with costs   I certify that the preceding twenty seven   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein

http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIt is true that FCN has failed to identify assets of the company out of which an order for costs might be satisfied  However  on the evidence  FCN is a going concern  FCN has previously satisfied at least one order for costs in litigation between the same parties  The undertaking offered by Mr Lawrence is not decisive of TFN s application in the sense that the offer of the undertaking is determinative of a decision in the exercise of the discretion  It is one important factor to be taken into account  In Intercraft Cabinets Pty Ltd v Sampas Pty Ltd   HCA         ACLC   at p   Malcolm CJ put the principle in these terms    While the fact that those who stand behind the company have offered to guarantee payment of the taxed costs of the appellant is a material consideration  it is not the only consideration  There are other matters to be considered such as the merits of the action  the conduct of the parties and any other matter relevant to the exercise of the discretion  including the proposition that the mere impecuniosity of a plaintiff should not be a bar to the commencement of proceedings     emphasis added citedMantaray
