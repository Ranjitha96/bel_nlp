Watson v AWB Limited  No     FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAustralian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIt was also submitted on behalf of Mr Watson that the privilege against self incrimination has a role to play in related civil cases  In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mining Projects Group Ltd   FCA         FCR   at    p   Finkelstein J said      In the case of self incrimination privilege the defendant must establish that the provision of information or the production of documents in the civil case leads to a real and appreciable risk of a criminal prosecution before the privilege can be invoked  Rio Tinto Zinc Corporation v Westinghouse Electric Corporation   AC   at   Rank Film Distributors Ltd v Video Information Centre   AC   at   Sorby   CLR at      That will not be difficult to show when  as here  the proceeding is aimed at proving that the directors engaged in conduct which would establish  or go a long way toward establishing  that they had also committed criminal acts  I do not disagree with these statements of principle  It must  however  be remembered that the examinations which are recorded in the transcripts were conducted as part of an investigation undertaken by ASIC pursuant to s   and ss     of the ASIC Act  In examinations conducted as part of such an investigation  the ASIC inspector may require the examinee to answer a question that is put to the examinee at the examination which is relevant to a matter that ASIC is investigating  s    The examination is to take place in private  s   and a written record of the examination is to be created and kept  s    Under s   ASIC may  subject to such conditions as it may wish to impose  give to a person a copy of the written record of the examination citedHearne v Street   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlCounsel for the examinees have submitted that express undertakings should be required by the Court in the circumstances of the present case and that the precise terms upon which access is to be granted should be spelled out in order to avoid any future misunderstanding as to those terms  Counsel for the applicants resists the imposition of such a term on the basis that it is unnecessary  He referred me to passages in Hearne v Street   HCA         CLR   which make clear that the implied undertaking not to use documents produced under compulsion in litigation for any purpose other than the purposes of the litigation for which they were produced is a substantive obligation and need not be incorporated into an express undertaking  Whilst the submissions advanced on behalf of the applicants in this respect may well be correct  I do think that there is some advantage in articulating with precision the precise terms upon which access is to be granted  This is not out of any concern that the legal representatives in the present case would not both understand and respect their obligations under the implied undertaking  It is simply the best way to ensure that all persons to whom access is granted have a very clear understanding of the terms upon which that access is being granted  I prefer to impose a requirement that express undertakings be given  The parties are also in broad agreement that I should provide that notice be given to the examinees if the transcripts are intended to be deployed at the trial  I will accommodate such a term in the orders which I will make  Finally  there is a dispute between the applicants  on the one hand  and the respondent  on the other hand  as to whether or not any claims for legal professional privilege intended to be made by the respondent should be dealt with by way of affidavit or by letter in the first instance  Given the fact that the commencement of the trial is fast approaching  I think that the best course is for the applicants  proposal to be adopted  I will therefore incorporate the applicants  suggested orders in this respect in the orders which I will make  For all of the above reasons  I think that the interests of justice are best served by granting access to the transcripts to certain named legal representatives of the parties and to do so on strict terms as to confidentiality  I propose to make orders accordingly appliedR v Saleam   NSWCCA  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCCA  htmlMr Studdy SC focussed more upon matters of confidentiality and relevance  He submitted  correctly  I think  that the applicant for the subpoena must          identify a legitimate forensic purpose for which access is sought and establish that it is on the cards that the documents will materially assist his case       R v Saleam   NSWCCA   at   per Simpson J  Spigelman CJ and Studdert J agreeing   There was evidence before me which satisfied me that the contents of the transcripts were very likely to be at the heart of the subject matter of the case  Originally  Mr Studdy SC urged upon me that I should send off the transcripts to an independent barrister with a request  or perhaps subject to an order  that that barrister read all of the transcripts and come to a view by reference to the pleadings which particular questions and answers might have some conceivable relevance to the issues in the case as discerned by that barrister  He or she would then mask those portions of the transcript which were considered to be irrelevant  During the course of argument  I indicated to Mr Studdy SC that I saw many difficulties with that approach  In the end  notwithstanding that he did not abandon the suggestion  he did not press it as vigorously as he had at the outset  I am not prepared to engage some third party in the manner and for the purposes suggested by Mr Studdy SC  Mr Studdy SC then urged upon me that I should perform the task that he said the independent barrister should perform  I decline to take that course  It is unnecessary  In addition  the respondent objects to my looking at the transcripts  in any event  All Counsel focussed on questions of confidentiality  These matters are more appropriately dealt with when I come to consider the terms upon which access might be granted citedReid v Howard     CLR  Counsel for Michael Watson submitted that the privilege against self incrimination  of which the right to silence is part  is a fundamental bulwark of liberty which is deeply ingrained in the common law of Australia  In support of that submission  Counsel cited Reid v Howard     CLR    In Reid v Howard   CLR     former clients of a chartered accountant  having learned that he was misappropriating funds  applied for orders in the Supreme Court of New South Wales compelling him to disclose information about certain assets  The accountant claimed privilege against self incrimination  The Court of Appeal accepted the claim for privilege but made orders compelling disclosure upon conditions intended to protect the accountant from the risk of prosecution  The Crown was not a party to the making of the orders  The High Court held that there is no scope for an exception to privilege against self incrimination  in criminal or civil proceedings  other than by statute or waiver  At   CLR   Deane J said      Unless it appears that the assertion of potential incrimination is unsustainable  a claim to the benefit of the privilege cannot  in the absence of statutory warrant  properly be disregarded or overridden by the courts  In Reid v Howard   CLR at   the majority who delivered the joint judgment  Toohey  Gaudron  McHugh and Gummow JJ  said that the privilege against self incrimination was not simply a rule of evidence but was   a basic and substantive common law right    Their Honours went on to hold that there was no scope for an exception to the privilege other than by statute  at   CLR    In terms of principle  the ASIC Act has modified the privilege against self incrimination to some extent  As envisaged by the relevant statements of principle in Reid v Howard   CLR   the scope of the privilege has  to some extent  been modified by statute and that modification of the privilege is effective  However  the answers to the questions asked during the course of the relevant examinations which are recorded in the transcripts cannot be used in criminal proceedings other than as permitted by s   of the ASIC Act  This is not a case of a court in a civil proceeding seeking to override the privilege before the privilege can be invoked  The simple fact is that  to the extent permitted by law  the privilege in its modified form has already been invoked  For these reasons  I do not think that the examinees have made out their submission that access to the transcripts should be denied as a matter of law
