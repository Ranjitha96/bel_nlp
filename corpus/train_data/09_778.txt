Combis  Trustee of the Property of Peter Jensen  Bankrupt  v Jensen   FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedASIC v Rich   Rich   Fam LR  The Family Court may set aside financial agreements in the circumstances provided by s  K of the Family Law Act   Section  K was inserted by the Family Law Amendment Act    Cth  following the decision of the Family Court in ASIC v Rich   Rich   Fam LR   where O Ryan J found that the Family Court had no jurisdiction to set aside a binding financial agreement at the request of a third p arty  So far as relevant  s  K provides    Circumstances in which court may set aside a financial agreement or termination agreement       A court may make an order setting aside a financial agreement or a termination agreement if  and only if  the court is satisfied that             aa  a party to the agreement entered into the agreement       i  for the purpose  or for purposes that included the purpose  of defrauding or defeating a creditor or creditors of the party  or      ii  with reckless disregard of the interests of a creditor or creditors of the party  or I note that  so far as is relevant  the intentions required to be established in the context of s  K of the Family Law Act and s   of the Bankruptcy Act are different  Section  K of the Family Law Act allows the Court to set aside a financial agreement if a party to the agreement entered the agreement for the purpose or for purposes that included the purpose of defrauding or defeating a creditor or creditors of the party   whereas s   of the Bankruptcy Act provides that a transfer is void as against a trustee in bankruptcy if  inter alia   entered with the main purpose of preventing the transferred property from becoming divisible among the transferor s creditors or hindering or delaying the process of making property available for division among the transferor s creditors  To that extent the provisions of the Family Law Act contemplate broader grounds for intervention than the provisions of s   of the Bankruptcy Act   In these proceedings the applicant s case as pleaded in his statement of claim falls squarely within the terms of s  b  of the Bankruptcy Act   namely that the main purpose of the bankrupt in making the transfer was to prevent the Carrara property from becoming divisible among his creditors and to hinder or delay the process of making the Carrara property available for division among his creditors  Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Act    Cth In   both the Bankruptcy Act and the Family Law Act were

FCR    Second  in my view a more accurate articulation of the respondent s claim in these interlocutory proceedings is that the Federal Court lacks jurisdiction to deal with the applicant s claims  allegedly because the correct forum for the claim of the applicant is the Family Court  and because the applicant should have commenced proceedings pursuant to s  K of the Family Law Act in the Family Court  Clearly this Court has power to permanently stay or dismiss proceedings where the Court has no jurisdiction because of lack of power  absence of legislative grant of jurisdiction  or otherwise

litigation constitutes an abuse of process  unless of course the commencement of process for an improper purpose in the sense explained in Williams v Spautz   HCA         CLR   can also be identified  Absence of jurisdiction is commonly pleaded as an alternative to a claim for abuse of process  However even if I am wrong as to the basis of the respondent s claim in these interlocutory proceedings  the respondent has clearly contended that it was appropriate for the Court to permanently stay the substantive proceedings on the grounds that the proper course of the applicant in seeking to impugn the transfer of the Carrara property by Mr Jensen was to apply to the Family Court to have the entire financial agreement set aside pursuant to s  K aa  of the Family Law Act   For reasons to which I now turn  I do not agree citedDey v Victorian Railways Commissioners   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlHowever the courts do not easily reach this view as Dixon J observed in Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners   HCA         CLR   at     A case must be very clear indeed to justify the summary intervention of the court to prevent a plaintiff submitting his case for determination in the appointed manner by the court with or without a jury  The fact that a transaction is intricate may not disentitle the court to examine a cause of action alleged to grow out of it for the purpose of seeing whether the proceeding amounts to an abuse of process or is vexatious  But once it appears that there is a real question to be determined whether of fact or law and that the rights of the parties depend upon it  then it is not competent for the court to dismiss the action as frivolous and vexatious and an abuse of process  I shall return to O   r   later in this judgment  Legislative developments with respect to bankruptcy and family law issues Both parties have made detailed submissions as to the operation of the Bankruptcy Act and the Family Law Act   including amending legislation  The difficulties which can arise where family law issues and bankruptcy issues interact have been the subject of numerous attempts at legislative resolution  These difficulties have consistently flowed from the uncertainty and hardship for either or both the creditors and non bankrupt spouse arising from inconsistencies created between family law and bankruptcy law  cf para   Explanatory Memorandum  Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Bill    Section   and section   of the Bankruptcy Act Section   and s   of the Bankruptcy Act both provide for certain types of transaction to be subsequently declared void as against a trustee in bankruptcy  Section   applies to transfers occurring within five years prior to the commencement of bankruptcy at

of the respondent is as follows  The Carrara property was jointly owned by Mr Jensen and the respondent  The applicant makes no challenge to the financial arrangement of   January   nor is it pleaded that the financial agreement was not one to which Part VIIIA of the Family Law Act applies  or that the agreement failed to comply with requirements of the Family Law Act   In the absence of such a challenge it is not open to the applicant to have the transfer effected by Mr Jensen of his former half interest in the property declared void  By force of the financial agreement the respondent became equitable owner of the land  Under the Family Law Act   financial agreements can only be set aside by the Family Court under s  K   financial agreements can only be terminated by the parties pursuant to s  J   financial agreements have a special status by reason of the provisions of the Family Law Act   In Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Mateo   FCAFC         FCR   the Full Court of the Federal Court held that the effect of consent orders of the Family Court made under s   of the Family Law Act pursuant to which the Family Court ordered that the husband transfer his half interest in jointly owned land to the wife was that the Family Court orders themselves vested in the wife all of the husband s equitable estate in the land  The Full Court also held that the transfer by a person having a bare legal title perfected the title of the equitable owner of the property  was not a transfer of property within the meaning of s   of the Bankruptcy Act   The application by the Official Trustee should have been to the Family Court to set aside the orders under s  A of the Family Law Act   In these proceedings the critical divesting event with respect to the Carrara property was the financial agreement  which resulted in the equitable estate in the Carrara property passing to the respondent in January    The actual transfer  executed by Mr Jensen on   August   was of no significance because Mr Jensen had already divested himself of his interest in the property pursuant to the financial agreement  If the matter is dealt with by the Family Court  both the interests of the respondent and the creditors can be brought into account  The present proceedings are calculated to bring only the interests of creditors into play  If the transfer to the respondent of the interest in the matrimonial home is to be set aside  the whole matter will have to be reviewed  and that review can only occur in the Family Court  To hold otherwise runs contrary to Mateo   In Macks v Edge   FCA         FCR   Besanko J declined to transfer proceedings by a trustee under s   and s   of the Bankruptcy Act to the Family Court but primarily because of the lateness of the application  His Honour reached no conclusion as to any of the legal issues involved  The decision of Ryan J in Rambaldi  as Trustee of Bankrupt Estate of Volkov  v Volkov   FCA   is authority for the proposition that if a trustee in bankruptcy seeks to utilise s   of the Bankruptcy Act in the context of any existing financial agreement  the trustee needs to confront the financial agreement itself  The Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Act    Cth  amended the term  maintenance agreement  in the Bankruptcy Act to delete the term  financial agreement   This simply means that the automatic exemption of financial agreements from the operation of s   of the Bankruptcy Act was removed it does not have the effect of declaring that the fact that a transaction occurred in pursuance of a financial agreement ceases to have any relevance  Financial agreements continue to retain all the protection that the Family Law Act expressly or implicitly provides  The amendment does not envisage the circumvention of s  K of the Family Law Act by applications made with respect to  trust transfers   In any event  the exemption in favour of financial agreements only ever applied to claims made with respect to s   it never extended to claims under s    The applicant s case The facts in Macks v Edge   FCA         FCR   were more similar to those in contention before me  In that case a husband and wife entered an oral  separation agreement  by which the husband agreed to transfer his interest in property to the wife  The agreement was entered in or about September    On   May   the parties entered a written financial agreement giving effect to the oral agreement  A sequestration order against the estate of the husband was made on   July    The trustee in bankruptcy commenced an action in the Federal Court to have the transfers set aside on the basis that no or inadequate consideration was given by the wife for the transfer of the properties  and that the transfers were void within the provisions of s   or s   of the Bankruptcy Act   The wife issued proceedings in the Family Court against the trustee in bankruptcy and the husband seeking certain orders under the Family Law Act   including a declaration that the financial agreement and transfers were valid and binding  or  in the alternative  if the transfers were void  an order pursuant to s  K b  and  c  of the Family Law Act terminating the financial agreement and such order as was just and equitable pursuant to s  K  preserving the rights of the wife in relation to the property the subject of the terminated binding financial agreement  Besanko J considered in some detail historical legislative developments  including amendments to s   of the Family Law Act   the accretion of jurisdiction to the Family Court in relation to bankruptcy matters in terms of s   of the Bankruptcy Act   and the enactment of s  A of the Bankruptcy Act which empowered the Federal Court to transfer matters to the Family Court  However as his Honour continued    At the same time  there is nothing to suggest that this Court does not have jurisdiction over the trustee s claim and I reject the submission that the trustee has issued proceedings in the wrong court  The Family Court has jurisdiction to alter the trustee s rights with respect to vested bankruptcy property  but this Court retains jurisdiction to determine the prior questions of whether the transfers are void because they fall within the provisions of s   or s                It follows from what I have said that the first issue in proceedings between the Trustee and Mrs Edge is whether the trustee s claim under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act ought to be upheld  If the trustee is successful then Mrs Edge may make an application against the trustee under s   of the Family Law Act   with respect to the freehold property  leasehold property and speedboat  seeking an order  altering the interests of the bankruptcy trustee in the vested bankruptcy property   It seems to me that that is the substance of any proceedings she may bring in the Family Court  Her claim is in a sense a contingent claim in that it only becomes relevant if the trustee s claim is successful  If the trustee is unsuccessful then Mrs Edge s claim falls away because there is no relevant vested bankruptcy property  Should the trustee be successful  the Family Court has the power to alter the interests of the trustee in the vested bankruptcy property      In those circumstances  whether the order for transfer should be made comes down to whether it is appropriate in the exercise of the discretion to make the order for transfer  This Court can hear and determine the trustee s claim  but it cannot hear and determine Mrs Edge s claim should it become necessary to do so  If I make the order for transfer  the Family Court can hear and determine both claims  That is a powerful reason for making an order for transfer  On the other hand  the proceedings in this Court are nearly ready for hearing and  so far as I can see  involve some fairly concise issues  The hearing of the trustee s claim should not take very long  If the trustee s claim is unsuccessful  there will be no need for Mrs Edge to pursue the claim against the trustee in the Family Court  On balance  I am of the opinion that the proceedings should not be transferred to the Family Court   at    I do not accept Mr Griffin QC s interpretation of the decision in Mateo as submitted namely that if the financial agreement and the transfer are separated  the second part of the transaction is not a  transaction  within the meaning of s   and s   of the Bankruptcy Act because the relevant estate has already been transferred by force of the financial agreement  cf TS p   ll      Rather  as submitted by Mr McQuade  I consider the correct approach to be that in considering an application under s   and s   of the Bankruptcy Act   the Court considers the creation or transfer of the interest which is sought to be avoided  not the provision in the legal document  or other mechanism  which has created it  To illustrate this principle I need look no further than Rambaldi   FCA    The respondent in these proceedings claimed that Rambaldi   FCA   is authority that an applicant seeking to set aside a transaction pursuant to a financial agreement needs to  confront the financial agreement itself   However the clear outcome in Rambaldi   FCA   was that the Court set aside the purported equitable interest in the relevant property sought to be created by the financial agreement  not the financial agreement itself  cf   FCA   para    While the terms of the financial agreement in Rambaldi   FCA   were clearly critical to the questions whether the relevant provisions of the Bankruptcy Act were satisfied and accordingly whether the interest of the non bankrupt spouse should be set aside  the orders of the Court in Rambaldi   FCA   with respect to the financial agreement were limited to the validity of the creation of an interest in land purportedly created by the financial agreement  This outcome did not require an order that the financial agreement be avoided pursuant to s   or s    I consider that similar principles apply in the case before me  Whether the  transfer  in this case was the creation of an equitable interest in the Carrara property in favour of the respondent  or the actual transfer effected by the form    an issue I need not resolve for the purposes of this notice of motion  the transfer can nonetheless be the subject of challenge pursuant to s   or s   of the Bankruptcy Act without the applicant being required to make application to set aside the financial agreement executed by Mr Jensen and the respondent  I consider that this approach is consistent with the findings of this Court in Macks v Edge   FCA         FCR   and Rambaldi   FCA     as well as the Full Court in Mateo   FCAFC         FCR    In summary  I do not take the view that the Federal Court  in which the applicant commenced substantive proceedings  is the  wrong court  in this case  for the same reasons as those given by Besanko J in Macks v Edge namely that the Family Court has jurisdiction to alter the trustee s rights with respect to vested bankruptcy property  but this Court retains jurisdiction to determine the prior question of whether the transfer pursuant to the financial agreement was void because it falls within the provisions of s   or s   of the Bankruptcy Act   Macks v Edge   FCA         FCR   at    This approach is echoed in observations of Wilcox J in Mateo   FCAFC         FCR    at      It is not necessary for the applicant to apply to the Family Court to have the financial agreement between Mr Jensen and the respondent terminated as a necessary element of an application to have the transfer of the Carrara property set aside pursuant to s   and s   of the Bankruptcy Act  citedMateo v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlAt first instance  Tamberlin J set aside the notice   Mateo v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy   FCA         FCR    For the purposes of s     his Honour held that the  transfer  in this case consisted of the whole transaction ranging from the signing of the consent orders through to the completion of the transfer of the interest by the husband  Further  full faith and credit must be given to the orders of the Family Court unless they are set aside  In relation to s     the main purpose of the Family Court orders was to resolve outstanding matrimonial issues  The respondent points to the decision of the Full Court in Mateo   FCAFC         FCR   as authority for the proposition that  in the context of an application by a trustee in bankruptcy under s     the  transfer  consists of the whole transaction ranging from the signing of the consent orders  or in this case  the execution of the financial agreement  through to the completion of the transfer of the interest by the husband  and that accordingly it is not possible for this Court to make a determination as to the transfer of the Carrara property without disturbing the financial agreement as a whole  However to the extent that this was the finding of the judge at first instance in Mateo  see in particular Mateo v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy   FCA         FCR   at   the Full Court were by no means supportive of this proposition  see for example Wilcox J at   Branson J at    Indeed as Wilcox J observed at      Tamberlin J at first instance took the view that  it was artificial to  isolate one individual component of the transaction as in itself comprising the transfer  rather than to  look at the overall transaction which has been implemented   He found support for this approach in Silvera v Savic  citedMentyn v Westpac Banking Corporation   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlSecond  in my view a more accurate articulation of the respondent s claim in these interlocutory proceedings is that the Federal Court lacks jurisdiction to deal with the applicant s claims  allegedly because the correct forum for the claim of the applicant is the Family Court  and because the applicant should have commenced proceedings pursuant to s  K of the Family Law Act in the Family Court  Clearly this Court has power to permanently stay or dismiss proceedings where the Court has no jurisdiction because of lack of power  absence of legislative grant of jurisdiction  or otherwise   Rahman v

 FCA     Coffey v Secretary  Department of Social Security   FCA         FCR    A claim by a litigant that the court has no jurisdiction is however distinguishable from a claim that the litigation constitutes an abuse of process  unless of course the commencement of process for an improper purpose in the sense explained in Williams v Spautz   HCA         CLR   can also be identified  Absence of jurisdiction is commonly pleaded as an alternative to a claim for abuse of process  However even if I am wrong as to the basis of the respondent s claim in these interlocutory proceedings  the respondent has clearly contended that it was appropriate for the Court to permanently stay the substantive proceedings on the grounds that the proper course of the applicant in seeking to impugn the transfer of the Carrara property by Mr Jensen was to apply to the Family Court to have the entire financial agreement set aside pursuant to s  K aa  of the Family Law Act   For reasons to which I now

trustee in bankruptcy of the estate of a husband sought orders in the Federal Court setting aside the transfer of property from the husband to the wife prior to the husband s bankruptcy  The husband and wife had entered into a financial agreement which acknowledged the desire of the parties to make provisions to  recognise existing equitable interests  in those real properties  The Court found that the husband had held certain property on a constructive trust for the sole benefit of the wife prior to execution of the financial agreement  In relation to other property in relation to which the financial agreement purported to create and transfer to the wife an equitable interest  the Court considered the application of s   and s   of the Bankruptcy Act   Although Ryan J analysed the position prior to the   amendments to both the Bankruptcy Act and the Family Law Act   for reasons I explain later in this judgment I consider that the reasoning in Rambaldi   FCA   in respect of the application of s   is useful in these proceedings  Specifically  his Honour found that  an equitable interest in the relevant property arose only following execution of the financial agreement between the parties pursuant to s  C of the Family Law Act   section   and s   of the Bankruptcy Act were relevant  the financial agreement  as a maintenance agreement  was prima facie entitled to the protection against invalidity afforded to it by s   of the Bankruptcy Act   however that protection was subject to s   of the Bankruptcy Act   the financial agreement clearly effected a transfer  by a person who later became a bankrupt  of property to the non bankrupt spouse  The main purpose of the bankrupt in entering into the financial agreement was to prevent the property becoming divisible among his creditors or to delay the process of making it available for division among his creditors  the non bankrupt spouse provided no consideration for the transfer in the sense identified in Official Trustee v Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR     and the only consideration provided by the non bankrupt spouse was the entry into the financial agreement  however because of the application of s

of the interest in the matrimonial home is to be set aside  the whole matter will have to be reviewed  and that review can only occur in the Family Court  To hold otherwise runs contrary to Mateo   In Macks v Edge   FCA         FCR   Besanko J declined to transfer proceedings by a trustee under s   and s   of the Bankruptcy Act to the Family Court but primarily because of the lateness of the application  His Honour reached no conclusion as to any of the legal issues involved  The decision of Ryan J in Rambaldi  as Trustee of Bankrupt Estate of Volkov  v Volkov   FCA   is authority for the proposition that if a trustee in bankruptcy seeks to utilise s   of the Bankruptcy Act in the context of any existing financial agreement  the trustee needs to confront the financial agreement itself  The Bankruptcy and Family Law Legislation Amendment Act    Cth  amended the term  maintenance agreement  in the Bankruptcy Act to delete the term  financial agreement   This simply means that the automatic exemption of financial agreements from the operation of s   of the Bankruptcy Act was removed it does not have the effect of declaring that the fact that a transaction occurred in pursuance of a financial agreement ceases to have any relevance  Financial agreements continue to retain all the protection that the Family Law Act expressly or implicitly provides  The amendment does not envisage the circumvention of s  K of the Family Law Act by applications made with respect to  trust transfers   In any event  the exemption in favour of financial agreements only ever applied to claims made with respect to s   it never extended to claims under s    The applicant s case In Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Mateo   FCAFC         FCR   a husband and wife jointly owned land which had been their matrimonial home  They separated and applied to the Family Court for consent orders in relation to that property  The Family Court ordered the husband to transfer to the wife his interest in the property  and the wife to pay money to the husband  The husband executed a transfer of his interest in the property to the wife  and later became bankrupt  The Official Trustee  as trustee in bankruptcy of the husband  issued a notice requiring the wife to pay the value of the husband s interest in the property or to transfer to the Official Trustee a half interest in the land  on the basis that the transfer by the husband was void as against the Official Trustee pursuant to both s   and s   of the Bankruptcy Act   The Full Court dismissed an appeal by the Official Trustee  although for reasons other than given by the trial judge  The judges acknowledged that  in addition to unsecured creditors  the wife and children of the bankrupt had an interest in his estate  However the key reason for the decision of the Full Court in Mateo   FCAFC         FCR   was the fact that orders had been made by the Family Court  and a transfer was made by the husband who eventually became bankrupt pursuant to such orders  Wilcox J at   Branson J at     Merkel J at    Accordingly  the transfer of the husband s interest in the matrimonial home had not been  by a person who later becomes a bankrupt  for the purposes of s   and s    No order was made either at first instance or on appeal for the matter to be transferred to the Family Court  The respondent points to the decision of the Full Court in Mateo   FCAFC         FCR   as authority for the proposition that  in the context of an application by a trustee in bankruptcy under s     the  transfer  consists of the whole transaction ranging from the signing of the consent orders  or in this case  the execution of the financial agreement  through to the completion of the transfer of the interest by the husband  and that accordingly it is not possible for this Court to make a determination as to the transfer of the Carrara property without disturbing the financial agreement as a whole  However to the extent that this was the finding of the judge at first instance in Mateo  see in particular Mateo v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy   FCA         FCR   at   the Full Court were by no means supportive of this proposition  see for example Wilcox J at   Branson J at    Indeed as Wilcox J observed at      Tamberlin J at first instance took the view that  it was artificial to  isolate one individual component of the transaction as in itself comprising the transfer  rather than to  look at the overall transaction which has been implemented   He found support for this approach in Silvera v Savic   I do not accept Mr Griffin QC s interpretation of the decision in Mateo as submitted namely that if the financial agreement and the transfer are separated  the second part of the transaction is not a  transaction  within the meaning of s   and s   of the Bankruptcy Act because the relevant estate has already been transferred by force of the financial agreement  cf TS p   ll      Rather  as submitted by Mr McQuade  I consider the correct approach to be that in considering an application under s   and s   of the Bankruptcy Act   the Court considers the creation or transfer of the interest which is sought to be avoided  not the provision in the legal document  or other mechanism  which has created it  To illustrate this principle I need look no further than Rambaldi   FCA    The respondent in these proceedings claimed that Rambaldi   FCA   is authority that an applicant seeking to set aside a transaction pursuant to a financial agreement needs to  confront the financial agreement itself   However the clear outcome in Rambaldi   FCA   was that the Court set aside the purported equitable interest in the relevant property sought to be created by the financial agreement  not the financial agreement itself  cf   FCA   para    While the terms of the financial agreement in Rambaldi   FCA   were clearly critical to the questions whether the relevant provisions of the Bankruptcy Act were satisfied and accordingly whether the interest of the non bankrupt spouse should be set aside  the orders of the Court in Rambaldi   FCA   with respect to the financial agreement were limited to the validity of the creation of an interest in land purportedly created by the financial agreement  This outcome did not require an order that the financial agreement be avoided pursuant to s   or s    I consider that similar principles apply in the case before me  Whether the  transfer  in this case was the creation of an equitable interest in the Carrara property in favour of the respondent  or the actual transfer effected by the form    an issue I need not resolve for the purposes of this notice of motion  the transfer can nonetheless be the subject of challenge pursuant to s   or s   of the Bankruptcy Act without the applicant being required to make application to set aside the financial agreement executed by Mr Jensen and the respondent  I consider that this approach is consistent with the findings of this Court in Macks v Edge   FCA         FCR   and Rambaldi   FCA     as well as the Full Court in Mateo   FCAFC         FCR    In any event  as I have already observed  the key principle in my view emerging from the decision in Mateo   FCAFC         FCR   is that where property is transferred pursuant to orders of the Family Court and accordingly  the transfer of property is not  a transfer of property by a person who later becomes a bankrupt  for the purposes of s   and s   of the Bankruptcy Act the appropriate remedy of a trustee in bankruptcy seeking to have those orders set aside is to make application to the Family Court for variation of those orders  per Wilcox J at   Branson J at   Merkel J at    The facts in Mateo   FCAFC         FCR   are clearly distinguishable from the case before me in these proceedings the Carrara property was not transferred pursuant to orders of the Family Court  but pursuant to a financial agreement under the Family Law Act  which is very different from orders made by a superior court   Further  in my view the current legislative framework applicable to financial agreements contemplates that a trustee in bankruptcy may make application pursuant to both s   and s   of the Bankruptcy Act in the Federal Court to set aside a transfer pursuant to a financial agreement executed by the parties  In relation to the trustee s application pursuant to s   of the Bankruptcy Act in the instant proceedings  it is clear that The inference necessarily drawn as a result is that the legislature intended that a transaction pursuant to a financial agreement would not be protected in circumstances where subsequently a trustee in bankruptcy of a party to such an agreement seeks to have transactions set aside pursuant to s   of the Bankruptcy Act   This is notwithstanding the operation of s  G of the Family Law Act   which provides that financial agreements are binding on the parties thereto without the necessity for an order of the Family Court  In summary  I do not take the view that the Federal Court  in which the applicant commenced substantive proceedings  is the  wrong court  in this case  for the same reasons as those given by Besanko J in Macks v Edge namely that the Family Court has jurisdiction to alter the trustee s rights with respect to vested bankruptcy property  but this Court retains jurisdiction to determine the prior question of whether the transfer pursuant to the financial agreement was void because it falls within the provisions of s   or s   of the Bankruptcy Act   Macks v Edge   FCA         FCR   at    This approach is echoed in observations of Wilcox J in Mateo   FCAFC         FCR    at      It is not necessary for the applicant to apply to the Family Court to have the financial agreement between Mr Jensen and the respondent terminated as a necessary element of an application to have the transfer of the Carrara property set aside pursuant to s   and s   of the Bankruptcy Act  citedRahman v Director General Department of Education   Training   NSWCA  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  htmlSecond  in my view a more accurate articulation of the respondent s claim in these interlocutory proceedings is that the Federal Court lacks jurisdiction to deal with the applicant s claims  allegedly because the correct forum for the claim of the applicant is the Family Court  and because the applicant should have commenced proceedings pursuant to s  K of the Family Law Act in the Family Court  Clearly this Court has power to permanently stay or dismiss proceedings where the Court has no jurisdiction because of lack of power  absence of legislative grant of jurisdiction  or otherwise   Rahman v Director General Department of Education   Training   NSWCA     Ramsay v Accident Compensation Corporation   NZCA     Simundic v University of Newcastle   FCA     Mentyn v Westpac Banking Corporation   FCA     Coffey v Secretary  Department of Social Security   FCA         FCR    A claim by a litigant that the court has no jurisdiction is however distinguishable from a claim that the litigation constitutes an abuse of process  unless of course the commencement of process for an improper purpose in the sense explained in Williams v Spautz   HCA         CLR   can also be identified  Absence of jurisdiction is commonly pleaded as an alternative to a claim for abuse of process  However even if I am wrong as to the basis of the respondent s claim in these interlocutory proceedings  the respondent has clearly contended that it was appropriate for the Court to permanently stay the substantive proceedings on the grounds that the proper course of the applicant in seeking to impugn the transfer of the Carrara property by Mr Jensen was to apply to the Family Court to have the entire financial agreement set aside pursuant to s  K aa  of the Family Law Act   For reasons to which I now turn  I do not agree followedRambaldi  as Trustee of Bankrupt Estate of Volkov  v Volkov   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn summary the case of the respondent is as follows  The Carrara property was jointly owned by Mr Jensen and the respondent  The applicant makes no challenge to the financial arrangement of   January   nor is it pleaded that the financial agreement was not one to which Part VIIIA of the Family Law Act applies  or that the agreement failed to comply with requirements of the Family Law Act   In the absence of such a challenge it is not open to the applicant to have the transfer effected by Mr Jensen of his former half interest in the property declared void  By force of the financial agreement the respondent became equitable owner of the land  Under the Family Law Act   financial agreements can only be set aside by the Family Court under s  K   financial agreements can only be terminated by the parties pursuant to s  J   financial agreements have a special status by reason of the provisions of the Family Law Act   In Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Mateo   FCAFC         FCR   the Full Court of the Federal Court held that the effect of consent orders of the Family Court made under s   of the Family Law Act pursuant to which the Family Court ordered that the husband transfer his half interest in jointly owned land to the wife was that the Family Court orders themselves vested in the wife all of the husband s equitable estate in the land  The Full Court also held that the transfer by a person having a bare legal title perfected the title of the equitable owner of the property  was not a transfer of property within the meaning of s   of the Bankruptcy Act   The application by the Official Trustee should have been to the Family Court to set aside the orders under s  A of the Family Law Act   In these proceedings the critical divesting event with respect to the Carrara property was the financial agreement  which resulted in the equitable estate in the Carrara property passing to the respondent in January    The actual transfer  executed by Mr Jensen on   August   was of no significance because Mr Jensen had already divested himself of his interest in the property pursuant to the financial agreement  If the matter is dealt with by the Family Court  both the interests of the respondent and the creditors can be brought into account  The present proceedings are calculated to bring only the interests of creditors into play  If the transfer to the respondent of the interest in the matrimonial home is to be set aside  the whole matter will have to be reviewed  and that review can only occur in the Family Court  To hold otherwise runs contrary to Mateo   In Macks v Edge   FCA         FCR   Besanko J declined to transfer

applications made with respect to  trust transfers   In any event  the exemption in favour of financial agreements only ever applied to claims made with respect to s   it never extended to claims under s    The applicant s case More recently in Rambaldi  as Trustee of Bankrupt Estate of Volkov  v Volkov   FCA   a trustee in bankruptcy of the estate of a husband sought orders in the Federal Court setting aside the transfer of property from the husband to the wife prior to the husband s bankruptcy  The husband and wife had entered into a financial agreement which acknowledged the desire of the parties to make provisions to  recognise existing equitable interests  in those real properties  The Court found that the husband had held certain property on a constructive trust for the sole benefit of the wife prior to execution of the financial agreement  In relation to other property in relation to which the financial agreement purported to create and transfer to the wife an equitable interest  the Court considered the application of s   and s   of the Bankruptcy Act   Although Ryan J analysed the position prior to the   amendments to both the Bankruptcy Act and the Family Law Act   for reasons I explain later in this judgment I consider that the reasoning in Rambaldi   FCA   in respect of the application of s   is useful in these proceedings  Specifically  his Honour found that  an equitable interest in the relevant property arose only following execution of the financial agreement between the parties pursuant to s  C of the Family Law Act   section   and s   of the Bankruptcy Act were relevant  the financial agreement  as a maintenance agreement  was prima facie entitled to the protection against invalidity afforded to it by s   of the Bankruptcy Act   however that protection was subject to s   of the Bankruptcy Act   the financial agreement clearly effected a transfer  by a person who later became a bankrupt  of property to the non bankrupt spouse  The main purpose of the bankrupt in entering into the financial agreement was to prevent the property becoming divisible among his creditors or to delay the process of making it available for division among his creditors  the non bankrupt spouse provided no consideration for the transfer in the sense identified in Official Trustee v Lopatinsky   FCAFC         FCR     and the only consideration provided by the non bankrupt spouse was the entry into the financial agreement  however because of the application of s   this was of no value for the purposes of s   of the Bankruptcy Act   Findings I do not accept Mr Griffin QC s interpretation of the decision in Mateo as submitted namely that if the financial agreement and the transfer are separated  the second part of the transaction is not a

clear in relation to s   of the Bankruptcy Act   Unlike s     s   makes no mention of maintenance agreements  or financial agreements   As I have already observed in this judgment  s   specifically provides that subject to s     nothing in the Bankruptcy Act invalidates  inter alia   a transfer made by the debtor before bankruptcy pursuant to a maintenance agreement  It therefore follows that a transfer of property pursuant to a maintenance agreement by a debtor who subsequently became bankrupt could be challenged by a trustee in bankruptcy pursuant to s    As I have also noted in relation to s     s   of the Bankruptcy Act now excludes financial agreements from the definition of maintenance agreement  This is a curious outcome  the reason for which is not clear  In my view a reasonable and logical explanation is that submitted by Mr McQuade for the applicant  namely that in the absence of a specific exemption for transactions undertaken pursuant to a financial agreement  such transactions are capable of being the subject of application by the trustee in bankruptcy of the transferor pursuant to s   of the Bankruptcy Act   Indeed this was the position prior to the   amendments and in this respect there is  as I indicated earlier  particular relevance to the decision of Ryan J in Rambaldi   FCA     where his Honour accepted that a trustee in bankruptcy could apply pursuant to s   of the Bankruptcy Act to set aside an interest in real property following a financial agreement between parties to a marriage   Another possible explanation  namely that the effect of the   amendments to the Bankruptcy Act resulted in financial agreements being excluded from the operation of s     in my view is completely anomalous and has no merit   ConclusioncitedRamsay v

advantage  nor how the proceedings are being used by the applicant to obtain some advantage for which they were not designed  In support of her claim of abuse of process  the respondent contends in
