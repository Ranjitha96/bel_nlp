SBRF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlaffirmedSBRF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  This is set out conveniently in   to   of the decision of the Federal Magistrate whose orders are the subject of the present appeal  SBRF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FMCA    The following is an adaptation of those paragraphs  I should indicate at the outset that the Tribunal has made three decisions in relation to review applications of the appellant  Though it is technically inaccurate  I will for ease in exposition differentiate between what I will call the  first Tribunal   the second Tribunal  and the  third Tribunal    The Tribunal decision  the subject of the present judicial review proceedings  is in fact the third decision of the Tribunal in relation to the appellant  The first review was conducted in    The appellant was unsuccessful  both before the delegate of the Minister and before the Tribunal at that time and for reasons of lack of credibility in each instance  In the claim advanced by the appellant in   he and his wife used false identities  His claimed entitlement to a protection visa and to refugee status under the Refugee Convention arose from a fear of his being persecuted by Serbs  arising out of what he said was his forced conscription into the Kosovo Liberation Army   Notwithstanding the lack of success of their application  in   the Minister exercised his discretion under s   of the Act and provided the appellant and his wife with three year protection visas on humanitarian grounds citedSTCB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Tribunal noted that the appellant s brother had succeeded on a similar claim  The appellant s brother s claim had been made prior to the amendment of s  S of the Act that was effected by the Migration Legislation Amendment Act  No      Cth    The effect of these amendments is described in the decision of the High Court in STCB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR     The Tribunal went on to say  Even if I were satisfied which I am not that the applicant s family were involved in such a feud  the applicant s claims amount to a claim to fear persecution for reason of membership of a particular social group  namely his family  In considering such a claim  s  S of the Migration Act would be relevant and  in interpreting that provision  I would be bound by the terms and reasons of the High Court s decision in STCB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA       Following that decision and applying s  S a    it is clear that the applicant s cousin  Martin s fear of persecution would be for a reason other than those mentioned in Art  A  of the Convention namely revenge for murder  Section  S a  would then require that fear of persecution to be disregarded  Section  S b i  would then require the applicant s fear of persecution to be disregarded  since it would be reasonable to conclude that that fear would not exist if his cousin s fear had never existed  And s  S b ii  would require that his father s and brother s fear of persecution be disregarded  since it would be reasonable to conclude that neither of those fears would exist either if the cousin s fear had never existed  The result of disregarding the fears of persecution of the cousin  the applicant  the father and the brother would then be that the applicant would be treated as not having a well founded fear of persecution for the reason of membership of a particular social group that consists of the  sic  his family   It is necessary to refer only to two provisions of the Act  s  S and s    Section  S provides  For the purposes of the application of this Act and the regulations to a particular person  the first person  in determining whether the first person has a well founded fear of being persecuted for the reason of membership of a particular social group that consists of the first person s family       a  disregard any fear of persecution  or any persecution  that any other member or former member  whether alive or dead  of the family has ever experienced  where the reason for the fear or persecution is not a reason mentioned in Article  A  of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol  and      b  disregard any fear of persecution  or any persecution  that     i  the first person has ever experienced  or             ii  any other member or former member  whether alive or dead  of the family has ever experienced              where it is reasonable to conclude that the fear or persecution would not exist if it were assumed that the fear or persecution mentioned in paragraph  a  had never existed   As the decision of the High Court in STCB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs illustrates  this provision has an inexorable operation to fears of persecution based on family membership in the usual blood feud case   Section   provides  The Tribunal must invite the applicant to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review citedSZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html     As the High Court indicated in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR   at   to         The Act defines the nature of the opportunity to be heard that is to be given to an applicant for review by the Tribunal  The applicant is to be invited  to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review    The reference to  the issues arising in relation to the decision under review  is important        Those issues will not be sufficiently identified in every case by describing them simply as whether the applicant is entitled to a protection visa  The statutory language  arising in relation to the decision under review  is more particular  The issues arising in relation to a decision under review are to be identified having regard not only to the fact that the Tribunal may exercise     all the powers and discretions conferred by the Act on the original decision maker  here  the minister s delegate  but also to the fact that the Tribunal is to review that particular decision  for which the decision maker will have given reasons       The Tribunal is not confined to whatever may have been the issues that the delegate considered  The issues that arise in relation to the decision are to be identified by the Tribunal  But     unless some other additional issues are identified by the Tribunal  as they may be  it would ordinarily follow that  on review by the Tribunal  the issues arising in relation to the decision under review would be those which the original decision maker identified as determinative against the applicant             Emphasis in original   As I have already noted  the particular decision that was under review by the third Tribunal was the decision of the second delegate who said that he found the appellant was not credible in those claims originally advanced under his false identity and that he made no claims in relation to fear of persecution in Albania under his actual name  To reiterate the Albanian blood feud claims were only raised for the first time before the second Tribunal whose decision was quashed by Brown FM   There has been recent discussion and some level of disagreement between judges of this Court on the operation of s   where a Tribunal decision is quashed and the matter remitted to the Tribunal  whether or not constituted by the same member  for determination  For present purposes I would merely note the following citedSZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     FCR    i  Until the Tribunal makes a valid decision on the review that has been initiated by a valid application under s   it has a duty to perform that particular review  SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     FCR   at      iii  When a decision on a

iv  As was said by the Full Court in SZEPZ at   An invalid decision by the Tribunal is no decision at all but it does not follow that all steps and procedures taken in arriving at that invalid decision are themselves invalid  The Tribunal still has before it the materials that were obtained when the decision that had been set aside was made   To the extent that Cowdroy J is properly to be taken as suggesting to the contrary in SZHLM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA         ALD   at     his Honour s view ought not be followed in my view    v  As it is the Tribunal which continues to conduct the particular review consequent upon a remitter  the steps taken by the Tribunal to discharge its statutory obligations under s  A and s   in the conduct of that review prior to
