Oceania Pty Ltd  Administrators Appointed    FCA     ATPR    http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In this proceeding the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission  the ACCC  sought various remedies against the second respondent  Mr Carney  for contraventions of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   the Act   The relief sought included declarations that Mr Carney had knowingly been concerned in contraventions of ss   and   of the Act and the imposition of pecuniary penalties for contraventions of those provisions  The ACCC alleged that Mr Carney was a person knowingly concerned in contraventions of the Act by the first respondent of which he was  at relevant times  the Managing Director  The proceeding  in so far as it involved the first respondent  was dealt with by Heerey J  see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Fila Sport Oceania Pty Ltd  Administrators Appointed    FCA       ATPR      The circumstances in which the contraventions by the first respondent occurred  and in which it was alleged Mr Carney was knowingly concerned  are explained in his Honour s reasons at   to   and need not be repeated here  Suffice to say the contraventions were serious  They related to the marketing of sporting products to supporters of Australian Football League clubs and involved attempts by the first respondent  which were to a significant extent successful  to exclude competitor s products from retail outlets  The ACCC discontinued the proceeding against the third respondent and he gave evidence against Mr Carney   The trial of the proceeding between the ACCC and Mr Carney commenced on   August   and was estimated at that time to take three weeks  Mr Carney represented himself and cross examined each of the witnesses who was called by the ACCC  On   September   at the end of the three week period allotted for the trial  only about half of the ACCC s witnesses had given evidence  It was estimated that up to a further five weeks would be necessary to complete the hearing  The further hearing of the proceeding was adjourned until   November    Before the trial was adjourned the parties had agreed to the suggestion that the matter be referred for mediation by a Court appointed mediator  When the hearing resumed on   November   the parties announced that the mediation had been successful and invited the Court to make a declaration and orders in accordance with agreed minutes  Those minutes read   THE COURT DECLARES THAT           Between September or October   and November   the second respondent was a person involved in a contravention by the first respondent of section   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth       THE COURT ORDERS THAT           The second respondent pay to the Commonwealth a pecuniary penalty pursuant to section   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in respect of his conduct referred to in paragraph   above  in the amount of   by four yearly instalments of   each  the first such instalment payable on or before   June   and the second  third and fourth instalments payable on or before   June     June   and   June   respectively  provided that if the second respondent defaults in any payment and the default continues for one month after written notice of the default  the total outstanding balance shall become immediately due and payable    The applicant and the second respondent bear their own costs of and incidental to the proceeding against the second respondent referred toCommerce Commission v New Zealand Milk Corporation Ltd     NZLR    The proceeding against the second respondent be otherwise dismissed       Having heard submissions I made the declaration and orders sought and indicated that I would publish my reasons at a later date  These are those reasons     The Court is not
