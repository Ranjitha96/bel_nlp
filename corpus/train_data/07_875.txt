Paramasivam v University of New South Wales   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedBaird v State of Queensland   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  I have carefully considered the evidence of the applicant  and it does not  even at its highest  provide any support for the view that she has been treated unlawfully because of race  colour or ethnicity  To the contrary  the evidence supports the conclusion that there was no causal relationship between the removal of the applicant from the University s premises and any contravention of her human rights or unlawful deprivation of equal opportunity  There must be a connection between the impugned act and the prohibited ground as opposed to a mere belief that there has been a discriminatory course of conduct  and when ascertaining whether this connection exists  a broad interpretation of s   of the Act should be preferred  see Baird v State of Queensland   FCAFC         FCR   at    In the present case  the applicant is of the belief that she has been unlawfully discriminated against in the basis of her race or ethnicity  The evidence before the court does not establish the necessary basis for forming a view that a causal relationship existed  For these reasons  I am satisfied that there is sufficient substance in the submissions made for the University to warrant summary judgment being entered in its favour   It is not necessary for me to deal with the other prayers contained in the University s notice of motion as they were all posited in the alternative  However  I will briefly state my position on two of the other prayers   First  I would grant prayer five in the notice  which seeks a stay in this proceeding until the applicant provides security for costs  Given the lengthy history of the matter  the cumbersome detail of the affidavits filed to date  and the period over which the proceedings will be heard  it would be reasonable and appropriate for the proceedings to be stayed until the applicant provides security for costs in the amount of    In the circumstances  this figure  which was proposed by the University  would be extremely modest  Accordingly  even if I was convinced that there was some reasonable prospect of success in this present application  I would still consider that the proceedings should be stayed until security for costs had been given citedBoston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Australasia Pty Ltd     IPR   Section  A  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  empowers the Court to give summary judgment against an applicant if it is satisfied that the applicant has  no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding   This is a less onerous test than that previously stated and applied in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways  NSW    HCA         CLR   at   namely that the allegations are  so clearly untenable that  they  cannot possibly succeed   Section  A was designed to make it easier for an opposing party to strike out a claim or defence  see Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Australasia Pty Ltd     IPR   at   Duncan v Lipscombe Charles Care Service Inc   FCA   at     Of course it is essential that the Court must be careful not to do an injustice by summarily dismissing proceedings  or denying an applicant an opportunity to ventilate their case  However  in the present case  the material placed before the Court is not sufficient to satisfy the threshold raised by s  A  because it does not raise a reasonable argument to the effect that there has been a contravention of the Act   The version of the evidence for which the applicant contends merely indicates a reference to the applicant s colour of skin or ethnic origin as a way of identifying her for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of the Inclosed Lands Protection Act    NSW  a piece of legislation which applies equally to people of any ethnic origin  Merely to identify a person by reference to characteristics of clothing  ethnicity or skin for the purpose of the application and enforcement of a generally applicable
