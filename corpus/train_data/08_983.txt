Victorian Women Lawyers  Association Inc v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedGattellaro v Westpac Banking Corporation   HCA         ALJR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The High Court in Gattellaro v Westpac Banking Corporation   HCA         ALJR   said  at   In New South Wales there would appear to be no room for the operation of the common law doctrine of judicial notice  strictly so called  since the enactment of the Evidence Act    NSW  s     That observation was made in a case in which the question whether s   of the New South Wales Act displaced the common law was not before the Court  A majority of the Court of Appeal of New South Wales had taken judicial notice of the fact that banking institutions such as Westpac used standard forms of guarantee  The High Court held that to be erroneous  The error was not defended before the High Court and nothing turned on any difference between the common law and s     The relationship between s   and the common law was not agitated in these proceedings  I am content to act upon the basis that the section states the applicable law  authorising this Court to take judicial notice of matters of common general knowledge   The Court is invited to take judicial notice of the disadvantage of women practitioners in the legal profession as a matter of  common knowledge     generally  within the meaning of s  a   VWL  in its written submissions  identified the social fact for which it contended  The Commissioner was thereby on notice and not unfairly prejudiced were the Court to act upon the submission  The social fact propounded was the historical and persisting disadvantage of women in relation to their participation and career advancement within the legal profession  At that level of generality there was no dispute  I am prepared to take judicial notice of it  It informs a consideration of whether the VWL was  established for community service purposes  or otherwise met the public benefit requirement of the common law understanding of a charitable institution  It is not  however  critical to the characterisation of the association for the purposes of the ITAA  Characterisation depends primarily upon the objects and  to a degree  upon the activities of VWL in the relevant years of income citedCommissioners for Special Purposes of Income Tax v Pemsel   AC   The concept of charitable purposes was elaborated in a passage  which has literally acquired statutory status  from the judgment of Lord Macnaghten in Commissioners for Special Purposes of Income Tax v Pemsel   AC   at    That case concerned the Income Tax Act    UK    and   Vict  c   which provided for special allowances in relation to income tax on rents and profits of lands vested in trustees for charitable purposes so far as they were applied to charitable purposes  Lord Macnaghten said  at    Charity  in its legal sense comprises four principal divisions  trusts for the relief of poverty  trusts for the advancement of education  trusts for the advancement of religion  and trusts for other purposes beneficial to the community  not falling under any of the preceding heads  The trusts last referred to are not the less charitable in the eye of the law  because incidentally they benefit the rich as well as the poor  as indeed  every charity that deserves the name must do either directly or indirectly   It is accepted that purposes which are  beneficial to the community  must also be  within the spirit and intendment of the preamble to the Statute of Elizabeth    The High Court recently reaffirmed the application of the technical meaning to the word  charity  and its derivatives used in statutes unless a contrary intention is evident  In Central Bayside General Practice Association Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue   HCA         ALR     Gleeson CJ  Heydon and Crennan JJ referred  in a footnote  to the technical legal sense of  charitable  as that defined by Lord Macnaghten in Pemsel   AC    by reference to the spirit and intendment of the preamble to the Statute of Charitable Uses Act    UK   Their Honours referred also to      the general rule that  the word  charitable  being a word that has a technical legal meaning  when it is used in a statute it should be understood in its legal sense unless a contrary intention appears   They noted that the general rule has been accepted as the law of Australia at least since the decision of the Privy Council in Chesterman v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   UKPCHCA         CLR    They further said  at   fn     The word is commonly used in statutes  It is reasonable to assume that parliamentary counsel  taxpayers  revenue authorities  settlors  testators and others have acted on the faith of an understanding that the general rule applies   The Full Court of the Federal Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Word Investments Ltd     FCR   at   accepted  and there was no dispute before it  that the word  charitable  in the relevant provisions of the ITAA   bears its technical legal meaning  It relied upon Bayside   HCA       ALR   for that purpose   For an association to be characterised as a charitable institution it must exist for a public benefit as distinct from the creation of private benefits  The fourth class of charitable trust in Pemsel   AC   brings in the public benefit requirement through the words  beneficial to the community   As Kenny J said in The Triton Foundation   FCR at     The public may  however  include a section of the public   An association may have a public benefit purpose although some of its subsidiary or ancillary functions may benefit particular persons such as members of a profession  Royal Australian College of Surgeons v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at   and other authorities cited in The Triton Foundation   FCR at     The Commissioner contended that VWL was not a charitable institution  He argued that not all purposes which are beneficial to the public are in fact charitable  A trust of the fourth class in Pemsel   AC   must be of direct and general benefit to the public  The mere fact that it is for purposes which may tend to be of general public utility would not be sufficient  He cited Taylor v Taylor   HCA         CLR   at   and Barby v Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    He did not dispute that a trust for the promotion of the mental or moral improvement of the community could sometimes fall within the fourth class  The requirement of benefit to the public was said to commonly exclude from the status of charitable institutions organisations such as professional bodies established to help those persons who furnish the organisation s funds  These would usually be members or persons eligible for membership but could also be contributors or sponsors  If the main objects of an institution were the protection and advancement of persons practicing in a particular profession  the institution would not be regarded as charitable because the element of direct public benefit was lacking

It is an integrated  holistic enquiry directed to whether a body of facts and circumstances satisfies a legal category or conception   Importantly  the Commissioner had submitted to the Full Court that a charitable institution could conduct commercial activities but only as incidental or ancillary to its charitable activities  After referring to relevant authorities  Allsop J observed that the cases did not support the submission  He cited Scottish Burial Reform and Cremation Society Ltd v Glasgow City Corporation   UKHL       AC   and The Incorporated Council of Law Reporting of the State of Queensland v Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   and said  at       both stand as authority for the proposition that the making of a profit from the conduct of the charitable activity does not necessarily destroy the charitable nature of the purpose exhibited by the activity   Stone J agreed with Allsop J citedBowman v Secular Society Ltd   AC   Charitable purposes generally do not include political purposes  Dal Pont observes that the limitation is largely a product of   th century jurisprudence emanating principally from the dictum of Lord Parker in Bowman v Secular Society Ltd   AC   at     a trust for the attainment of political objects has always been held invalid      because the Court has no means of judging whether or not a proposed change in the law will or will not be for the public benefit  and therefore cannot say that a gift to secure the change is a charitable gift citedPublic Trustee v Attorney General     NSWLR   The political purposes limitation is

public benefit requirement   In relation to the political purposes question  VWL submitted that it was not formed for the purpose of changing a specific law or laws or government policy  One of its primary activities have been directed to maintaining and educating the community about and enforcing existing laws  The promotion of humanitarian objects and those relating to basic human rights were said to be charitable even though  on occasion   although not in this case  they might involve or require a change in policy or law  The judgment of Santow J in Public Trustee v Attorney General     NSWLR   was cited and  in particular  his Honour s observation that    There is a range of activity from direct lobbying of the government  to education of the public on particular issues  in the interests of a climate conducive to political change  The line between an object directed at legitimate educative activity compared to illegitimate political agitation is a blurred one  involving at

trust payments were to be made to the London Society for Women s Service for so long as it should  in the opinion of the trustee  continue to promote the objects of the trust  Whitford J noted that it was not suggested that the society as such was a charity in the eyes of the law although some of the activities would undoubtedly qualify as charitable  The question before him related to the object of the founder of the trust  at     So the question is whether the dominant or essential object here revealed is a political one  for it stands accepted in argument before me that if the object be a political object and if this be a purpose trust then it must be invalid  I think that it cannot seriously be contended that the object here is essentially a political object  It seems to me quite clear that the dominant or essential object is the achievement of equality albeit in political and economic fields  that the founder in no sense is concerned with any particular political or economic

the words  community service  justify resort to the explanatory memorandum to identify more precisely the legislative intention   His Honour held in that case that the trust deeds of a  Protestant

Taxation     ATR     the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  the AAT  considered whether the National Council of Women of Tasmania fell within the scope of the exemption  It was an unincorporated association  the objects of which included the advancement of the interests of women and children and humanity in general  It also brought together representatives of other women s organisations including the promotion of their activities and projects directed to community welfare  The AAT held that the Council s predominant purpose was not that of a social club or discussion group  Its political and lobbying activities had been minimal  It played an active role in community service activities and not a passive one   The AAT found that the Council would hold one annual general meeting each year  nine monthly general meetings  ten monthly executive meetings and a number of lunches and seminars  One of the  subtle roles  of the Council was to widen the support network of its affiliated organisations  Delegates and members who attended Council meetings and executive meetings would support the activities of affiliated organisations financially and by doing unpaid work  Council delegates and members assisted by donating and collecting goods for the needy such as baby clothes and by knitting items for the needy during general meetings  Most of the member organisations appeared to qualify as community service organisations   The AAT held that the predominant purpose of the Council s meetings involved the coordination of community service work and the provision of exchange of information for the purpose of facilitating such work  It held the Council to be an association established for community service purposes  not being political or lobbying purposes and so

characterisation of a non profit single member company providing private health insurance through a fund  Membership of the fund was limited to serving members of the Australian Defence Forces and cognate classes of person  The company contended that its objects promoted the efficiency of the Australian Defence Forces which benefited the community as a whole so that it would fall within the description of a  charitable institution  for the purpose of an exemption under the Fringe Benefit Tax Assessment Act    Cth   Alternatively  it submitted that it was a  non profit association  established for community service purposes and thereby attracting a life exemption   The fringe benefit tax exemption provision was based on s  g v  of the ITAA    Jessup J referred to the Explanatory Memorandum and accepted that it was clear that the words of the exemption were not limited to charitable purposes  He said  at     Although a composite expression  I consider that the essence of  community service  is that a service is provided to the community  or a section of the community  Here the word  service  is used in the sense of  health  benefit or advantage  particularly  the action of serving  helping or benefiting  conduct tending to the welfare or advantage of another   OED  nd Ed    His Honour held the term  community  to refer not only to the community as a whole but also to any identifiable section of the community  It did not follow that the receipt of a service by any group of persons should be regarded as the receipt of that service by a section of the community   The question of characterisation of the VWL in this respect is not straight forward  It submitted that it provides for the welfare of the community or a section of it  Its purposes included the carrying out of activities and undertaking of projects for women in the law who have a particular need for those projects and activities by reason of their social and economic circumstance  namely their sex   VWL also submitted that it was not involved in the furtherance of political or lobbying purposes  As to the latter it referred to the definition of lobbying in the Oxford English Dictionary       To influence  members of a house of legislature  in the exercise of their legislative functions by frequenting the lobby     To frequent the lobby of a legislative assembly for the purpose of influencing members  votes  to solicit the votes of members   VWL submitted that  lobbying  in its statutory context bore a narrow political meaning tying proscribed political activity to direct interaction with members of parliament for stated ends and purposes  It is not clear to me that the term  lobbying  is to be construed so narrowly given the width of the concept of political purposes  In my opinion it could extend to representations to government or members of parliament for changes in policy as well as changes in the law   The Commissioner submitted that the concept of  community service  is similar to that of  public benefit  in the law of charitable trusts  It would not follow that receipt of a service by any group of persons should be regarded as the receipt of that service by a section of the community  In the Commissioner s submission  community service  requires the community or a section of the community to benefit by way of receipt of some identifiable help  benefit or advantage bestowed or provided directly by the putative benefactor  Such a requirement is not satisfied  it was submitted  merely because an association s activities or some of them might have a tendency to benefit the community as a whole or a section of it  In this regard the Commissioner relied upon the observation of Jessup J where he found that the community service requirement was not satisfied merely because the operations of the organisation had a tendency to promote the efficiency of the armed forces thereby benefiting the community as a whole   In my opinion the concept of  community service  was intended to pick up a broader range of organisations than those covered by the concept of  charitable institution  and in particular that class of charitable institution falling within the rubric  beneficial to the community   However  an organisation may be beneficial to the community without delivering a  community service  in the sense contemplated by that term as explained in the Explanatory Memorandum  For the reasons I have already expressed  I am of the view that the purposes of VWL are beneficial to the community in the sense necessary to qualify it as a charitable institution  The concept of  community service  does seem to import the notion of the delivery of some practical  help  benefit or advantage  in the sense used by Jessup J  That criterion is not necessarily met by an organisation whose purpose is to change practices and attitudes in such a way as to facilitate the entry and advancement of women within the profession generally   The matter is not without difficulty and it is unnecessary to reach a concluded position on it  It is sufficient unto the day that I have found that VWL is a charitable institution  that it attracts the relevant exemption and that its appeals must therefore be allowed   Having regard to my conclusions about the status of VWL as a charitable institution  it is unnecessary to make any findings in relation to whether certain elements of its receipts were income in the relevant years  The appeals will be allowed  The orders which were suggested by the Commissioner in that event are the orders which I will make in the following terms       The appeal be allowed       The respondent s notice of assessment the subject of the appeal be set aside       There is no order as to the costs of the appeal    I certify that the preceding one hundred and sixty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable
