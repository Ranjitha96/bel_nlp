Poniatowska v Hickinbotham   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAldridge v Booth   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn my view  the conduct of Mr Flynn constituted by the May   allegations amounted to sexual harassment  He clearly made a request for sexual favours to Ms Poniatowska by his emails of   May   and   May   and by his subsequent SMS text messages  Those requests were unwelcome on the part of Ms Poniatowska  see Aldridge v Booth   FCA         ALR    It is not necessary to find whether the email of   May   was made in circumstances in which a reasonable person  having regard to all the circumstances  would have anticipated that Ms Poniatowska would be offended  humiliated or intimidated by it  That is because  in the light of her response to the first email  I find that the subsequent communications referred to  starting with the email of   May   were made in circumstances in which a reasonable person  having regard to all the circumstances including the terms of Ms Poniatowska s response  would have anticipated that she would be offended and humiliated by them  She had clearly indicated that she did not wish to receive requests for sexual favours from him  Mr Flynn nevertheless persisted to make such requests in the manner I have found  Having indicated her attitude quite clearly  it was apparent  and a reasonable person would have anticipated  that Ms Poniatowska would be offended if the requests were maintained  as they were   It was also apparent  and a reasonable person would have anticipated  that she would be humiliated by such conduct because it conveys an understanding of the potential preparedness of Ms Poniatowska to have a sexual relationship with him  notwithstanding her clearly expressed attitude to the contrary  Even if Mr Flynn did not see the situation that way  and was nevertheless hopeful of establishing a sexual relationship  that does not result in a different conclusion  The test in s  A is clearly an objective one  see generally Leslie v Graham   FCA   at    citedLeslie v Graham   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn my view

As I have found that ESA discriminated against Ms Poniatowska on the ground of her sex  and contravened s  c  of the SD Act by so discriminating against her by dismissing her  I do not need to decide whether  in the circumstances  a term of mutual trust and confidence ought be implied into Ms Poniatowska s employment contract  Such a finding would not add to the range of remedies or the extent of the compensation awarded  In those circumstances  it is appropriate simply to note the observations of Tracey J in Van Efferen v CMA Corporation Limited   FCA    It is now necessary to consider the appropriate award of damages or other relief to be granted to Ms Poniatowska  In her application  she seeks the giving of an apology or apologies from those respondents against whom adverse findings have been made citedJones v Toben   FCA         ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThere are a number of reasons for that  In the first place  in my view  the adverse findings made against the respondents in respect of the conduct concerning them individually is sufficient recognition for Ms Poniatowska of the inappropriateness of that conduct  The imposition upon those respondents  who variously denied the conduct specifically attributed to them or in some respects denied its significance  would put them in the position of requiring them to apologise for conduct which they did not accept that they had severally engaged in  see for instance the observations of Branson J in Jones v Toben   FCA         ALD   at     Jones v The Bible Believers  Church   FCA   at
