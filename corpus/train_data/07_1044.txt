P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd v Multiplex Limited   FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedJohns v Australian Securities Commission   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  On   December   solicitors for the applicant applied to ASIC for documents in relation to the Multiplex examinations  ASIC in accordance with its natural justice obligations  see Johns v Australian Securities Commission   HCA         CLR   has notified third parties who may be affected by the release of the documents and has received submissions from some of them  This has proved to be a lengthy process and ASIC has not yet provided any documents to the applicant   As has been mentioned  the documents the subject of item   of the subpoena number about    assuming  as seems reasonable  that ASIC retains the documents it has reviewed  or most of them  and have been sorted into some   folders  The remaining documents sought would seem to be relatively much less numerous   The present proceeding commenced on   December    Pleadings have been filed  Multiplex has brought applications for  i  an order under s  N of the Federal Court Act that the matter no longer proceed under Pt IVA   ii  security for costs and  iii  transfer to the New South Wales District Registry  Finkelstein J heard the s  N application on   April   and his decision is reserved  The other two applications have not yet been heard  I understand that a date will be fixed after his Honour delivers judgment on the s  N application  The matter is in Finkelstein J s docket and the present application has come before me as duty judge   The parties have been in protracted negotiations as to security for costs  The applicant accepts that security should be ordered but the parties have not agreed on quantum or the form of security  due mainly to disputes about the likely extent of discovery  security is not sought at the moment for steps beyond discovery   Initially Multiplex sought     million  of which   million was for discovery based on a review of     million documents with approximately   potentially discoverable documents  That figure has since been reduced to   million  based on an estimate of   documents  The applicant proffers     million   The applicant relies particularly on the assistance the subpoena will give in narrowing the scope of discovery and  as a consequence  reducing the amount of security ordered   Further it is said that the subpoena would subvert ASIC s natural justice considerations as required by Johns    Insofar as the subpoena by items   and   seeks the terms of reference and report of the consultant  it is said to be fishing and enquiring after irrelevant matter followedHughes v Western Australian Cricket Association  Inc      ALR   It has been firmly established since the decision of Toohey J when a judge of this Court in Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association  Inc      ALR   that a subpoena duces tecum may be directed to a non party prior to trial  The power exists  where it appears to the court to be in the interests of justice and the proper and expeditious conduct of a proceeding that a person produce documents before the date of hearing of the  substantive  application  at     That case was the converse of the present in that issue of the subpoena was opposed by the proposed recipient  the Australian Cricket Board  but the respondent in the proceeding did not appear   In the present case senior counsel for Multiplex cited a line of cases which hold that a subpoena duces tecum is not to be used as a substitute for discovery  Commissioner for Railways v Small     SR  NSW    Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Shell Co of Australia Ltd     ALR   Pasini v Vanstone   FCA    However  all these cases were concerned with subpoenas directed to a party  True it is that in Hughes  at   Toohey J  citing Small   said that a party may not though a subpoena  obtain discovery from a stranger to the action   But what was meant by obtaining discovery from a stranger emerges from the judgment of Jordan CJ in Small at      If  a subpoena duces tecum   be addressed to a stranger  it must specify with reasonable particularity the documents which are required to be produced  A subpoena duces tecum ought not to be issued to such a person requiring him to search for and produce all such documents as he may have in his possession or power relating to a particular subject matter  It is not legitimate to use a subpoena for the purpose of endeavouring to obtain what would be in effect discovery of documents against a person who  being a stranger  is not liable to make discovery  A stranger to the cause ought not to be required to go to trouble and perhaps to expense in ransacking his records and endeavouring to form a judgment as to whether any of his papers throw light on a dispute which is to be litigated upon issues of which he is presumably ignorant
