jurisdictional error   In Savouts v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA     Katz J noted that Merkel J s conclusion in Ozmanian FCA that s   required the Minister personally to decide not to consider exercising the power under s   was rejected by the Full Court in Bedlington v Chong    I think it plain that his Honour was directing his attention to the question of a decision not to exercise the power in the individual case   Katz J added  at    However  the rejection of Merkel J s conclusion on that matter appears  if anything  to make his conclusion about the unreviewability of the Departmental officer s decision by reason of the combined effect of para  e  of the Act and subs   of the Act easier to accept   Katz J said that he found nothing in the reasons for judgment of the Full Court in either Ozmanian FCAFC or Bedlington v Chong that caused him to doubt correctness of the reasoning of Merkel J in Ozmanian FCA on the particular question of the combined effect of para  e  of the Act and subs   of the Act  Katz J accepted the correctness of that reasoning and applied it to the decision said to have been made by Mr Fontana  who occupied a position in the Ministerial Interventions Unit  perhaps that occupied by Ms Connolly in the present case   An alternative basis on which the respondents contend that the proceeding must fail is that the applicants cannot obtain the relief they seek  The foundation of this submission is that s   does not contain any provision for the making of a request or application to the Minister that would trigger a legal obligation on anyone to consider it   I accept the respondents  submission that if Merkel J in Ozmanian FCA   intended to suggest that the Minister was under a duty to decide whether to consider each individual request for the exercise of the s   power  that suggestion cannot stand with the reasoning of the Full Court in Bedlington v Chong  which concerned the then s  B of the Act  a comparable provision to s    A Full Court of the Federal Court there held that it was within the competence of the Minister to lay down guidelines for determining whether any request for the exercise of the power conferred by s  B  should be referred to him  The Court held that such guidelines constitute a determination by the Minister  in advance  of the circumstances in which he will consider exercising the power  at     Their Honours said  at     that so long as the Secretary was acting within the guidelines  she had no duty to refer a request to the Minister  Their Honours added that  in saying this  they should not be understood as indicating that even if the Secretary did not act in accordance with guidelines  Ms Chong would be entitled to any relief a matter that was not before their Honours  They added that in so far as Ms Chong s application for relief was based solely on the Secretary s failure to bring her application to the Minister s attention  or on any failure of the Minister to consider her application  it must be dismissed   In their submissions  the applicants attack Ms Connolly s decision not to bring their request to the Minister s attention  relying on jurisdictional error  They rely on various grounds of such error  including a failure to adhere to the Guidelines by not paying due regard to the position of the children  a failure to take into account relevant considerations and a failure to accord procedural fairness  But for reasons previously given  in my opinion  the decision of Ms Connolly is not subject to judicial review  even if such grounds exist   Proposed Order   is not available to the applicants  As noted above at   the Act did not empower Ms Connolly to make decisions  and the decision that she did make did not affect legal rights   Proposed Order   is not available to the applicants because they do not have visas permitting them to remain in Australia that the Minister and the Secretary are threatening to disregard by removing them from Australia   Proposed Order   is not available to the applicants because the Minister has decided not to exercise his s   power  according to a r gime that is permissible  see Bedlington v Chong   above     Proposed Order   is not available to the applicants because there is no obligation on Ms Connolly to bring the applicants  repeat request to the notice of the Minister  As discussed above  the Minister has decided not to exercise his s   power in cases in which  relevantly and in effect  Ms Connolly should be of a certain opinion  and he intended that she should not bring repeat requests to his attention in cases in which she should be of that opinion  In view of s   it was entirely a matter for the Minister whether to establish a r gime that depended on the subjective opinion of Ms Connolly   For the reasons given above  the application should be dismissed with costs    I certify that the preceding seventy five   numbered paragraphs are a

respondents submitted that this Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the proceeding  relying on s   of the Act set out at   above  They submitted that Ms Connolly s actions were those of the Minister in accordance with the principles established in Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works     All ER     Carltona   that is to say  that the Minister  acting through Ms Connolly had decided not to consider the repeat request  Accordingly  they submitted  s   deprived the Court of jurisdiction   In S  of   Moore J summarised the conclusions of Merkel J in Ozmanian FCA in a series of dot points  which  with some rearrangement and comment by me  were as follows    s   provided for three kinds of decision a decision to exercise the power under s   a decision not to do so  and a decision not to consider whether to do so  at     the Carltona principle is not applicable to any of the classes of decision under s   and  relevantly  although power to make the third class of decision may be delegated under s   of the Act  it had not been  at       as a matter of fact  however  the Minister s senior adviser was authorised by the Minister to make and to communicate the third class of decision  at     a decision of the third class that was in fact made by a Departmental or Ministerial officer could not be treated as a decision of the Minister by the operation of the Carltona principle  at     the Carltona principle had no application in a legislative context where the Minister had a general power to delegate powers  including the power to decide not to consider the exercise of the s   power  at         even though the decision not to consider exercising the s   power was not made by the Minister  it was nonetheless a decision of  the Minister  for the purpose of s  e   at     it followed that the limit on jurisdiction created by s   denied the Court jurisdiction under s   of the AD JR  Act in relation to that decision  at     notwithstanding  the limit on jurisdiction did not deny the Court jurisdiction under s   of the AD JR  Act in relation to conduct engaged in for the purposes of the Minister s making a decision under s    at     Merkel J approached the matter on the basis that he could grant relief in respect of conduct under s   of the AD JR  Act  because there had been a breach of the rules of natural justice by Departmental officers in their consideration of the request   In Ozmanian FCAFC   a Full Court allowed an appeal against Merkel J s decision  Sackville J  with whom Jenkinson and Kiefel JJ agreed  considered that  the words  in respect of     decisions covered by s   as used in s   are wide enough to embrace conduct leading to a decision not to consider exercising the Minister s powers   at     discussedDin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     ALR   The present applicants rely on the holding by Merkel J that a decision not to consider exercising the s   power must be made by the Minister or by the Minister s properly authorised delegate  In addition to relying on the reasoning of Merkel J in Ozmanian FCA   they refer to the approval of his Honour s reasoning in the present respect by Wilcox J in Din v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     ALR     The applicants  present submission does not take into account Merkel J s other holding  at     to the effect that  even though the decision not to consider exercising the power had not been made by the Minister or his duly appointed delegate as required by the Act  it was nonetheless a decision made under the authority of  and in purported reliance on  s   and was therefore a decision  of  the Minister for the purposes of the jurisdiction denying provisions contained in the then ss  e  and   of the Act discussedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Ozmanian     FCR   In S  of   Moore J considered that the decisions of Merkel J in Ozmanian v Minister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethnic Affairs     ALR     Ozmanian FCA   and of the Full Court on appeal from his Honour in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Ozmanian     FCR     Ozmanian FCAFC   together provided a complete answer to the jurisdictional question discussedOzmanian v Minister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethnic Affairs     ALR   In S  of   Moore J considered that the decisions of Merkel J in Ozmanian v Minister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethnic Affairs     ALR     Ozmanian FCA   and of the Full Court on appeal from his Honour in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Ozmanian     FCR     Ozmanian FCAFC   together provided a complete answer to the jurisdictional question consideredPlaintiff S  v Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The applicants rely on Plaintiff S  v Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR     Plaintiff S     In substance  the applicants submit that s   as interpreted in Plaintiff S  has the effect that the jurisdiction denying provision of s   is not attracted where jurisdictional error exists  because that which would otherwise be  a decision of the Minister not to exercise  or not to consider the exercise  of the Minister s power under     section       is not such a decision at all   Before I address this argument  I will consider the alternative legislative basis for the respondents  contention that the Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the proceeding   This alternative basis assumes  contrary to the respondents  primary submission  that s   is not the relevant jurisdiction denying provision  but that the position is governed by the Act as it exists today   I recounted his Honour s reliance on Ozmanian FCA and Ozmanian FCAFC at     above  With respect  I agree with his Honour  subject to my returning to the applicants  argument concerning Plaintiff S    which I will now address   The first point to notice is that  if the current Part   applies  rather than the former s   even a purported privative clause decision is excluded from the Court s jurisdiction  On any reckoning  the decision not to consider exercising the s   power was a purported privative clause decision   If the former s   is governing  or if the present ss     and     and  A a  apply but the argument based on  purported  does not conclude the matter  the question that arises is whether the decision not to consider whether to exercise the s   power is vitiated for jurisdictional error in accordance with Plaintiff S    In my opinion  it cannot be  The reason turns on the express provision in s   that the Minister does not  in any circumstances  have a duty to consider whether to exercise the power under s     The Minister could have decided not to consider any requests for the exercise of his power under s   for a specified period of time  and that decision would not have been subject to review  In the present case  his decision not to consider exercising that power was of a more limited kind  It is plain that the Minister s intention  as expressed in his note of   August   relating specifically to this case  and in paras       and       of Guidelines MSI   was to decide not to consider exercising the power in the case of any request where the criteria of  unique or exceptional circumstances  were not met  in the opinion of the assessing officer   his note of   August   or where it  appears  or is  found   to or by the relevant officer   respectively Guidelines MSI   paras       and       that they are not met   The Minister s decision not to consider exercising his power under s   in the particular case of the applicants comprises his decision just referred to operating upon the subjective judgment formed by Ms Connolly  There is no suggestion in the evidence that the Minister intended anything other than that provided the officer in good faith formed the view that the  unique or  exceptional circumstances  criterion was not met  the Minister did not wish to consider exercising his s   power  The applicants do not suggest that Ms Connolly did not act in good faith followedS  of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In S  of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     S  of     the facts were similar to those of the present case  the respondents were in substance the same  and the same counsel appeared for the applicants and the respondents  In that case  as in the present one  Ms Connolly did not to pass on to the Minister a request for the exercise of the Minister s power under s    The applicants sought the following orders under s  B of the Judiciary Act    Cth  and under the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act    Cth   the AD JR  Act           An order compelling the Manager  Ms Connolly  to consider the applicants  request under section   of the Migration Act     in accordance with the Guidelines issued by the Minister and to bring the s   application to the attention of the Minister in order that the Minister can decide whether or not to consider exercising the Minister s power                 An order prohibiting the Minister and the Secretary from acting upon or giving any further effect to the Manager s failure to bring the s   application to the attention of the Minister  and prohibiting the Minister and the Secretary from removing the applicants from Australia                 An order compelling the Secretary to consider the s   application in accordance with the Minister s guidelines and to ensure that the Manager deals with the s   application in accordance with the Minister s guidelines  followedSavouts v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In Savouts v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA     Katz J noted that Merkel J s conclusion in Ozmanian FCA that s   required the Minister personally to decide not to consider exercising the power under s   was rejected by the Full Court in Bedlington v Chong    I think it plain that his Honour was directing his attention to the question of a decision not to exercise the power in the individual case   Katz J added  at    However  the rejection of Merkel J s conclusion on that matter appears  if anything  to make his conclusion about the unreviewability of the Departmental officer s decision by reason of the combined effect of para  e  of the Act and subs   of the Act easier to accept
