au cases cth federal ct  htmlThese circumstances pose a particular difficulty for the Claim groups  They bear the onus of proving that the group rights and interests they claim derive from laws and customs as they existed at sovereignty  that is  at    Lack of evidence in this respect tells against them  and in favour of those who oppose their Claims  Yet substantial written records relating to Aboriginal people in the Goldfields do not begin until the  s  Contrast the recent case of Bennell v Western Australia   FCA         FCR   in which European settlement and accompanying written records occurred soon after sovereignty  Of course  it should not be assumed that if the Goldfields had been settled in   a record of the local position at that time would necessarily have supported the present Claims  it may have defeated them  The point is simply that contemporaneous records do not exist  and any evidentiary vacuum works against the Claim groups  Since the evidence does not establish any important and relevant event between   and the earliest European records relating to the Goldfields  I infer that the situation that existed immediately when the written record began was like that at sovereignty  As discussed at     below  however  there are constraints on the  retrospective inferences  that can properly be drawn  It is  for example  one thing to infer from European observation of the presence of semi nomadic Aboriginal people in the Wongatha Claim area in and after   that semi nomadic Aboriginal people were to be found in the Wongatha Claim area in    It is another thing to infer that the latter were the ancestors of the people observed and would have  occupied  the area where the former were observed   b  The difficulty of proving claims to land by various groupings of semi nomadic people The indigenous people of the Western Desert led semi nomadic lives  They roamed over large areas  determined primarily by the availability of water and food  Since animals also needed water  the location of water in pools  rockholes and  soaks  was all important  Indeed  the Aboriginal word for water    kapi    there are different spellings  such as   gabi   was also used to refer to one s  country  in the sense of the main watering place to which one returned  particularly in time of drought  It is for this reason  that a preference has been expressed for  semi nomadic  rather than  nomadic   but I will often use  nomadic  without the qualifier  followedBranfield v Wharton   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlIn my view  the

Australia   FCA         FCR     Edward Landers    Mansfield J  at     citedBrowne v Dunn     R  For the above reasons  my conclusion is that the Wongatha application  in its original and subsequent forms  was not authorised by all the persons who  hypothetically  hold the group rights and interests comprising the particular native title claimed  as required by s   of the NTA  The accompanying affidavits under s   of the NTA and Browne v Dunn     R  The Wongatha applicants submit that there is sufficient compliance with s   and that  t he evidence on authorisation was simply not disputed   They submit that the allegations raised in final submissions were not put to the applicants in cross examination  Fourteen of the   persons who attended the Maku Stadium meeting testified  but only four of them were cross examined about the meeting at all  and none as to how they learned of it  Aubrey Lynch said      call a meeting with all the applicants that had actually lodged a claim in the area to come to a meeting at the Maku Stadium so that we can discuss amalgamation  If the word  applicants  in this passage were to be understood in a literal sense  it would signify that it was only antecedent applicants  not antecedent claimants  who attended  There would then arise in stark form the question of their authority to commit their respective claim groups to a combination  Apart from Aubrey Lynch  no applicant was cross examined on the decision making process at the meeting  Doreen Harris said that she was aware of the meeting but could not attend  Eleven of the   Wongatha applicants testified  and none were challenged on the content of their s   affidavits  The Wongatha applicants submit that in the circumstances a failure to cross examine witnesses on authorisation enlivens a principle analogous to that associated with Browne v Dunn     R     Browne v Dunn    Subsection   of the NTA provides  relevantly  that a claimant applicant must be accompanied by an affidavit sworn by the applicant      that the applicant is authorised by all the persons in the native title claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it  and     stating the basis on which the applicant is authorised as mentioned in subparagraph  iv         In a case such as the present one  all   Wongatha applicants are jointly  the applicant  NTA s    applicant  s    Authorisation is dealt with in s  B  see        There is no prescribed form of accompanying affidavit  Each of the   affidavits that accompanied the Form   that was annexed to Mr de Kerloy s affidavit sworn   February   and filed on   February   stated  relevantly      am authorised by all the persons in the native title claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to the application pursuant to the process of decision making that      under the traditional laws and customs of the persons in the native title claim group  must be complied with in relation to authorising things of that kind  and     the persons in the native title claim group have also agreed to and adopted in relation to authorising the making of the application and dealing with matters and in relation to doing things of that kind      The   s   affidavits that accompanied the Form   filed on   November   contained an almost identical formulaic paragraph  On   December   the last day of the taking of evidence  in Perth  months after all indigenous testimony had concluded in the Goldfields  the Wongatha applicants tendered the successive Wongatha Forms   and accompanying s   affidavits  Group  A objected to the tender of the affidavits  In response to a question by me  counsel for the Wongatha applicants said that he wished to rely on them as if they were read and as evidence of the truth of their contents  He claimed that the Wongatha applicants had indicated to the other parties since April   that they intended to tender the documents and that no one had raised an objection  On   February   I ordered that      shall be two folders of Forms   including affidavits annexed to them  without prejudice to the right of any party to make submissions that no weight or little weight should be given to the affidavits  In the somewhat unusual circumstances  I do not think that the failure to  cross examine all the Wongatha applicants who testified on their s   affidavits activates a principle analogous to that of Browne v Dunn   All parties proceeded on the basis that a return to the Goldfields for cross examination of the remaining   Wongatha applicants who testified on their affidavits was out of the question  and that it was a matter for me to determine the weight to be given to the affidavits in the light of all the evidence on authorisation that was before the Court  The Browne v Dunn principle is one of fairness  I do not think there is unfairness to the Wongatha applicants in the respondents being permitted to succeed on the authorisation point  Of course  if the applicants  Browne v Dunn submission had succeeded  the result would not be that the Court would be required to treat the Wongatha application as if it had been duly authorised  Conclusion on authorisation Authorisation goes to the Court s jurisdiction to make a determination on the present application  see the authorities cited at   and   above  I am not at liberty to fail to resolve the issue over jurisdiction that the respondents have raised  I hold that the Court does not have jurisdiction to hear and determine the Wongatha application  Against the possibility that I am wrong  however  I will proceed to deal with the Wongatha Claim on its merits      RELEVANT SOCIETY AT THE TIME OF SOVEREIGNTY  THE ANCESTRAL

requires the claimant community or group to establish that they have those rights and interests under traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed by that community or group   and it is not sufficient that other Aboriginal peoples acknowledge and observe the traditional laws and customs  This does not mean  however  that such a claim can succeed only if every member of the

requirement that the rights and interests be  in relation to land or waters   s     is not satisfied by a right formulated as  a right to maintain  protect and prevent the misuse of cultural knowledge  Ward HCA at      joint judgment    It is not a necessary element of the  connection  to which s  b  refers that the claimants presently physically occupy  visit or use the claim area  or have done so in the recent past  Ward HCA at      joint judgment   Their Honours stated       doubt there may be cases where the way in which land or waters are used will reveal something about the kind of connection that exists under traditional law or custom between Aboriginal peoples and the land or waters concerned  But the absence of evidence of some recent use of the land or waters does not  of itself  require the conclusion that there can be no relevant connection   Whether there is a relevant connection depends  in the first instance  upon the content of traditional law and custom and  in the second  upon what is meant by  connection  by those laws and customs  This latter question was not the subject of submissions in the present matters  the relevant contention being advanced in the absolute terms we have identified and without examination of the particular aspects of the relationship found below to have been sufficient  We  therefore  need express no view  in these matters  on what is the nature of the  connection  that must be shown to exist  In particular  we need express no view on when a  spiritual connection  with the land  an expression often used in the Western Australian submissions and apparently intended as meaning any form of asserted connection without evidence of continuing use or physical presence  will suffice    my emphasis It is possible for Aboriginal peoples to observe traditional laws and customs during periods when they have not  for one reason or another  maintained a physical connection with the claim area  but the length of the time of non use or non occupation may  depending on the circumstances  have an important bearing on whether traditional laws and customs continue to be acknowledged and observed  De Rose  No   FCAFC

Edward Landers    Mansfield J  at      The Commonwealth and Group  A rely on the related cases  Dieri People and Edward Landers   There were two applications in those cases  The first was brought by eight named people to whom I will refer as  the Dieri Mitha  and was expressed to be brought on behalf of  the Dieri People   The second was brought  also on behalf of the Dieri people  but see below  but by an  Edward Landers group  which was a sub group of the Dieri People  The second application was in respect of an area wholly within the area the subject of the Dieri Mitha application  The Edward Landers application added to its description of the group on whose behalf the application was brought  the words      native title claim group however specifically excludes all of those people listed as being the applicant group in the particulars of claim filed in the  Dieri Mitha proceeding  whilst those people s names appear as members of that applicant group     Mansfield J noted   Dieri People at   that subject to that exclusion  it was not inaccurate to describe the Edward Landers application as being on behalf of  the Dieri People   In Edward Landers   the Dieri Mitha group sought a striking out of the Edward Landers application under s  C or a summary dismissal of it under O   r  a  of the FCRs  In Dieri People   the Edward Landers group sought a striking out or summary dismissal of the Dieri Mitha application  The grounds relied on in each motion were in substance the same  In Dieri People   after referring to authorities  his Honour again observed   Dieri People at   that the NTA did not permit the making of a claim by a sub group of the  native title claim group  or the  grant   sic  of native title to a sub group of the  real  native title claim group  I agree  In my opinion  there must be a coincidence between  a  the native title claim group as defined in ss   and   of the NTA  the actual holders of the particular native title claimed   b  the claim group as defined in the Form   and  c  all of the persons who authorised the making of the application  and who must be named or otherwise defined in the Form   as required by s    In Dieri People   Mansfield J held   that the native title claim group was  the community of persons comprising the Dieri People  but the claim group described in the Dieri Mitha application was a smaller group of some Dieri people only  His Honour dismissed the application for non compliance with the authorisation requirement of s   of the NTA  I return now to the Wongatha Claim  The Wongatha applicants submit that the small claim groups in Dieri and Landers acknowledged that they were only part of  the proper claimant group  and that the  Court s reasoning focuses  on the authorisation by the claimants  not by those potential native title holders who may eventually be subject to a determination  They also submit  in relation to the Maduwongga application  that s   should not be interpreted to require authorisation of the Wongatha application by Ms Strickland and Ms Nudding  who elected to continue with their own native title claim and therefore asserted that they hold native title other than the particular native title claimed by the Wongatha applicants  The Cosmo applicants submit that any apparent overlap in group membership  as between the Wongatha and Cosmo Claim groups  is due to claims being brought on the basis of different views of how country is claimed  which is a matter to be decided on the evidence  They say that the exclusion clauses are articulations of the operation of the traditional law of Western Desert land tenure which  they submit  allows for choice in claiming country  I do not see any basis on which the Court could make a determination in favour of a group that did not include those members of the Wongatha People who were excluded in the Wongatha Form   filed on   November    As Mansfield J held in both Dieri People and Edward Landers   s   permits a native title determination application to propose only a determination in favour of all the members of the native title claim group  By reason of the exclusion  the Wongatha Claim does not meet the requirements of ss   and    I discussed Dieri People and Edward Landers in the context of the Wongatha application at       ff  and will not repeat the discussion here  Those cases are not on all fours with the Wutha case because the determination that was sought was one on behalf of the larger group  Mansfield J held   Dieri People at     Edward Landers at     in substance  that there must be a coincidence between the group for which a determination is sought and the authorising group  With respect  I agree  and refer to my discussion at       followedDrury v Western Australia   FCA

J  at     Dieri People  Mansfield J  at   Edward Landers v South Australia   FCA         FCR     Edward Landers    Mansfield J  at      The Commonwealth and Group  A rely on the related cases  Dieri People and Edward Landers   There were two applications in those cases  The first was brought by eight named people to whom I will refer as  the Dieri Mitha  and was expressed to be brought on behalf of  the Dieri People   The second was brought  also on behalf of the Dieri people  but see below  but by an  Edward Landers group  which was a sub group of the Dieri People  The second application was in respect of an area wholly within the area the subject of the Dieri Mitha application  In Edward Landers   the Dieri Mitha group sought a striking out of the Edward Landers application under s  C or a summary dismissal of it under O   r  a  of the FCRs  In Dieri People   the Edward Landers group sought a striking out or summary dismissal of the Dieri Mitha application  The grounds relied on in each motion were in substance the same  In Edward Landers   Mansfield J noted   ff  that the reason for the express exclusion in the Edward Landers application was twofold  the application of s  C  of the NTA  and the fact that six of the persons excluded had given instructions that they did not wish to be included in the Edward Landers application  Mansfield J said   that  whatever the reason  the Edward Landers application did not comply with s   because it did not describe the native title claim group  sufficiently clearly so that it can be ascertained whether any particular person is one of those persons  rather  it described a smaller group that remained after the exclusion  The Edward Landers applicant group was a sub group of the native title claim group  His Honour said   that the NTA does not permit the making of an application by a sub group of a native title claim group or the recognition of native title as being held by such a sub group of the  real  native title claim group  His Honour dismissed the Edward Landers application  The Wongatha applicants submit that the small claim groups in Dieri and Landers acknowledged that they were only part of  the proper claimant group  and that the  Court s reasoning focuses  on the authorisation by the claimants  not by those potential native title holders who may eventually be subject to a determination  They also submit  in relation to the Maduwongga application  that s   should not be interpreted to require authorisation of the Wongatha application by Ms Strickland and Ms Nudding  who elected to continue with their own native title claim and therefore asserted that they hold native title other than the particular native title claimed by the Wongatha applicants  The Cosmo applicants submit that any apparent overlap in group membership  as between the Wongatha and Cosmo Claim groups  is due to claims being brought on the basis of different views of how country is claimed  which is a matter to be decided on the evidence  They say that the exclusion clauses are articulations of the operation of the traditional law of Western Desert land tenure which  they submit  allows for choice in claiming country  I do not see any basis on which the Court could make a determination in favour of a group that did not include those members of the Wongatha People who were excluded in the Wongatha Form   filed on   November    As Mansfield J held in both Dieri People and Edward Landers   s   permits a native title determination application to propose only a determination in favour of all the members of the native title claim group  By reason of the exclusion  the Wongatha Claim does not meet the requirements of ss   and    I discussed Dieri People and Edward Landers in the context of the Wongatha application at       ff  and will not repeat the discussion here  Those cases are not on all fours with the Wutha case because the determination that was sought was one on behalf of the larger group  Mansfield J held   Dieri People at     Edward Landers at     in substance  that there must be a coincidence between the group for which a determination is sought and the authorising group  With respect  I agree  and refer to my discussion at       citedFejo v Northern Territory   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Native title is not an institution or creature

NTA   governs the recognition  protection  extinguishment and impairment of native title   my emphasis  Native Title Act Case at    joint judgment     Because native title has its origin in traditional laws and customs  and is neither an institution of the common law nor a form of common law tenure  it is necessary to curb the tendency  perhaps inevitable and natural  to conduct an inquiry about the existence of native title rights and interests in the language of the common law property lawyer  Yarmirr HCA at    joint judgment   This is so  notwithstanding the requirement that the rights and interests be  in relation to land or waters  and the use of the word  title  Yarmirr HCA at    joint judgment   In Ward HCA at   and    joint judgment  their Honours found the concept of a  bundle of rights  a useful metaphor for native title    Nor is it necessary to identify a claimed right or interest as one which carries with it  or is supported by  some enforceable means of excluding from its enjoyment those who are not its holders  The reference to rights and interests enjoyed under traditional laws and customs invites attention to how  presumably as a matter of traditional law   breach of the right and interest might be dealt with  but it also invites attention to how  as a matter of custom   the right and interest is observed  The latter element of the inquiry seems directed more to identifying practices that are regarded as socially acceptable  rather than looking to whether the practices were supported or enforced through a system for the organised imposition of sanctions by the relevant community  Again  therefore  no a priori assumption can or should be made that the only kinds of rights and interests referred to in para  a  of s   are rights and interests that were supported by some communally organised and enforced system of sanctions  Yarmirr HCA at    joint judgment   original emphasis     The underlying existence of the traditional laws and customs is a necessary pre requisite for native title  but their existence is not a sufficient basis for recognising native title  because of the possibility of extinguishment   my emphasis  Fejo at    joint judgment    Post sovereignty adaptations or variations in pre sovereignty traditional laws and customs are not necessarily a disqualification  but they must themselves be rooted in  allowed by   the social structures of the relevant indigenous society as those structures existed at sovereignty  what is inconsistent with the NTA s concept of native title is that new rights and interests attributable to indigenous laws and customs should come into being after sovereignty  because their doing so could be due only to a right and interest creating system of norms parallel to  and in competition with  the legal system which owes its existence to sovereignty  Yorta Yorta HCA at          joint judgment     Callinan J    Even if rights and interests can be shown to have been possessed under traditional  pre sovereignty  laws and customs  if there is now no longer an indigenous society which acknowledges those laws and observes those customs  the rights and interests no longer exist  it is not enough that particular individuals acknowledge the traditional laws and observe the traditional customs or hope for their restoration  Yorta Yorta HCA at      joint judgment       Callinan J    Laws and customs  and  society  in the present context  are interrelated   society  is to be understood as a body of persons united in and by its acknowledgment and observance of a body of law and customs  Yorta Yorta HCA at    joint judgment   Laws and customs are sustained only by a society which continues to acknowledge and observe them   The NTA s use of the expression  traditional laws acknowledged and traditional custom observed   my emphasis  obviates any need to distinguish between traditional law on the one hand  and traditional custom on the other  but     the subject of consideration is rights or interests  the rules which together constitute the traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed  and under which the rights or interests are said to be possessed  must be rules having normative content   Without that quality  there may be observable patterns of behaviour but not rights or interests in relation to land or waters     Yorta Yorta HCA at    joint judgment   my emphasis  The word  traditional  in the present context signifies  not only that the law or custom  has been passed from generation to generation of a society  usually by word of mouth and common practice  but also  that  the origins of the content of the law or custom concerned are to be found in the normative rules of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies that existed before the assertion of sovereignty by the British Crown  and that    the reference to rights or interest in land or waters being possessed under traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed by the peoples concerned  requires that the normative system under which the rights and interests are possessed  the traditional laws and customs  is a system that has had a continuous existence and vitality since sovereignty   If that normative system has not existed throughout that period  the rights and interests which owe their existence to that system will have ceased to exist  And any later attempt to revive adherence to the tenets of that former system cannot and will not reconstitute the traditional laws and customs out of which rights and interests must spring if they are to fall within the definition of native title    my emphasis      Yorta Yorta HCA at      joint judgment  The expression  recognised by the common law of Australia  in s  c  of the NTA does not mean  created by or arising from the common law of Australia  but rather   acceptable to and not inconsistent with the common law of Australia   On this point  see Brennan J in Mabo  No   at    recognition or the rights and intents by the common law must not  fracture a skeletal principle of our legal system  and at    or be  so repugnant to natural justice  equity and good conscience that judicial sanctions under the new r gime must be withheld   See also Wik Peoples v Queensland   HCA         CLR     Wik   at    Brennan CJ  and Yarmirr HCA at    joint judgment   In Ward HCA at    joint judgment  it was suggested that there would be a failure to satisfy para  c  if the laws and customs which met the requirements of paras  a  and  b  clashed with  the general objectives of the common law of the preservation and protection of society as a whole   Further illustration is that the traditional rights and interests might be of such a nature as not to be amenable to enforcement as common law rights  because  for example  of insufficient precision  Yorta Yorta HCA at      Callinan J     W hen the tide of history has washed away any real acknowledgment of traditional law and any real observance of traditional customs  the foundation of native title has disappeared  and  a  native title which has ceased with the abandoning of laws and customs based on tradition cannot be revived for contemporary recognition  Mabo  No   at      Brennan J   Counsel for Group  A submits      Brunton was cross examined a deal about bias     Dr Brunton has expressed views as to the Mabo decision  the role of the High Court and other matters  They are no different to views publicly expressed by   inter alia   Sir Harry Gibbs  Heydon J  the Hon  Tim Fisher  In respect of the comments regarding Mabo they appear to be little different to the view of Dawson J in dissent in that case  It would have been thought obvious that this does not preclude a witness from expressing an expert opinion on a matter within his expertise  anymore than Mr Vachon s attendance at various rallies would preclude him        The submission does not identify the other views  publicly expressed  and  in any event  they would be presently irrelevant  It is one thing to express an opinion that a High Court decision is out of accord with an earlier course of authority  or to express concern over the practical effects a decision will have  it is another thing for a person professing to have the dispassionate objectivity  self restraint and self discipline of an expert witness  to attack a court in intemperate terms  unless it feels like it   lawless condition   avenging High Court  from an overtly political platform  It is unfortunate that Dr Brunton s curriculum vitae lists many articles which he now explains as having merely made political points  An article that does no more than this goes no way towards establishing that the person has

cases cth federal ct  htmlThe applicants submit that it is well established as a matter of law that courts should infer the  existence and content of traditional laws and customs  rights and interests  and connection with the claimed area  back to     sovereignty   I agree  In Gumana v Northern Territory   FCA         FCR   at     Selway J referred to the common law authorities relating to the proof of customs since time immemorial  However  the shorter the period that has to be covered by an inference of retrospective continuance  the better  In the present case  the acknowledgment and observance of pre sovereignty laws and customs may have been affected by events since European settlement in  say  the early  s  including the migration from the desert to the towns and settlements of the Goldfield  the abandonment of the nomadic life in the desert  and the dominance of the non Aboriginal culture  The point is that where  as here  the task is to ascertain what the pre sovereignty body of laws and customs was  I prefer to look first for the earliest available evidence of laws and customs as they existed after first contact  Admittedly  in some cases  the earliest available record may have been made long after first contact  The proper drawing of inferences depends on the application of logic and human experience to the facts that are proved by admissible evidence  Upon analysis  I am asked to draw two inferences here  an inference that certain activities and behaviour observed since first contact are a continuation of pre sovereignty activities and behaviour  an inference of retrospective continuance  and an inference that the activities and behaviour are attributable to pre sovereignty and continuing laws and customs  an inference of attribution    The inference of attribution is discussed below at    c    ff  Wigmore on Evidence    rd ed  vol     describes the inference of retrospective continuance       the existence of an object  condition  quality  or tendency at a given time is in issue  the prior existence of it is in human experience some indication of its probable persistence or continuance at the later period           degree of probability of this continuance depends on the chances of intervening circumstances having occurred to bring the existence to an end  The possibility of such circumstances will depend almost entirely on the nature of the specific thing whose existence is in issue and the particular circumstances affecting it in the case in hand  That a soap bubble was in existence half an hour ago affords no inference at all that it is in existence now  that Mt  Everest was in existence ten years ago is strong evidence that it exists yet  whether the fact of a tree s existence a year ago will indicate its continued existence today will vary according to the nature of the tree and the conditions of life in the region  So far  then  as the interval of time is concerned  no fixed rule can be laid down  the nature of the thing and the circumstances of the particular case must control          considerations affect the use of subsequent existence as evidence of existence at the time in issue  Here the disturbing contingency is that some circumstance operating in the interval may have been the source of the subsequent existence  and the propriety of the inference will depend on the likelihood of such intervening circumstances having occurred and been the true origin  On landing at New York it can hardly be inferred that the steamer at the next dock has been there for a week  but it may usually be inferred that the dock has been there for some years  while the particular circumstances of appearance and the like will in the latter instance affect the length of time to which the inference could be carried back  Here  as with prior indications  the interval of time to which the inference will be allowable must depend upon the nature of the thing and the circumstances of the particular case          opponent     may always attempt to explain away the effect of the evidence by showing that in the meantime other circumstances have occurred to raise a probability of change instead of continuance  In Harrington Smith v Western Australia  No   at   I referred to the distinction between expert opinion evidence  expert non opinion evidence  non expert opinion evidence  and  implicitly  non expert non opinion evidence  I noted that the various experts  reports were tendered only as expert opinion evidence  I also remarked     on the difficulty of applying the concept of

they were both karimarra   She said that she was given away by a man called Tony Green  and that both she and Mr Narrier were too young to know about skin systems at the time  She said she was about   years old  She said that they did not get into trouble  probably because they were living on a station  not in a camp  Ms Walker s second husband  Peter Muir  is a non Aboriginal man  he has been

respect  it is akin to the Court s ordinary form of application which must state the relief claimed  I do not accept that all departures from a Form   from counsel s opening  or from the way in which a case was presented at the hearing  are impermissible  The permissibility of any particular variance depends on the prohibition in s   of the NTA of an amendment enlarging the area claimed  and on natural justice considerations  It is undisputed that I am at liberty to make a determination involving native title rights and interests less extensive than those claimed  The Wongatha Claim group is the group described in the Wongatha Form    to which the Wongatha POC are subordinate  Harrington Smith v WA  No        ALR   at     The description of that group contained in the Wongatha Form   is sufficiently certain to enable it to be determined whether any particular person is a member of the group  Any disparity between a Form   and POC  between a Form   and indigenous testimony  or between a Form   and counsel s understanding  does not establish that the group description in the Form   suffers from an insoluble problem of uncertainty  Nor  necessarily  does difficulty over whether a particular individual falls within the description  provided the description  by a process of construction  enables the difficulty to be resolved  The process of decision making allowed by the NTA  traditional and non traditional The second general attack made by the respondents on authorisation is directed to the process by which the applicants were authorised  What it means for all the persons in a native title claim group to authorise a person or persons to make a native title determination application is laid down in s  B of the NTA  set out at        For convenience  I will refer to the processes of decision making identified in paras  a  and  b  of s  B as  traditional  and  non traditional  respectively  Group  A submits that no evidence has been provided of authorisation of the further amended application of    It also submits that the Wongatha applicants imply that later amendments were authorised by a s  B b  process  It is not clear to which amendments Group  A is

According to the NK   Form   the group consists of  all  those persons with traditional and cultural associations to the Claim area   Standing alone  this description is too vague to enable it to be known whether a person is part of the NK   Claim group or not  However  the Form   description continues by saying that the group can be described as   a  Dolly Walker  Kado Muir  Maxine Beaman and Shirley Wonyabong  and   b  those persons with a traditional and cultural association to the NK   Claim area who   i  identify solely with the NK   Claim group  and   ii  are accepted by the NK   Claim group as members of the NK   Claim Group in accordance with the laws and customs of the NK   Claim group  Accordingly  the four persons mentioned in  a  are definitely part of the NK   Claim group  but Dolly Walker s brother  Paddy Walker  for example  not being named in  a  would be a member of the NK   Claim group only if he satisfied  b   Paragraph  b  raises the problem of the uncertainty of the meaning of  a traditional and cultural association   Persons who satisfy that description must also  i  identify solely with the NK   Claim group  and  ii  be accepted by that group

simply as to his or her own activity  it will be a question whether it is appropriate to infer from the number of witnesses who give evidence of that kind that the Claim  group  on a fair overall view  engages in that activity  Group  A frequently submitted that where some only of the witnesses from a particular Claim group testified on a particular matter  I should draw an inference of the kind associated with Jones v Dunkel   HCA         CLR   at    Kitto J  the inference suggested being that evidence from the other witnesses from that group would not have assisted with respect to that matter  Where it is clear  as it has been in this case  that evidence in respect of acknowledgement and observance of laws and customs is being adduced by reference to a list of topics  and only some of the witnesses from a Claim group testify in relation to a topic  it does seem appropriate to draw a Jones v Dunkel inference  However  I see this issue as part of the larger issue mentioned  how is acknowledgement and observance by a  group  to be proved I will not attempt to give a general answer to this question here  but note that little attempt was made by the various applicants to demonstrate why I should infer that the Claim group on a fair overall view  not every member  should be found to acknowledge a particular law  or to observe a particular custom   iv  How many traditional laws and customs must still be acknowledged and observed It is a  body  of laws and customs to which Yorta Yorta HCA refers    Section   of the NTA predicates the continued acknowledgement and observance of a pre sovereignty body of laws and customs  A consequence of the reduction of the Maduwongga claim group to the Strickland Nudding group  is that the question of present day acknowledgment and observance relates to whether Ms Strickland and Ms Nudding and their biological descendants observe and acknowledge these  laws and customs   No biological descendant of either sister testified  Each has children who are mature adults  The two sisters and their biological descendants are a comparatively small Claim group  The task confronting the Maduwongga applicants was  and was know to them to be  to prove that the Maduwongga Claim group continues to acknowledge and observe traditional laws and customs  There is no suggestion that the Maduwongga applicants could not have called some of their biological descendants to testify  I infer that none of the biological descendants could have given evidence which would have significantly assisted in respect of the acknowledgment and observance by the Maduwongga Claim group of traditional laws and customs  Jones v Dunkel   Anor   HCA         CLR   at    and see    c      ff     Tjukurrpa Asked whether she knew

something like  featherfoot warrior  and that the word for water snake is   warnampi    I will treat this as two slips of the tongue by Ms Strickland  If it was not  it would tell heavily against her

http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  At the time of the acquisition of sovereignty by the Crown  the accompanying common law recognised certain rights and interests held by indigenous people in relation to land and waters under their existing traditional laws and customs  Mabo v Queensland  No     HCA         CLR     Mabo  No      According to the preamble to the NTA  the High Court  in Mabo  No     rejected the doctrine of terra nullius and held that  the common law of Australia recognises a form of native title that reflects the entitlement of the original inhabitants of Australia  in accordance with their laws and customs  to their traditional lands   Paragraphs  a  and  b  of s   are based on what was said by Brennan J in Mabo  No   at   see Ward HCA at    joint judgment   In Ward HCA   the joint judgment acknowledged that account may be taken of what was decided and said in Mabo  No     when the meaning and effect of the NTA is being considered   ibid    Deane and Gaudron JJ stated in Mabo  No           common law native title is a communal native title and the rights under it are communal rights enjoyed by a tribe or other group  It is so with Aboriginal title in the Australian States and internal Territories    Also in Mabo  No     Brennan J stated       it be necessary to categorise an interest in the land as proprietary in order that it survive a change in sovereignty  the interest possessed by a community that is in exclusive possession of land falls into that category  Whether or not land is owned by individual members of a community  a community which asserts and asserts effectively that none but its members has any right to occupy or use the land has an interest in the land that must be proprietary in nature  there is no other proprietor        It may be noted  in passing  that the circumstances contemplated by Brennan J are far removed from those of the present case  His Honour said   however  that that there was no impediment to the recognition of individual rights  whether proprietary or non proprietary   dependent on the community title   He also observed       course in time the laws and customs of any people will change and the rights and interests of the members of the people among themselves will change too  But so long as the people remain as an identifiable community  the members of whom are identified by one another as members of that community living under its laws and customs  the communal native title survives to be enjoyed by the members according to the rights and interests to which they are respectively entitled under the traditionally based laws and customs  as currently acknowledged and observed        Brennan J also referred  at         to sub group and individual native title rights or interests which were  dependent on  and  carved out of  the communal native title  His Honour s analysis therefore seems to be that the largest entity is the  community  the smallest is the  individual  and the  sub group  lies between the two  In Ward FCAFC   Beaumont and von Doussa JJ also emphasised the communal nature of native title  Their Honours said       submissions  a reference to a submission by the State that  inter alia  the determination in favour of the Miriuwung and Gajerrong people was in error because it had the effect of giving Miriuwung people an interest in Gajerrong country and vice versa  notwithstanding a finding that Miriuwung country and Gajerrong country were separate territories  fail to recognise that rights of occupation  use and control of particular areas enjoyed by the Miriuwung and Gajerrong community  and the estate groups within it  are a consequence of the communal title shared by the composite community under the traditionally based laws and customs as currently acknowledged and observed by it    my emphasis The State submits  that a  community  is the largest grouping of indigenous people who  collectively  possess rights and interests in a particular area of land  and is the equivalent of a  society   I agree  In Yorta Yorta HCA   Gleeson CJ  Gummow and Hayne JJ treated  community  and  society  interchangeably  but preferred to use  society  at    fn   to emphasise the close relationship between the group and the identification of the laws and customs of that group  In my view  s   reveals a taxonomy of the kinds of native title recognised by the NTA  communal  group and individual  The community  the largest possible native title owning entity  is in fact the society whose laws and customs are in question  The group is smaller  and will ordinarily have a fluctuating membership  so  of course  will the community   The individual is the smallest possible native title owning entity  The State submits that the community or society will be comprised of subgroups and individuals who have particular rights and interests in its land  Thus  the submission is that the reference in s   to  native title  or  native title rights and interests  as meaning the  communal  group or individual rights and interests of Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders in relation to land or waters  is a reference  first  to the collective native title of the larger community  and  second  to the particular native title rights and interests of subgroups and individuals within that community  I agree  I accept the following submission made by the State      the Wongatha claimants  claim is viewed as a  communal  or as a  group  claim  the Wongatha claimants must establish that  collectively  whether as a  community  or as a corporate  group   the Wongatha people  they acknowledge and observe a  pre sovereignty  body of laws and customs which  for them  constitutes a normative system and under which they possess rights and interests in  and have a connection with  the claim area        The word  corporate  here merely reinforces the  collective  idea  and might have been omitted  The Wongatha Claim group must  possess on a collective basis  the rights and interests in question  This is the significance of a claim of group rights and interests as distinct from a claim of individual rights and interests  Yet  as the State submits  both the Wongatha claimants and the anthropologists pointed to claims made on an individual basis  unmediated by any necessity for membership of a land owning  group   see    c  for a more detailed discussion   It may be said that this was also true in De Rose   In De Rose   however  the Nguraritja were a traditional group the group constituted by

first instance  were referred to by Finn J in McKenzie v South Australia     ALR   at     and I need not refer to them  In my view  the applicable test under s   is that a pre Amending NTA application  that was amended after the commencement of the Amending NTA  is  made  to the Court under Div   of Pt   of the New NTA if the amended application is properly to be regarded as a  new application  or

Conservation  NSW    FCA   at     and Finn J in McKenzie v South Australia     ALR   at    I need not consider here private law rights that members of the original Maduwongga Claim group might have  or have had  against the Maduwongga applicants  or procedural safeguards such as notice to those members  on which the Court might have insisted when dealing with the motion for leave to amend  These matters were not the subject of submissions   c  Is the Strickland Nudding group  having Ms Strickland and Ms Nudding as its  apical ancestors  a group capable of holding native title The answer to this question is  No  because  first  Western Desert traditional law and custom did not recognise as a landowning group a group based on cognatic descent from an apical ancestor  and  second  the Strickland Nudding group was devised by the Maduwongga applicants unilaterally and arbitrarily  and not in accordance with Western Desert law and custom  out of a larger group of that kind citedMakita  Australia  Pty Ltd v Sprowles   NSWCA         NSWLR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  htmlThe non indigenous respondents reminded me of the criteria for the admissibility and role of expert opinion evidence  They referred  in particular  to Makita  Australia  Pty Ltd v Sprowles   NSWCA         NSWLR   at      Heydon JA  and to my own judgments in Allstate Life Insurance Co v ANZ  No       FCR   at     and Harrington Smith v Western Australia  No   at    I need not embark upon a general discussion of the rules governing the admissibility of expert opinion evidence    Anthropologists  notes as evidence of factsdiscussedMason v Tritton     NSWLR  I suggest that the answer is  not necessarily   The point was made succinctly by Gleeson CJ in the following well known passage from Mason v Tritton     NSWLR   at       is an activity which is so natural to people who occupy  or visit  coastal regions  that some care needs to be exercised in passing from an observation that people have engaged in that activity to an assertion that they are members of a class who have exercised some form of right pursuant to a system of rules recognised by the common law  I have no difficulty in regarding the changes from residence in wiltjas  Aboriginal bough shelters  to residence in houses  from hunting on foot with spears to the use of motorised transport and rifles  and from the use of sharp stones to razor blades in the ceremony of male initiation  as adaptations  However  whether residence within a Claim area and hunting by an individual are probative of a standard or norm will require close attention to the reasons why the individual resides in the Claim area or hunts  I discuss this question further at    c   ff  The fact that the expression  native title rights and interests  is defined in s   of the NTA to include  hunting  gathering or fishing  rights and interests  is not inconsistent with what I have said above  Whether any of such rights and interests are included in the bundle of rights and interests in a particular case will depend on the evidence in that case   j  Authorisation a problem for some groups The non indigenous respondents challenge the authorisation of every Claim except the MN Claim  which was lodged prior to the enactment of the authorisation requirement by the Amending NTA  and was not amended subsequently   Authorisation is addressed in the first section  Prior to the enactment of the Amending NTA in   s   of the NTA obliged the Court to  pursue the objective of providing a mechanism of determination that is fair  just  economical  informal and prompt   subs   required the Court to  take account of the cultural and customary concerns of Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders   subs   and provided that the Court was  not bound by technicalities  legal forms or rules of evidence    subs    my emphasis   I discussed this issue to some extent at     and referred at   to Mason v Tritton   Should an inference of attribution be drawn  that is  an inference that observed behaviour is attributable to  or explained by  a law or custom Although the present issue arises in relation to all Claims  it is highlighted in the submissions of the Cosmo applicant and the State  The State submitted      first respondent does not submit that  observable behaviour  is irrelevant or insignificant to an enquiry into whether or not laws and customs exist  It is not  however  correct to say  as the Cosmo Newberry respondents submit  that   any patterning in what claimants do  and what their ancestors have done  must be attributable to  or alternatively  be regarded as evidence of the existence of a law acknowledged or custom observed   This  it is submitted  is to read too much into behaviour that may be attributable to instinct  impulses or desires that are not normative in nature  The utilisation of food and other resources that occur in the natural environment provides an example of behaviour which  in itself  sheds no light upon whether or not laws or customs exist  The procurement of food is essential to survival  The presence of human beings in any place  prior to the development of rapid transport  is attributable to  and at the same time evidence of the fact that food has been procured by those people  To suggest that hunting  fishing or gathering per se should be regarded as evidence of the existence of a law acknowledged or custom observed is  it is submitted  inappropriate  The first respondent acknowledges that where behaviour that might be attributable to an impulse  instinct or desire that is not normative in nature is executed in a way that is not relevantly related to the satisfaction of the instinct  impulse or desire  those embellishments in the behaviour may provide evidence of the existence of a law or custom  It is necessary  however  to exercise considerable caution and careful analysis in attempting to distinguish between aspects of behaviour that may be attributable in a practical way to the satisfaction of instinct  impulse or desire  and aspects of behaviour that indicate the existence of a law or custom  For these reasons it is not appropriate to infer  simply because everybody does something  that there must be a law requiring people to behave in that way  or a custom under which that behaviour is expected to occur          first respondent does not suggest that there must be a particular level of precision or conciseness in the way in which traditional laws and customs are articulated by a person to acknowledge and observe those laws and customs  There should however be an identifiable proposition which becomes apparent with reasonable clarity from an examination of the whole of the evidence on a particular subject  A large number of references to a particular subject and repetitious assertions that laws exist in relation to a topic does not  in the first respondent s submission  assist the Court in identifying whether or not a law or custom is acknowledged and observed  It is only when a particular form of behaviour can be identified as a requirement of a traditional law or custom that there can be said to be a law or custom relating to the particular subject  The Cosmo applicant responded      Cosmo Newberry Respondents are at a loss to know how it could ever be proven that a person for example  hunts on their traditional country because they have that right under traditional law and customs  as opposed to hunting on their traditional country because they want to eat a kangaroo  Impulses  instincts and desires are inseverable from the impact  expectations and normative influence of one s society  It is a nonsense to expect the level of proof  consistency and categorisation of human behaviour implicit in the Respondents  submissions in relation to traditional laws and customs  The Cosmo Newberry Respondents submit that your Honour should consider all evidence of patterns of  observable behaviour  within the context of Western Desert laws and customs and in accordance with the submissions of the Cosmo Newberry respondents  citedMembers of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlThe Full Court   distinguished Yorta Yorta HCA on the basis that  on the primary judge s findings  the traditional laws and customs of the Yorta Yorta community had not been acknowledged and observed substantially uninterrupted since sovereignty    The primary judge in that case   Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria   FCA   had found that the claimants and their ancestors had not continued to acknowledge and observe traditional laws and customs in relation to the land of their forebears  and that before the end of the nineteenth century their ancestors had ceased to occupy their traditional lands in accordance with their traditional laws and customs  In contrast  and as noted above at   their Honours observed   that in De Rose   it did not appear that the respondents had contended at trial  that the WDCB society had not existed at sovereignty  that the WDCB society did not provide for persons recognised as Nguraritja to possess rights and interests in relation to land  that the WDCB society had ceased to exist  or that members of the WDCB society had ceased to observe traditional laws and customs at any time between sovereignty and the trial and as noted above at      The importance of these matters not being in issue is obvious  After quoting the observations which the Full Court made at    referred to at   above  the State  submits that in these proceedings  virtually all of the factual premises advanced by the Claim groups are disputed  It submits that the evidence has failed to establish that the WDCB laws and customs constitute a  normative system  under which rights and interests of the kind described in the various Forms   are possessed in the respective Claim areas  As well  it submits that no Claim group has established that as a group it acknowledges and observes such laws and customs  even if the latter constitute a normative system  The Full Court in De Rose FCAFC further stated       it were necessary to go back to the evidence  there is ample support for the proposition that  whatever the degree of acknowledgment or observance of traditional laws and customs by the appellants themselves  Western Desert society has continued to exist since sovereignty and the traditional laws and customs of that society have continued substantially uninterrupted throughout that period   Their Honours referred to anthropological evidence in support    Their Honours said   that this conclusion did not mean that the appellants were relieved of the obligation to prove that they had continued to acknowledge and observe the traditional laws and customs of the WDCB  and that they possessed rights and interests under those laws and customs  It did mean  however  that  the appellants  claim  did  not encounter the obstacle upon which the claim of the Yorta Yorta people foundered   The Full Court stated   that the primary judge s finding to the effect that the appellants did not constitute  or were not part of  a social  communal or political organisation on or near the claim area  could not properly adversely affect their claim  and that to the extent that his Honour had thought otherwise  he had erred    De Rose  No   FCAFC Having allowed the appeal  the same Full Court  subsequently in De Rose  No   FCAFC   determined that native title existed in the claim area  Of present interest in De Rose  No   FCAFC is their Honours  discussion     of the meaning of the expression  communal  group or individual rights and interests  as that expression appears in s   of the NTA  It will be recalled that in Yorta Yorta HCA   the joint judgment stated   that in the present context      is to be understood as a body of persons united in and by its acknowledgment and observance of a body of law and customs        and in a footnote to this passage  their Honours said they had chosen the word  society  rather than  community  in order to emphasise the close relationship between the identification of the group and the identification of its laws and customs  The implication is that  otherwise   community  would have done as well  All eight Claims before the Court are claims by groups to hold group rights and interests  They are claims of rights and interests which inhere in a group of fluctuating membership  In my opinion  enjoyment of those rights and interests  by an individual depends upon that individual s being a member of the group  In my view  which is consistent with     of the Full Court s judgment in De Rose  No   FCAFC   the expression  communal  group or individual rights or interests  reflects a taxonomy  The  community  is the  society  which sustains the traditional laws and customs in question  and is therefore the largest possible right or interest owning entity  eg the Meriam People in Mabo  No      At the other extreme is the individual  Any right or interest owning entity lying between the individual and the community is a  group   A group may be numerically small  as in De Rose   or numerically large  as in the case of the Wongatha Claim group  On the other hand  a numerically small or large number of individuals may all hold only individual rights and interests  Everything depends on the content of the traditional laws and customs  Many  perhaps most  or even all  groups will have a fluctuating membership  Again  all depends on how the group is identified by the traditional laws and customs  In the case of group rights and interests  the individual members of the group  claimants  have rights and interests by reason of that membership   Their rights and interests will not  however  necessarily be identical  A member may have  active  or  productive  rights and interests only in a particular area  and his or her rights and interests in the remainder will then be only  nominal   residual  or  theoretical   As ever  the governing consideration is the traditional laws and customs  But the individual s rights and interests will always arise from his or her membership of the group  they will not arise directly and without group mediation  from the laws and customs of the society  In De Rose  No   FCAFC   their Honours stated the position       in a manner which  I believe  is consistent with what I have said in the preceding paragraph      The distinction between group and individual rights and interests  to the extent it matters  is perhaps more difficult to identify  An example of group rights and interests may be those held by a subset of a wider community  the traditional laws and customs of which determine who has interests in particular sites or areas  The members of the subset may or may not themselves be an identifiable community  but their rights and interests are determined by the traditional laws and customs observed by the wider community  The members of the subset might be expected  under the traditional laws and customs  to share common characteristics in relation to certain land or waters  such as rights and responsibilities as the custodians of particular sites  Ordinarily  it might be expected that the  group  holding native title rights and interests would have a fluctuating membership  the composition of which would be determined by the relevant body of traditional laws acknowledged and customs observed          A person holding individual native title rights and interests  by contrast  may not necessarily share common characteristics  in relation to land or waters  with other members of that community under the relevant body of traditional laws and customs  Unless the traditional laws and customs provide for the individual rights and interests to be transmitted to other community members  they presumably will terminate upon the death of the holder                  If it is necessary to classify the rights and interests claimed by the appellants in the present case  they are best regarded as group rights and interests  rather than individual rights and interests  It is true that the appellants do not claim to be a discrete or functioning community and that the normative system on which they rely for their rights and interests is that of the wider Western Desert Bloc  But the appellants claim to be Nguraritja for the claim area and  by virtue of that status  they have common rights and responsibilities under the laws and customs of the Western Desert Bloc in relation to the claim area  although not necessarily in relation to precisely the same sites or tracks   Moreover  the appellants claim on behalf of all people who are Nguraritja for the claim area  The composition of that class will vary from time to time depending upon who can satisfy the rules identified by the primary judge for identifying Nguraritja   De Rose  FC  at          On the appellants  case  native title rights and interests over the claim area will not cease on the death of the last survivor among them        The present Claims are also group claims advanced by the respective applicants on behalf of groups having the memberships identified in the respective Forms   on the basis of the membership criteria identified in the respective POCs  The question is whether it is established that traditional laws and customs of the WDCB society provide for group rights and interests to be possessed by the various groups of claimants in the respective Claim areas  As will appear  I think  it has not been  I accept that the WDCB existed at sovereignty and that it still exists  The joint report of the anthropologists who participated in the conference appears to have assumed as much  But virtually everything else touching the WDCB is in issue  whether it is a society united by the acknowledgment and observance of laws and customs  its characteristics  its geographical extent  and whether the respective Claim groups continue to acknowledge its body of traditional laws and customs   a b  Geographical extent and migration Geographical coincidence  Claim areas and the WDCB    Introduction There has been a lively issue as to the western extent of the WDCB  The point of the debate is that if any of the Claim areas or parts of any of them lie west of the WDCB area  the Claims  or the Claims insofar as they relate to overlaps  must fail to that extent   since all Claims are put as dependent on the WDCB  society   The onus of establishing how far west that area extends  or  more accurately  that the Claim areas are within it  rests on the respective Claim groups  On any reckoning  the Wongatha Claim area is at the western periphery of the Western Desert  The report on the anthropologists  conference expressed the agreement of the participants that the Western and South Western boundaries of the Western Desert are  not definable based on the historical ethnographic sources   So be it  but everyone agrees that it does not extend west to the coast  It is also agreed that there are cultural continuities and that the WDCB is not distinguished by sharp boundaries  The anthropologists  joint report states that  t he relations between people who might be claimed as Western Desert or non Western Desert were not necessarily qualitatively different from relations that are intra Western Desert or intra non Western Desert  as there are likely to have been cultural continuities between those who appear on both sides of Berndt s line in the   article   I discuss the Berndt line at   ff it is one possible line that has been suggested as the western boundary of the WDCB  The difficulty of the present question is obvious  I am proceeding on the basis that the WDCB is a  society  that existed in   and continues to exist  A society is not a territory  However  the name WDCB suggests a relationship with the Western Desert  It is difficult enough to know precisely where the Western Desert begins and ends  It is even more difficult to know precisely where the geographical area occupied by the  body of persons united in and by its acknowledgment and observance of a body of law and customs    Yorta Yorta HCA at   known as the WDCB  begins and ends  Finally  it is most difficult of all to know precisely where that area began and ended in   and at various times since then  There have been population shifts since first contact  and  in particular  since settlement  Did the  migrants  take the western boundary of the WDCB to the west with them  Or  did they leave the area of the WDCB for places west of it  Again  did they simply move from one place within the WDCB area to another place within that area citedMembers of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria   FCA         FCR

existence  including the continued existence  ie non extinguishment  of native title rests on applicants  Ward FCAFC at   Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria   FCA         FCR   at     De Rose FCA O Loughlin J at   Daniel v Western Australia   FCA   at       Daniel   Neowarra at   Coe v Commonwealth   HCA         ALR    HCA  at    In saying this  I am referring to both the ultimate burden and the evidentiary burden in respect of all the elements of native title  subject to one qualification  in relation to extinguishment  a respondent bears an evidentiary burden of proving the existence of its title and of the rights exercisable under it  while the burden of proving that those rights are not inconsistent with the claimed native title rights and interests  rests on the applicants  Daniel at    In Neowarra at     under the heading  Native Title Recognition Level  Sundberg J addressed a claim that the Wanjina Wunggurr community held native title communally in the total claim area  and  that in various sub groups and as individuals they  held  various sets of rights and interests in various sub areas of  and places within  the claim area   His Honour saw nothing in the reference to the words  communal  group or individual rights and interests of Aboriginal peoples     in relation to land or waters  in s   that was an obstacle to such a claim  With respect  neither do I  In Neowarra at   ff  Sundberg J addressed a generally similar issue as it arose on the facts of that case  The State s submission to his Honour was that any rights and interests were held by people associated with the particular dambun  area of land associated with a  clan group   His Honour recorded that the State had submitted that      witnesses were asked to identify their country or their rights or interests in country  they referred to a dambun or a local site  and not to any larger region or community  A comparison may be made with the identification of a person s ngurra or  my country  area in the present case  Sundberg J adopted   the following passage from the applicants  submission as an accurate description of their case      Applicants do not claim  and the evidence does not suggest that rights do not have a dambun based focus  or that each right claimed is held equally by each and every member of the community in relation to the individual claim area  Rather it is claimed that the only entity which can and does contain all of the rights and interests in relation to the land and waters of the claim area  and all of the persons who respectively hold those rights  is the Wanjina Wunggurr Community   Sundberg J characterised   the inquiry in Ward and in Newowara under s  a  to be whether the laws and customs were those of the subgroups or of the community  His Honour referred to evidence given by indigenous witnesses demonstrating that they regarded the laws and customs as being not those of a dambun or language country  but as those of the larger community  Importantly  his Honour found      evidence does however disclose the existence of a community that transcends individual dambun or groups of dambun  and also individual language countries        His Honour noted   the evidence of the anthropologist  Dr Redmond  rejecting  the notion that the Wanjina Wunggur cultural domain is a novel creation  Sundberg J further observed   that the anthropological evidence of Dr Redmond about  clan clusters  and  families of clans  and kinship evidence was  fatal to the State s dambun based submission   asserting that no witness identified his or her country as extending beyond his or her dambun   Neowarra is distinguishable  The evidence here does not disclose the existence  under traditional laws and customs  of the Claim groups  It is not to the point that in Neowarra the claim made was a communal claim  The present Claim groups must establish the existence of themselves as right and interest possessing units within the WDCB society  What unites the Wongatha claimants is the making of the present application under the NTA  They have come together and  pooled  their claimed  my country  areas for that purpose  This is not to say that the word  Wongatha  was not in use before the present Claim was made  It was  and had been for a very long while  see    a    ff   It had various meanings  a common one being Aboriginal people in the south western part of the Western Desert  In December   or January   the Wongatha applicants chose  Wongatha  as the name of the combined Claim newly formed from   antecedent claims  none of which was called  Wongatha   All of this says nothing about the integrity of the Wongatha Claim group as an entity recognised by traditional Western Desert laws and customs  I can accept that once the integrity  in traditional terms  of a group is established  a great variety of rights and interests of members may depend upon the group native title  That variety may exist between individuals and subgroups  for example  One need only consider the special positions of watis as against all others  male against female  and adults as against children  for example  It may even be that some members do not have rights and interests in particular areas  although this may beg a semantic question as to the meaning of  rights and interests  on one view every member must have at least nominal rights and interests in the whole area by reason of nothing more than membership of the group  To take certain words from the reasons for judgment in Neowarra   the Wongatha Claim group did not  transcend  its individual members  but was a  novel creation   In their supplementary report  Pannell Vachon describe the  my country  relationship as a component of a person s identity  They also describe it as possessory in nature  establishing rights and responsibilities in relation to a particular place or area  Mr Vachon agreed that the Wongatha Claim area comprised the ngurras or  my country  areas of the individual claimants  He said that in aggregation they may not cover the entire Wongatha Claim area  but that if one were to include  the connections  the claimants  express to other parts of the Wongatha Claim area  by mother  or father  or occupation  or whatever     then that would cover pretty well the whole claim area   Even coverage of every square centimetre of the Wongatha Claim area does not remove the objection  any deficiency in coverage could always be overcome by reducing the claim area   The objection is that the coverage is by a non traditional pooling of claimed individual rights and interests over areas unique to the individual  Laws and customs which do not themselves relate to land or waters may make their contribution to proving the existence of a body or system of laws and customs  An example is the law or custom under which initiation ceremonies are performed  discussed by Sundberg J in Neowarra at    Of course  s  a  of the NTA requires that the body of laws and customs include laws and customs under which rights and interests in relation to land or waters are possessed  The Wongatha applicants must prove existence of the WDCB body or system of laws and customs in general  and of those providing for the possession of rights and interests in land or waters  in particular  Inevitably  there is an absence of direct evidence of laws and customs that existed at sovereignty and in the period from sovereignty to  first contact   I discussed  first contact  at        Generally speaking  I am prepared to infer that in   things were as they were found to be at first contact  There is  however  a question as to what this means  see       ff   There are difficult questions arising from the semi nomadic nature of indigenous life in the Western Desert until the migration and sedentarisation that followed European settlement  I would not necessarily infer  for example  from the fact that a family or families camped or hunted at a particular place in the  s  that their ancestors camped and hunted at the same place in    I would need to have further evidence before drawing that inference  The Wongatha applicants rely on the participating anthropologists  joint report  that I set out at    a    and discussed at    c iv    ff  I will not repeat that discussion here  I infer retrospectively that the characteristics of the WDCB discussed in    c  were characteristics of the WDCB in    I agree with the MN applicants that it is not fatal that some claimants live outside the MN Claim area  see Neowarra at   just as residence within that area is not  necessarily and without more  itself probative of acknowledgment and observance of laws and customs or of a connection with the Claim area under Western Desert laws and customs  The MN applicants cite the testimony of Wongatha claimant  Anthony Harris  He said that since he has gone through the law  some men at Wiluna have told him that he must look after the law ground at Leonora  because his grandfather  Jumbo Harris  used to look after it  The men were old men who used to know his grandfather  who had been dead for some     years  He said that when he goes to the Warburton Ranges or Wiluna or Jigalong  the watis are happy to see him  I accept that what the watis at Jigalong said to Anthony Harris shows that they considered that he had some kind of connection with the law ground at Leonora  However  Leonora is south of the MN Claim area  I do not see how Anthony Harris s evidence is probative of the group claim made by the MN claim group to the MN Claim area  The MN applicants attempt to show a connection  through ancestors of the MN claimants  back to sovereignty  It is true that para  b  of s   requires the connection between the claimants and the land or waters to be a connection given by pre sovereignty laws and customs  However  the connection required is a present day one  Moreover  consistently with the MN POC  the factual basis of connection is not necessarily genealogical  For example  consistently with that document  the MN Claim group might  from time to time  consist only of people who were born and grew up in the MN Claim area  The question would be whether pre sovereignty laws and customs provided for this kind of connection to yield rights and interests  In contrast to the absence of claimed area related spiritual activities in the present case  in Neowarra   Sundberg J found   that the claim group continued to practise various site related cultural practices  such as rituals  including initiation  within the claim area  Moreover  the central figures of the Wanjina were physically present on the land throughout the claim area  and Wunggurr places were identifiable locations  Sundberg J also found that the languages of the area were related to the land  in that there were  language countries  and  not merely languages spoken by people who live on the country    ibid    There is a noticeable gap between that description and even a description most favourable to the present Claims  As noted at    a b    above  according to the places of residence shown on the MN LIP  all but eight of the   members of the MN Claim group shown on the MN LIP  live outside the MN Claim area  There is no evidence that a vast majority of these persons  frequently visit     the area claimed  as the MN applicants submit  Indeed  a large number of them live in Kalgoorlie  Leonora  Cosmo  Wiluna  and  to a lesser degree  Perth  Esperance and other places within and outside Western Australia  As I have already said  residence outside the MN Claim area is not fatal to the MN Claim  but this evidence is simply not consistent with the MN applicants  submission that  very many of the claim group do reside within     the claim area       RIGHTS AND INTERESTS ASSERTED TO BE HELD UNDER TRADITIONAL LAWS AND CUSTOMS    WHETHER SUCH RIGHTS ARE  IN RELATION TO LAND AND WATERS    WHETHER SUCH RIGHTS

have an ongoing operation down to the hearing  The Amending NTA provides that s  C applies where  relevantly  the main application for a determination of native title was made either before or after the commencement  but that if it was made before the commencement  the reference in s  C to s   is a reference to s   of the Old Act  Amending NTA  s   Schedule   Pt   Item    This provision suggests that for the purposes of s  C  an application is  made  when the Form   is lodged or filed   This view is consistent with the decision of French J  in a different context  that a new application is

made at the time of the combination  but was treated by s   as a species of  amended  application  Subsection   operates as a qualification on s   which provides that an amendment of an application must not result in the inclusion of any area of land or waters that was not covered by the original application  His Honour said that  in the case of a combination of  O ld Act applications  the

applications are combined after the New NTA commenced  for the purposes of s  C b  the date  when the initial application was made  is not   September   but the date when the  initial  application was

enough  Their concern is limited to that of the area of land or waters covered by applications  Subsection  A  provides that an application may be amended at any time to reduce the area of land or waters covered by it  a sentence in the subsection provides that the subsection does not by implication limit amendment in any other way  subs   provides that an amendment must not result in the inclusion of additional land or waters  and subs   provides that if the application combines two or more claimant applications  the prohibition in subs   does not apply  No legislative purpose would be served if the subs   prohibition applied where applications  in all respects identical except as to the respective areas covered by them  are combined  because the previous applications in aggregate would have previously covered the area of the combined application  Subsections  A    and   have nothing to say  however  to amendments other than amendments to the area covered by an application  Amendments of other kinds are generally left at large by the NTA  although s   ensures that the authorisation requirement of s   applies to an amendment which changes the identity of the applicants on a claimant application  Subsection   assumes that there has been no change in the composition of the native title claim group  or  at least  does not address that situation citedTilmouth

Tilmouth   Ms Tilmouth s application concerned three separate parcels of land  all of which were within or close to the area covered by an application for a determination of native title on behalf of the Larrakia people that was already pending in the Court  Ms Tilmouth was a dissident claimant within that group  Ms Tilmouth made her application on behalf of the Yirra Bandoo  an acknowledged sub group of the Larrakia people  in competition with that of the Larrakia people  Her application was in respect of Larrakia land in relation to which the Yirra Bandoo had a special interest  O Loughlin J concluded that Ms Tilmouth s application was incompetent  His Honour relied  not upon any provisions of the NTA or of the FCRs  but on the concept of community defined in certain passages from Mabo  No   at   and Ward FCAFC at      In the passage from Mabo  No     Brennan J stated      so long as the people remain an identifiable community  the members of whom are identified by one another as members of that community living under its laws and customs  the communal native title survives to be enjoyed by the members according to the rights and interests to which they are respectively entitled under traditionally based laws and customs  as currently acknowledged and observed        O Loughlin J took his Honour s remarks to indicate that  community is a composite whole as distinct from subgroups of subsets or clans or divisions within that larger community      at    He considered that Brennan J s idea of  community  and  communal  had also been emphasised by Beaumont and von Doussa JJ in Ward FCAFC at   and    O Loughlin J concluded  at   from these passages that the smaller group  the Yirra Bandoo  could not make an application for native title  The circumstances of the present case differ from those in Tilmouth   In that case  the application on behalf of the larger group remained on foot  whereas the Strickland Nudding group s claim has supplanted that of the Maduwongga people  If the original Maduwongga Claim group actually held the particular native title claimed  its authorisation of the present Maduwongga application  on behalf of the Strickland Nudding group  would be required by the terms of s    But I am addressing the present question on the hypothesis that the Maduwongga application has not yet been heard and determined  and that it is not yet known who  if anyone  actually holds the common or group rights constituting the particular native title claimed  In these hypothetical circumstances  s   does not  in terms  require that the making of the application on behalf of the Strickland Nudding group be authorised by the original Maduwongga Claim group  Nor do I see any reason why it should be assumed against the Maduwongga applicants for the purpose  that the members of the original Maduwongga Claim group hold the particular native title claimed  The Maduwongga applicants are not pursuing the present application on behalf of that larger group  but on behalf of the smaller Strickland Nudding group citedWard v Western Australia     ALR  In Ward v Western Australia     ALR    FCA  at   Lee J stated that the preparation of genealogies  involving the distilling of information from a broad context of ethnographic material  entailed the application of the skill and expertise of anthropologists  The genealogies in evidence incorporate amendments that the anthropologists made in the light of the indigenous testimony  Like his Honour  I am satisfied as to their general reliability  The forms of the various genealogies suggested carefulness in the gathering  assembling and presentation of the data  In any event  I do not understand there to be any issue as to my reliance on them  except as to any specific instances which were the subject of evidence  an example is the controversy on the Maduwongga Claim  see Ch   over whether Albert Newland was the son  biological or adopted  of Arthur Newland    b  Weight of expert historical evidence His Honour regarded the claim in Ward as similar  and referred to what Beaumont and von Doussa JJ said in Ward FCAFC at     and    Their Honours there referred to the finding of Lee J at first instance that there was a Miriuwung and Gajerrong community that had an ancestral connection with the Aboriginal community or communities that occupied the claim area at sovereignty  Their Honours addressed the State s submission that every relevant witness had claimed to be either Miriuwung or Gajerrong  and that a great majority of the Miriuwung claimed to have a full array of rights only in an estate area  and disclaimed other estate areas as their  country   Their Honours said   that it was not necessary that each named applicant establish that he or she possessed rights and interests uniformly over the entire determination area  They referred to the primary judge s finding that the two communities  Miriuwung and Gajerrong  once acknowledged and recognised separate territories  but had in more recent times become regarded  amongst themselves  as a composite community with shared interests  They thought that conclusion to be in accordance with the evidence citedWestern Australia v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html   The common law concept of  native title   recognised in Mabo

for registration under the New NTA and entered in the Register of Native Title Claims  On   November   however  Carr J ordered that the NT Registrar s decision made on   February   be set aside  see Western Australia v Native Title Registrar   FCA    On   February   the Wongatha Claim was again accepted for registration  at that time the then current Wongatha Form   was dated   November    On

amended application dated   April   and filed on   April   which is discussed at       below  On   July   Carr J made orders as a result of which proceeding WAG   was consolidated with WAG    The consolidated proceeding was to be called  WG   of   and   of    On   February   on the motion of the applicants in the consolidated proceeding  RD Nicholson J revoked Carr J s consolidation order and ordered that both WAG   and WAG   be combined with WAG   and continue in and under WAG   of    The form of application in WAG   was amended accordingly  For convenience  I am calling the combined proceeding  WAG    the Maduwongga Claim  except where it is necessary to distinguish between the various claims bearing the name  Maduwongga   It is important to note  however  that whereas the first  second and thirty third claims listed in Annexure B were expressed to be made on behalf of  all those persons who are Maduwongga peoples  the Maduwongga application is now made on behalf of only  Marjorie May Strickland and Anne Joyce Nudding and their biological descendants   the Strickland Nudding group   Because the Wongatha Claim was asserted to be made on behalf of some individuals who were claimants on the original Cosmo Claim  the Cosmo Claim was doomed to fail the new registration test  as it offended s  C  of the NTA  which had been introduced by the Amending NTA  Accordingly  on   May   the NT Registrar decided not to accept for registration the then Cosmo application as amended  However  the decision to register the Wongatha Claim was itself set aside on   November   by Carr J  on the ground that the NT Registrar had not observed the requirements of procedural fairness in making that decision  Soon afterwards  on   November   the present Cosmo applicant  Harvey Murray  replacing the original   named Cosmo applicants  filed a further re amended native title determination application  which was amended on   November   pursuant to Court order  and which included in Schedule A  a provision that  to avoid any doubt  the claimant group does not include any person who is a claimant in WC   WAG    The Wongatha Claim   The NT Registrar determined that this provision in Schedule A satisfied s  C  of the NTA and the Cosmo Claim was registered on   December    Following the order made on   November   setting aside the Registrar s decision to register the Wongatha Claim  the Wongatha Form   was also amended and the Wongatha Claim was accepted for registration on   February    On   July   Carr J ordered that the first two Maduwongga applications  WC    WAG   and WC    WAG   be consolidated and be conducted as one proceeding  having the Court number  WAG   of   and   of    In a statement filed by the applicants in WAG   on   August   pursuant to para   of directions made by Carr J on   September   the Maduwongga applicants stated that the application was made on behalf of Ms Strickland  Ms Nudding and Albert Newland  the first two as biological descendants of Kitty Bluegum  and Mr Newland as a  Descendant of Kitty Bluegum  either biological and or adopted son of Arthur Newland  together with their  all three s  descendants  and also the descendants of Gertrude Morrison  deceased  as set out in Figure     of an anthropological report of McDonald Hales and Associates dated August    Dr McDonald s report   Arthur Newland was the biological son of Kitty Bluegum and biological father of Ms Strickland and Ms Nudding  Figure     showed the descendants of Gertrude Morrison to include Phillip O Donoghue and Donald Ballinger  and the children and grandchildren of these two men  On   January   the Maduwongga applicants filed in WAG   a notice of motion seeking an order that Maduwonggas     and   be  combined  and that the combined application take the form of an Amended Native Title Determination Claimant Application  Form   annexed to a supporting affidavit of Dianne Baruffi sworn   January    Importantly  that Form   while continuing to designate Ms Strickland and Ms Nudding as applicants and stating that the claim was a combination of the claims in WC    WAG   WC    WAG   and WC    WAG   asserted that the application was now brought on behalf of  the Strickland Nudding group  rather than  the Maduwongga peoples   Accordingly  the Maduwongga Claim group was to be substantially reduced in scope This radical reduction in the Maduwongga Claim group from  the Maduwongga Peoples  to  the Strickland Nudding group  was the first change to be made following the enactment of the Amending NTA  The Commonwealth submits that the substitution of the new reduced native title claim group was contrary to the NTA  that the Maduwongga applicants were not authorised to make the new application  and that the present Maduwongga Claim group  the Strickland Nudding group  having the two Maduwongga applicants themselves as its apical ancestors  is not a group capable of holding native title  see     below   On   February   RD Nicholson J ordered that the consolidation order made by Carr J on   July   be revoked and that applications WAG   and WAG   be deconsolidated  that application WAG   be amended so as to be combined with and include applications WAG   and WAG   that those three applications be combined and continue under application WAG   and that application WAG   be amended to take the form of Form   annexed to Ms Baruffi s affidavit of   January   mentioned above  No doubt pursuant to s   of the NTA  the Registrar of this Court gave a copy of that Form   to the NT Registrar  In the NNTT  the combined application  WAG   was given the number WC    Leave to amend the Maduwongga Form   further was sought by notices of motion dated   March   and   April    On   April   the District Registrar directed that the Maduwongga application be amended to take the form of the Form   annexed to a further affidavit of Ms Baruffi  sworn and filed   April   and that the Maduwongga applicants file and serve a fresh amended application incorporating all amendments within   days  Such a document was filed on   April    It is this combined Maduwongga application as subsequently amended that is the Maduwongga Claim now before the Court  The combined Maduwongga Claim again stated that the claim was brought on behalf of the Strickland Nudding group  Reference to the  Maduwongga  or  Maduwongga Peoples  was omitted  and reference was made  for example  to the  traditional laws and customs of the claim group  now necessarily a reference to the traditional laws and customs of Ms Strickland and Ms Nudding and their biological descendants  For convenience  I continue to use the designation  Maduwongga  to refer to this Claim  but it must be remembered that as from   February   the Maduwongga Claim group is in fact the Strickland Nudding group  Curiously  in a further statement filed by the Maduwongga applicants on   May   pursuant to Carr J s directions of   September   the group membership was stated as being exactly the same as it had been in the statement filed on   August    see   above  notwithstanding the narrower definition of the Maduwongga group as the Strickland Nudding group that had intervened in the amended Forms   of January February and April     a  The Maduwongga Claim group According to Dr McDonald s report  written in August   prior to the reduction in the Maduwongga Claim group of January February   down to the Strickland Nudding group  the Maduwongga Claim group comprised   living persons  while the narrower Strickland Nudding group can be seen from that report to have comprised only   living persons  The genealogy in the report shows Albert Newland as an adopted brother of Ms Strickland and Ms Nudding  In a Maduwongga LIP dated   April   and filed in this present Wongatha proceeding on   April   Albert Newland s name no longer appears  This document lists   individuals as members of the Maduwongga Claim group  that is to say  of the Strickland Nudding group  However  they include Albert Nudding  who is the husband of Ms Nudding  He is not a biological descendant even of Kitty Bluegum  and it is not suggested that he is  Maduwongga   The   individuals also include the two fostered adopted grandchildren of Ms Nudding  However  they do not include Christine Newland  who is a sibling of Ms Strickland and Ms Nudding  and  on one view  of Albert Newland too  The Maduwongga applicants now say that this document  which is the Maduwongga LIP on which they went to trial  is to be  ignored   I discuss the problematical composition of the Maduwongga group further in Ch    This Maduwongga LIP divides the   persons named in it into two groups according to the basis of their membership of the Maduwongga Claim group  The first basis is      cognatic descent from Kitty Bluegum and her father Johnny        conception and birth in Maduwongga country        identification as Maduwongga   following the Wonggai way  and       continuing traditional connection to Maduwongga country        The second basis is      identification as Maduwongga   following the Wonggai way  and       continuing traditional connection to Maduwongga country  I accept that the early records made by European amateur and professional ethnographers are limited by the ethnocentric views of the writers and by the limits on their understanding of the language and culture of those about whom they wrote  see Daniel at   where RD Nicholson J recognised this point    Mr Muller Groups  B F make a detailed attack on the qualifications and testimony of Mr Muller  He was cross examined in relation to his experience  His work in relation to Australian Aboriginal history has been substantially confined to the period since   during most of which he has been employed full time by the GLSC in the preparation of his reports for this proceeding  He had no academic training in Australian history except at high school  The State submits that while there was a good deal of controversy over the completeness of the research of both historians  overall there was significant agreement in their descriptions of the past  I agree  The Cosmo applicant submits that Mr Muller should be preferred to Mr Stronach  especially on the early explorers  Mr Stronach dealt with them only briefly  no doubt because he did not take issue with Mr Muller s account  Mr Muller was criticised by Group  B F for not having examined in any detail material produced by the anthropologists  Daisy Bates  Professors Norman B Tindale and AP Elkin  and Professor RM and Dr CH Berndt  The reason he gave in his report is that  t his is not the author s area of expertise  and other experts have examined this material   In cross examination  he said he had been instructed  in effect  to  stand clear  of anthropological material  which  he understood  would be addressed by others retained by the GLSC  The GLSC submission in reply suggest that this was an appropriate stance for a non anthropologist to take  The MN applicants make two submissions in relation to the meaning of  connection  in s  b  of the NTA  but in my view  for the reasons the evidence does not satisfy s  a  of the NTA  it does not show that the MN Claim group  by WDCB laws and customs has a connection with the Wongatha MN overlap for the purposes of s  b  of the NTA  First  they correctly point out that in Ward HCA   the joint judgment does not exclude the possibility that a  spiritual connection  may suffice    No submissions were made to the High Court on that issue  and their Honours did not need to express a view on it  In Daniel   after noting this  RD Nicholson J  said       there is evidence of continuing use and  in the case of the Ngarluma  of physical presence accompanied in each case by an enduring sense of connection which I take to fall within the description of spiritual connection  I take spiritual connection into account along with the evidence of continuing use and physical presence        It seems to me that para  b  of s   of the NTA is emphasising the need for a special connection between the claimants and the particular land or waters that are the subject of their claim  different from the connection which all Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders may have in relation to land or waters  This does not exclude the possibility of a  spiritual  connection  but the spiritual connection must be between the claimants and the particular land or waters which they claim  or particular sites  tracks or places there  Second  the MN applicants submit      for the purposes of NTA s  b  can be made out by having regard to  amongst other evidence  evidence of activities on  or knowledge about  areas outside the boundaries of the claim areas  This aspect is particularly pertinent in this case  where all four of the GLSC claim groups rely upon a common background of descent from  and membership in  the WDCB which operated in times past  and operates today  in large areas adjacent to  and including  the claim areas before the Court          for example  law business in Warburton or Wiluna involving members of one or more of the GLSC claim groups may  as a matter of law  be very relevant and probative evidence of observance and acknowledgement of relevant laws and customs by  and of connection thereby to the claimed areas on the part of  such members and  accordingly  such claim groups        If an MN claimant is initiated at Warburton that may show that he is acknowledging and observing a traditional Western Desert law or custom requiring that all males be initiated  The evidence would play its part in establishing  a  that the WDCB society continues  and  b  that the MN Claim group continues to acknowledge and observe WDCB laws and customs  There would be a question of why the person was not initiated within the MN Claim area  but that is another matter citedWestern
