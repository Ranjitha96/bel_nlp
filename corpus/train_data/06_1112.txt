Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate No     FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedACD Tridon v Tridon Australia   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  htmlComandate Marine argued that the making of a choice between having disputes determined by arbitration or curially was not an election by a party to an arbitration agreement  It relied on what Austin J had said in ACD Tridon v Tridon Australia   NSWSC   at          He held that mere delay in invoking a reference to arbitration by a party to an arbitration agreement  who had been sued by the other party in curial proceedings  was not an election or waiver  see too Australian Granites Ltd v Eisenwerk Hensel Bayreuth Dipl ing Burkhardt GmbH     Qd R   at      But that is quite distinct from the position  here  where the party asserting the binding obligation to arbitrate later initiated the Boomerang I  s arrest without  at that time  seeking or foreshadowing a claim for curial assistance in those proceedings in enforcing the arbitration agreement discussedAllergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    As noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s interpretation  Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter Sanders  the Dutch delegate in the drafting of the Convention

 which is kept  without contestation by the party    UN DOC E CONF   L       The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected  van den Berg  op cit at   Kaplan  op cit      Earlier  as Kaplan J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in James Buchanan   Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping  UK  Ltd   AC   at   and see too  Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     per Kennedy J  Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice

that case  similarly  a consent arbitration was proceeding at the time the vessel was arrested  Again  there is no indication in the report of the claims made in the writ in consequence of which the vessel was arrested  However  his Honour set out what Sheen J had said and concluded that the same approach should be adopted in the construction of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth    FCR at    He continued       In my opinion the use of the words   should be determined by arbitration  has nothing to say on the question whether the arbitration has already commenced or is to commence in the future  As Sheen J and Sheppard J reasoned  the enactment of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  and its analogue permit the arrest of a vessel so that security will be available to satisfy any award made in an arbitration proceeding which the parties to the writ  when the defendant appears  are contractually bound to submit to arbitration or have already begun to arbitrate  But such an arrest  in my opinion can only be justified if the relief sought from the Court is not inconsistent with the obligation to arbitrate  Comandate Marine submitted that its dominant  but not sole  purpose in bringing the proceedings in rem was to seek security for the arbitration  It said that if the Court did not stay the proceedings or refer them to arbitration  the proceedings would continue  Thus  the Court could grant the actual and only relief sought in the writ  namely the arrest which was made and damages  interest and costs citedAustralian Granites Ltd v Eisenwerk Hensel Bayreuth Dipl ing Burkhardt GmbH     Qd R  Comandate Marine argued that the making of a choice between having disputes determined by arbitration or curially was not an election by a party to an arbitration agreement  It relied on what Austin J had said in ACD Tridon v Tridon Australia   NSWSC   at          He held that mere delay in invoking a reference to arbitration by a party to an arbitration agreement  who had been sued by the other party in curial proceedings  was not an election or waiver  see too Australian Granites Ltd v Eisenwerk Hensel Bayreuth Dipl ing Burkhardt GmbH     Qd R   at      But that is quite distinct from the position  here  where the party asserting the binding obligation to arbitrate later initiated the Boomerang I  s arrest without  at that time  seeking or foreshadowing a claim for curial assistance in those proceedings in enforcing the arbitration agreement  Ordinarily  an arbitration agreement will give rise to the Court holding the parties to an exclusive procedure to be followed by both parties for the resolution of any dispute to which the agreement applies  PMT Partners Pty Ltd  In liq  v Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service   HCA         CLR   at

Traffic Authority   HCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAs noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler

Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention

Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

such as  waiver   and acquiescence and estoppel  are confusing and imprecise  This was pointed out by Dawson J in Verwayen   HCA         CLR   at   and Lord Browne Wilkinson in Roebuck v Mungovin     AC   at      See also Giumelli v Giumelli   HCA         CLR   at        The conduct of pending proceedings by a party is relevant upon an application by that party for the exercise in its favour of a power of the court  The outcome of such an application depends not upon the exercise of the right of a litigant or upon its denial  but upon the exercise of a discretionary power given to the court  The decision of the court often will depend upon many different factors  see Ketteman v Hansel Properties   AC   at   per Lord Griffiths   An outcome favourable to one party cannot be described adequately in terms of the waiver of the legal  equitable or statutory rights of the unsuccessful party    emphasis added Again  their Honours were dealing an argument about waiver by a defendant to proceedings which  at the first opportunity  had not taken a point open to it to say that the proceedings were incompetent  As the words emphasised show  the issue there was as to the legal consequence of conduct of a party in proceedings which were already pending  as distinct from the consequences which might result the conduct of from a person who exercises a choice by commencing curial proceedings followedButt v M Donald     QLJ  As noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s interpretation  Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter Sanders  the Dutch delegate in the drafting of the Convention  who had given him the actual minutes of the delegate s consideration of Prof Sanders  proposal to add to the draft of Art II r   the following words       Confirmation in writing by one of the parties  which is kept  without contestation by the party    UN DOC E CONF   L       The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected  van den Berg  op cit at   Kaplan  op cit      Earlier  as Kaplan J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in James Buchanan   Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping  UK  Ltd   AC   at   and see too  Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     per Kennedy J  Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

      CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAs noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s interpretation  Mr Kaplan referred to discussions

delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected  van den Berg  op cit at   Kaplan  op cit      Earlier  as Kaplan J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting

application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

cases cth HCA  htmlAs noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v

 DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s interpretation  Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter

Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in

Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice

Comandate Marine knew of the provisions of cl  b  requiring all disputes arising out of the contract to be arbitrated at the time of the issue of its writ in rem  By seeking only the relief which it did in the writ in rem  Comandate Marine communicated  unequivocally  in my opinion  a choice that it was litigating in this Court an action for damages for breach of the charter party  Of course  the Court could give relief in that action  No relief was sought in aid of the arbitration  In the classic judgment of Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch   at      in a passage approved by Knox CJ  Isaacs and Starke JJ in Craine v Colonial Mutual Fire Insurance Co Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    their Honours  emphasis  said       It is also  I think  reasonably clear upon the cases that whether the act  coupled with the knowledge  constitutes a waiver is a question which the law decides   and therefore it is not open to a lessor who has knowledge of the breach to say  I will treat the tenancy as existing  and I will receive the rent  or I will take advantage of my power as landlord to distrain  but I tell you that all I shall do will be without prejudice to my right to re enter  which I intend to reserve   That is a position which he is not entitled to take up  If  knowing of the breach   he does distrain  or does receive the rent  then by law he waives the breach  and nothing which he can say by way of protest against the law will avail him anything  citedD Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAs noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s interpretation  Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter

Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in James Buchanan   Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping  UK  Ltd   AC   at   and see too  Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     per Kennedy J  Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice

 http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedElbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlAs noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no

at   Kaplan  op cit      Earlier  as Kaplan J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v

    It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice

 http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedEmpirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR  As noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van

J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in James Buchanan   Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping  UK  Ltd   AC   at   and see too  Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     per Kennedy J  Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it

Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s interpretation  Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter Sanders  the Dutch delegate in the drafting of the Convention  who had given him the actual minutes of the delegate s consideration of Prof Sanders  proposal to add to the draft of Art II r   the following words       Confirmation in writing by one of the parties  which is kept  without contestation by the party    UN DOC E CONF   L       The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected  van den Berg  op cit at   Kaplan  op cit      Earlier  as Kaplan J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in

Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice

 http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldiscussedFrancis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR  As noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is

J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in James Buchanan   Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping  UK  Ltd   AC   at   and see too  Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     per Kennedy J  Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar

choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written

    It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice

election to the other party in clear and unequivocal terms  An election arises when a party is confronted with and makes a choice between the exercise of alternative and inconsistent rights  The party is not obliged to elect at once  but when it takes a step which is consistent only with one of those rights the law attributes to it an election to abandon the other right   CLR at pp      It is necessary  however  for the party alleged to have elected  to have been aware at least of the facts giving rise to the two courses of action   CLR at    As their Honours pointed out   CLR at        The true nature of election is brought out in this sentence from the seminal work of Spencer Bower and Turner  The Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation   rd ed   p    It is of the essence of election that the party electing shall be  confronted  with two mutually exclusive courses of action between which he must  in fairness to the other party  make his choice  consideredIncitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlAs noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at

per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s

held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in James Buchanan   Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping  UK  Ltd   AC   at   and see too  Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     per Kennedy J  Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty

Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom

during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no

at   Kaplan  op cit      Earlier  as Kaplan J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an

said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in James Buchanan   Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping  UK  Ltd   AC   at

    It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares    Associate Dated    August   Counsel for the Plaintiff  Dr AS Bell with Mr S Free     Solicitor for the Plaintiff  Ebsworth   Ebsworth     Counsel for the Defendant  Mr AW Street SC with Mr NJ

 http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedKatagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR  As noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s interpretation  Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter Sanders  the Dutch delegate in the drafting of the Convention  who had given him the actual minutes of the delegate s

UN DOC E CONF   L       The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected  van den Berg  op cit at   Kaplan  op cit      Earlier  as Kaplan J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in James Buchanan   Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping  UK  Ltd   AC   at   and see too  Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     per Kennedy J  Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

the Admiralty jurisdiction of the Court  including all its powers under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   It says that the arrest of the Boomerang I has been set aside  and so no question now arises about an order under s   in the proceedings which it commenced  But it says that had the vessel remained under arrest  the court could have granted a stay and made orders for security under s   discussedHi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR  As noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention

Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting

Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

cases cth HCA  htmlAs noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v

 DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with

following words       Confirmation in writing by one of the parties  which is kept  without contestation by the party    UN DOC E CONF   L       The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected  van den Berg  op cit at   Kaplan  op cit      Earlier  as Kaplan J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in

Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice

htmlAs noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v

 DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s interpretation  Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter

Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in

Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated

China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice

 http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedMatthews v Smallwood     Ch  There can be no doubt that Comandate Marine knew of the provisions of cl  b  requiring all disputes arising out of the contract to be arbitrated at the time of the issue of its writ in rem  By seeking only the relief which it did in the writ in rem  Comandate Marine communicated  unequivocally  in my opinion  a choice that it was litigating in this Court an action for damages for breach of the charter party  Of course  the Court could give relief in that action  No relief was sought in aid of the arbitration  In the classic judgment of Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch   at      in a passage approved by Knox CJ  Isaacs and Starke JJ in Craine v Colonial Mutual Fire Insurance Co Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    their Honours  emphasis  said       It is also  I think  reasonably clear upon the cases that whether the act  coupled with the knowledge  constitutes a waiver is a question which the law decides   and therefore it is not open to a lessor who has knowledge of the breach to say  I will treat the tenancy as existing  and I will receive the rent  or I will take advantage of my power as landlord to distrain  but I tell you that all I shall do will be without prejudice to my right to re enter  which I intend to reserve   That is a position which he is not entitled to take up  If  knowing of the breach   he does distrain  or does receive the rent  then by law he waives the breach  and nothing which he can say by way of protest against the law will avail him anything  As noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s interpretation  Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter Sanders  the Dutch delegate in the drafting of the Convention  who had given him the actual minutes of the delegate s consideration of Prof Sanders  proposal to add to the draft of Art II r   the following words       Confirmation in writing by one of the parties  which is kept  without contestation by the party    UN DOC E CONF   L       The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected  van den Berg  op cit at   Kaplan  op cit      Earlier  as Kaplan J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in

Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice

 http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedMitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US      As noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s

held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in James Buchanan   Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping  UK  Ltd   AC   at   and see too  Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     per Kennedy J  Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied

  International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty

Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

htmlAs noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with

Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until

requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s interpretation  Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter Sanders  the Dutch delegate in the drafting of the Convention  who had given him the actual minutes of the delegate s

UN DOC E CONF   L       The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected  van den Berg  op cit at   Kaplan  op cit      Earlier  as Kaplan J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in James Buchanan   Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping  UK  Ltd   AC   at   and see too  Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     per Kennedy J  Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim

Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAs noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s

held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA

this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no

 which is kept  without contestation by the party    UN DOC E CONF   L       The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected  van den Berg  op cit at   Kaplan  op cit      Earlier  as Kaplan J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in James Buchanan   Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping  UK  Ltd   AC   at   and see too  Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     per Kennedy J  Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice

 http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedPaper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR  As noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s

UN DOC E CONF   L       The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected  van den Berg  op cit at   Kaplan  op cit      Earlier  as Kaplan J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in James Buchanan   Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping  UK  Ltd   AC   at   and see too  Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     per Kennedy J  Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

cases cth HCA  htmlAs noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s interpretation  Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter Sanders  the Dutch delegate in the drafting of the Convention  who had given him the actual minutes of the delegate s consideration of Prof Sanders  proposal to add to the draft of Art II r   the following words       Confirmation in writing by one of the parties  which is kept  without contestation by the party    UN DOC E CONF   L       The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected  van den Berg  op cit at   Kaplan  op cit      Earlier  as Kaplan J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in James Buchanan   Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping  UK  Ltd   AC   at   and see too  Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     per Kennedy J  Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice

Jute Textile Co Ltd   VSCA   at       per Chernov JA with whom Ashley JA and Bongiorno AJA agreed citedProctor v Schellenberg     WWR  As noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van

J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in James Buchanan   Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping  UK  Ltd   AC   at   and see too  Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     per Kennedy J  Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it

exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written

convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v

    It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until

Boomerang   proceedings in rem was to put before the Court all elements of the justiciable controversy between the parties to  initially  the in rem proceedings  and  later  the in personam proceedings  Once Pan had appeared  the single controversy between it and Comandate Marine could be litigated in those proceedings  or indeed  in both proceedings as Gummow and Hayne JJ made clear in Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at      see too at            They said   CLR at          What is a single controversy  depends on what the parties have done  the relationships between or among them and the laws which attach rights or liabilities to their conduct and relationship    Fencott   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason  Murphy  Brennan and Deane JJ   There is but a single matter if different claims arise out of  common transactions and facts  or  a common substratum of facts    Philip Morris   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J  notwithstanding that the facts upon which the claims depend  do not wholly coincide    Fencott   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J  Murphy  Brennan and Deane JJ    As noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van

J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in James Buchanan   Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping  UK  Ltd   AC   at   and see too  Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     per Kennedy J  Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

Hope of Craighead agreed and s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  citedRobobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX  As noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y

invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is

is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim

 US      As noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v

 DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with

Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in

Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice

htmlAs noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s interpretation  Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter Sanders  the Dutch delegate in the drafting of the Convention  who had given him the actual minutes of the delegate s consideration of Prof Sanders  proposal to add to the draft of Art II r   the following words       Confirmation in writing by one of the parties  which is kept  without contestation by the party    UN DOC E CONF   L       The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected  van den Berg  op cit at   Kaplan  op cit      Earlier  as Kaplan J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in James Buchanan   Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping  UK  Ltd   AC   at   and see too  Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     per Kennedy J  Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice

above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v

 DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s interpretation  Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter

following words       Confirmation in writing by one of the parties  which is kept  without contestation by the party    UN DOC E CONF   L       The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected  van den Berg  op cit at   Kaplan  op cit      Earlier  as Kaplan J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in

Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice

 http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedSydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR  As noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s

UN DOC E CONF   L       The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected  van den Berg  op cit at   Kaplan  op cit      Earlier  as Kaplan J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in James Buchanan   Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping  UK  Ltd   AC   at   and see too  Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     per Kennedy J  Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

HCA  htmlAs noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v

 DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract

in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s interpretation  Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter Sanders  the Dutch delegate in the drafting of the Convention  who had given him the actual minutes of the delegate s consideration of Prof Sanders  proposal to add to the draft of Art II r   the following words       Confirmation in writing by one of the parties  which is kept  without contestation by the party    UN DOC E CONF   L       The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected  van den Berg  op cit at   Kaplan  op cit      Earlier  as Kaplan J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in James Buchanan   Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping  UK  Ltd   AC   at   and see too  Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     per Kennedy J  Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice

 http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredThe   Andria  now renamed   Vasso    QB  Comandate Marine relied upon two authorities  one English and one in this Court in support of its position  In The   Jalamatsya      Lloyd s Rep   Sheen J held that a party to arbitration proceedings which had already been commenced could apply to the Court for the arrest of a vessel in order to obtain security for the arbitration  His Lordship noted that s   of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act    UK  which is in relevantly similar terms to s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  for present purposes  envisaged just such a course  He relied on obiter dicta by Robert Goff LJ  giving the judgment of himself  Waller and Slade LJJ in The   Andria  now renamed   Vasso    QB       Lloyd s Rep   to that effect  Sheen J said that s   had been enacted           to enable claimants  I use a neutral expression  to obtain security if they proceeded by way of arbitration rather than by action  In my judgment s   applies whether or not an arbitration has already been commenced  It follows that if an arbitration has been commenced  and if the claimants in the arbitration have not obtained security for any possible award  then they can quite properly issue a writ in rem if they know that a ship belonging to the respondents in the arbitration is coming within the jurisdiction  and they may arrest that ship in order to obtain security       Lloyd s Rep at  What s   is referring to is the question whether the dispute should be determined by arbitration in the sense that that is the appropriate method whereby the dispute between the parties is to be resolved  There is an issue about that in this case  In The   Andria  now renamed   Vasso    QB   at   Waller  Slade and Robert Goff LJJ said  that in English law as it stood prior to the enactment of s            the Court s jurisdiction to arrest a ship in an action in rem should not be exercised for the purposes of providing security for an award which may be made in arbitration proceedings  That is simply because the purpose of the exercise of the jurisdiction is to provide security in respect of the action in rem  and not to provide security in some other proceedings  for example  arbitration proceedings  The time may well come when the law on this point may be changed  see s   of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act   which has however not be brought into force  But that is not yet the law  It follows that  if a plaintiff invokes the jurisdiction of the Court to obtain the arrest of a ship as security for an award in arbitration proceedings  the Court should not issue a warrant of arrest  citedThe  Bazias     QB  In The  Bazias     QB   Lloyd LJ  with whom Ralph Gibson and Butler Sloss LJJ agreed  granted a stay of proceedings brought in admiralty in order to enable arbitration to proceed but continued the arrest of two vessels under s   in order to provide security for any award in the arbitration  Significantly  his Lordship recited that the proceedings in rem sought security for the plaintiff s counterclaim in the arbitration proceedings  see   QB at  G H and see also the recital of facts at  C D  consideredThe  Cap Bon      Lloyd s Rep  Earlier  their Lordships identified the issue as arising in the context of an argument about jurisdiction and abuse of process  They rejected the contention that if the purpose of a plaintiff in seeking the arrest of a ship in an action in rem was simply to obtain security for an award in arbitration proceedings  the court had no jurisdiction   QB at  E G   Rather they held that in such a case  before s   came into force  the plaintiff s conduct was an abuse of process   QB at  E G  but said  obiter dicta   that once s   came into force it would be a permissible course  They also cited   QB at  B  Brandon J s decision in The  Cap Bon      Lloyd s Rep    see at   as authority for the proposition that a party who actively pursued proceedings in respect of the same claim both in the Court and in arbitration  could be required by the Court  in the exercise of its inherent power  to elect in which forum it would pursue its claim because the Court proceedings could be regarded as vexatious or an abuse of process  Brandon J observed that the plaintiff had a right to do either     Lloyd s Rep at   see too  The  Tuyuti    QB   at   where Robert Goff LJ referred to this approach as a principle of law   Neither the Lords Justices  nor Brandon J  considered the question of whether the party by so acting may have elected between or waived its right to pursue one rather than the other course citedThe  Epsilon Rosa      Lloyd s Rep   at  As noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s

held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in James Buchanan   Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping  UK  Ltd   AC   at   and see too  Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     per Kennedy J  Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

one in this Court in support of its position  In The   Jalamatsya      Lloyd s Rep   Sheen J held that a party to arbitration proceedings which had already been commenced could apply to the Court for the arrest of a vessel in order to obtain security for the arbitration  His Lordship noted that s   of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act    UK  which is in relevantly similar terms to s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  for present purposes  envisaged just such a course  He relied on obiter dicta by Robert Goff LJ  giving the judgment of himself  Waller and Slade LJJ in The   Andria  now renamed   Vasso    QB       Lloyd s Rep   to that effect  Sheen J said that s   had been enacted           to enable claimants  I use a neutral expression  to obtain security if they proceeded by way of arbitration rather than by action  In my judgment s   applies whether or not an arbitration has already been commenced  It follows that if an arbitration has been commenced  and if the claimants in the arbitration have not obtained security for any possible award  then they can quite properly issue a writ in rem if they know that a ship belonging to the respondents in the arbitration is coming within the jurisdiction  and they may arrest that ship in order to obtain security       Lloyd s Rep at  discussedThe  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep  As noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s interpretation  Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter Sanders  the Dutch delegate in the drafting of the Convention  who had given him the actual minutes of the

party    UN DOC E CONF   L       The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected  van den Berg  op cit at   Kaplan  op cit      Earlier  as Kaplan J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in James Buchanan   Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping  UK  Ltd   AC   at   and see too  Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     per Kennedy J  Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

argument about jurisdiction and abuse of process  They rejected the contention that if the purpose of a plaintiff in seeking the arrest of a ship in an action in rem was simply to obtain security for an award in arbitration proceedings  the court had no jurisdiction   QB at  E G   Rather they held that in such a case  before s   came into force  the plaintiff s conduct was an abuse of process   QB at  E G  but said  obiter dicta   that once s   came into force it would be a permissible course  They also cited   QB at  B  Brandon J s decision in The  Cap Bon      Lloyd s Rep    see at   as authority for the proposition that a party who actively pursued proceedings in respect of the same claim both in the Court and in arbitration  could be required by the Court  in the exercise of its inherent power  to elect in which forum it would pursue its claim because the Court proceedings could be regarded as vexatious or an abuse of process  Brandon J observed that the plaintiff had a right to do either     Lloyd s Rep at   see too  The  Tuyuti    QB   at   where Robert Goff LJ referred to this approach as a principle of law   Neither the Lords Justices  nor Brandon J  considered the question of whether the party by so acting may have elected between or waived its right to pursue one rather than the other course  As noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is

J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in James Buchanan   Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping  UK  Ltd   AC   at   and see too  Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     per Kennedy J  Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it

Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

htmlIt would not be inconsistent for a party to an arbitration agreement seeking to enforce its rights in an arbitration to commence in rem proceedings in which it claimed relief under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  so as to have security available to satisfy any arbitral award  And  as Allsop J has remarked  it is important to recognize that impediments should not be placed in the path of the free use of the in rem procedure under the Admiralty Act    Cth  Tisand v The  Cape Moreton    FCA         FCR   at       In the present case  where the arbitration has commenced and Comandate Marine wishes to enforce the obligations of the parties to arbitrate  it could have commenced in rem proceedings seeking an order under s   that they be stayed or dismissed on the ground that Pan was bound to arbitrate in London after Pan provided security  Comandate Marine invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to hear and determine a case for damages for breach of the charter party by seeking in its writ in rem only the arrest and damages and made no claim for security or to enforce the obligation to arbitrate  Indeed  Comandate Marine submitted that while its dominant purpose in commencing its proceedings in rem was to obtain security for the arbitration  it also intended to pursue the relief it claimed in that writ of stay of Pan s proceedings were refused  That submission sought to keep all Comandate Marine s options open without prejudice  Comandate Marine also pointed to Art   of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration which by force of s   and the International Arbitration Act    Cth  has the force of law in Australia  The Model Law is set out in Sch   of that Act  Article   of the Model Law provides       It is not incompatible with an arbitration agreement for a party to request  before or during arbitral proceedings  from a court an interim measure of protection and for a court to grant such measure  appliedTravel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAs noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s interpretation  Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter Sanders  the Dutch delegate in the drafting of the Convention  who had given him the actual minutes of the delegate s

UN DOC E CONF   L       The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected  van den Berg  op cit at   Kaplan  op cit      Earlier  as Kaplan J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in James Buchanan   Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping  UK  Ltd   AC   at   and see too  Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     per Kennedy J  Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  the  Evje    AC  As noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention

delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected  van den Berg  op cit at   Kaplan  op cit      Earlier  as Kaplan J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting

Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

JA with whom Ashley JA and Bongiorno AJA agreed  As noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s interpretation  Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter Sanders  the Dutch delegate in the drafting of the Convention  who had given him the actual minutes of the delegate s consideration of Prof Sanders  proposal to add to the draft of Art II r   the following words       Confirmation in writing by one of the parties  which is kept  without contestation by the party    UN DOC E CONF   L       The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected  van den Berg  op cit at   Kaplan  op cit      Earlier  as Kaplan J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in James Buchanan   Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping  UK  Ltd   AC   at   and see too  Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     per Kennedy J  Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim

 htmlAs noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s interpretation  Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter Sanders  the Dutch delegate in the drafting of the Convention  who had given him the actual minutes of the delegate s consideration of Prof Sanders  proposal to add to the draft of Art II r   the following words       Confirmation in writing by one of the parties  which is kept  without contestation by the party    UN DOC E CONF   L       The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected  van den Berg  op cit at   Kaplan  op cit      Earlier  as Kaplan J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in James Buchanan   Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping  UK  Ltd   AC   at   and see too  Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     per Kennedy J  Renquist CJ  Scalia  Souter  Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to

which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the

occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice

 http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldiscussedWalter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlAs noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute    Russell on Arbitration   nd ed  at    A    refers to Art   having the same effect as English law  i e  the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v Alberto Culver Co   US       Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at   per Brennan and Dawson JJ    per Toohey J agreeing  cf  Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F C R S  Shipping Ltd     DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s interpretation  Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter

Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in

China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice

Ltd     Lloyd s Rep  As noted above  Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem contained no such request  And  Art   of the Model Law  relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration  if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute

a stay of the proceedings  op cit at        The position is similar under s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  which applies here by force of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court  I am of opinion that Comandate Marine s conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement  and that Art   and Art   of the Model Law do not avail it  Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood     Ch at      By pleading the writ in the way which it did  Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act    Cth  to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s  f  of the Admiralty Act    Cth  in this Court  I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court  Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s   at a later stage  It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ  The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed  notionally or actually  to the mast of the Boomerang I   Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded  it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth   In its report  Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction  Report No     Law Reform Commission  Australia  the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s   so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere  if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction  The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied  and hence that a just result would be obtained  It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made  and in achieving co operation between courts and arbitrators to this end  However  the Commission desired  in the solution it proposed  that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits  ALRC      That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that  as at   English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security  although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum  The Tuyuti   QB   at   Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz     SAf LR   at      Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa   Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson   Co A S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal     AC   at      There  Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract  which was still executory  involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations  including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches  arising under the executory  and now abandoned  contract  Lord Brandon of Oakbrook  who gave the leading speech  see     AC  C per Lord Diplock  said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact     AC at  F   He continued     AC at  A C       The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law   see Chitty on Contracts     rd ed    vol   p   para   and cases there cited  Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way  there are two ways in which A can put his case  The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party  as evinced to the other party and acted on by him  leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract  The second method is by showing that the conduct of B  as evinced towards A  has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract  even though it has not in fact been B s intention to do so  and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief  The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B  The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting  as against A  that he  B  has not abandoned the contract   Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd     KB           This contractual analysis is inapposite here  but their Lordships  approach shows that  notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit  the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties  obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed  In international trade and commerce  it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with  in particular  the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act    Cth   This is because in international trade and commerce  the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested  an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute  The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute  It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl  b  invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century  Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration  including Australia  are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce  However  the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl  b  rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties  chosen method or place of dispute resolution  Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and  indeed  local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains  see e g   Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M V Sky Reefer   US   at     Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler Plymouth Inc   US       Scherk v

 DLR   th     at      Federal Court of Appeal   But  just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl  b  so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election  When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized  it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings  It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way  but it did not do so  The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied  and to which Sheppard J referred  did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election  For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable  Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too  the arbitration agreement in cl  b  has been  in substance  abandoned or for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed    WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING      Pan argues that Art II r   of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  Pan says that where the contract was formed  as it argues the charter party was in this case  either by acts or conduct  Art II r   is not satisfied  Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence  In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS   Year Book Comm  Arb n XX   at    The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded  there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram  Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer   Year Book Comm  Arb n Vol II    at    The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required  A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party s appearance in the arbitration  In this matter  however  the critical telex of   April   commenced by being in form a confirmation  but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far  The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur  I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal  as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  And  In Zambia Steel   Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark   Eaton Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   Ralph Gibson LJ said       It is clear to me that the  New York  Convention by Art II par   did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document         The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg     WWR   at     that Art IV r  b  of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award  to provide  t he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof   They said that      there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process  in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an  agreement in writing   In A J  van den Berg s The New York Arbitration Convention of     at         the learned author notes that Art II r   excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded  at     that  as at   there had been only one      exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r   that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam  The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r   or the intent of its drafters  and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised  Significantly  he referred to the history of Art II r   which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate  In his article  Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice       International Arbitration vol   no   p   at   Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg s interpretation  Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter

following words       Confirmation in writing by one of the parties  which is kept  without contestation by the party    UN DOC E CONF   L       The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected  van den Berg  op cit at   Kaplan  op cit      Earlier  as Kaplan J  he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited     HKC    HCMP    that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law  see Schedule   to the International Arbitration Act    Cth   Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant  in writing  assented to the agreement to arbitrate  see at    It has been recognized that a national courts  in the interest of uniformity  should construe rules formulated by an international convention  especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods  in a normal manner  appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention  unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law  or by English or domestic legal precedent  but on broad principles of general acceptation  Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce s speech in

Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing   Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say   CLR at        It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application    see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh J      It is also important in construing international conventions  that the views taken by courts  particularly the Supreme Courts of nations  are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation  And  I am conscious that in s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  the definition of  arbitration agreement  is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r    As a matter of construction under Australian law  I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one  However  I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r   invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams  The pre contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed  It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter  And as Capt Piperakis said  he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided  The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel  on the evidence before me  unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound  That agreement  which thus brought cl  b  into existence as an agreement to arbitrate  was manifested by Comandate Marine s conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel  At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party  including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication  even though both parties have not executed it  The Epsilon Rosa     Lloyd s Rep   at     per Tuckey LJ  May and Brooke LJJ agreeing   But as Tuckey LJ pointed out     Lloyd s Rep at     one cannot generalize in these cases  The act of acceptance  which formed the contract  was the provision of the bank guarantee  And  it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine  Both parties were under a duty to co operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing   Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason J applying Butt v M Donald     QLJ   at     per Griffith CJ   No doubt cl  b  was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine  But that does not  of itself  comply with Art II r    Rather  the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence  So  the contract  being or including the arbitration agreement  was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails  The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r    And  because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of  letters or telegrams  including telexes or emails  then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r    A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer  Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited     NSWLR   at     per McHugh JA  Samuels JA agreeing at    Accordingly  I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed  FINAL RECAP  was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee  For the reasons I have given  based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r   that tacit acceptance is insufficient  on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no  agreement in writing  for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention    COMANDATE MARINE S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S   OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT    NSW      Comandate Marine argued  that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  were not found  I should grant a stay pursuant to s   of the Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW   The Commercial Arbitration Act    NSW  provides that an arbitration agreement      means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration   see s    By s   the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem  as I have found  without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings  I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration  However  its application for stay is made in Pan s proceedings  At the time when Pan s proceedings were commenced  Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now  I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant  By s     the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance  Although Comandate Marine s proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings  they form  as I have held  part of the same  matter  for the purposes of ss   and   of the Constitution   and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found    SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE     Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss  A     and  A of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and seeking relief under ss   and     including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were  colourable   It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court  Rather  it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  were  in essence  the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan  Comandate Marine  in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction  I do not think this argument has any substance  Part V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  in which s   is found  sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce  The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR   at     per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       In the latter case  the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    see   CLR at     in the following terms       Likewise  the operation of s   is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing off  If  as I consider  the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law  it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law  The statute provides an additional remedy     emphasis added      I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction  The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act    Cth  under the trade and commerce power in s  i  of the Constitution   There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court s jurisdiction  Pan s pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct  I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at        The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act    Cth  which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s    But  on examination  s   does not affect the jurisdiction which a court  including this Court  has from sources other than the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself  Rather  s   provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  or  iii  of the Constitution   In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise  s   thus provides some guidance  It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court  Section  iii   of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act    Cth  itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss   and     And s  ii  provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter  arising under any laws made by the Parliament   The purpose of s   is to limit  in the construction of the Act  the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction  Clearly enough  s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act    Cth   It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words  Owners of  Shin Kobe Maru  v Empire Shipping Co Inc   HCA         CLR   at   see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia   HCA   at       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Crennan JJ  Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked  the Court should exercise it   Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally   HCA         CLR   at       even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse  cf  Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority   HCA       per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  see too  Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA   at   per Allsop J  see too at      Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act    Cth  by s    But s   provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person  defined by s   as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person  who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property  The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it  Next  Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s   of the Admiralty Act    Cth  or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s   of that Act  Here  part of the  matter  within the meaning of ss  ii  and  iii  of the Constitution   is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which Pan has pleaded  The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such  matters   Here  the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently  one of the other  confers jurisdiction on this Court  Accordingly  I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this  That is not to say  however  that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available  necessarily  to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person  such as one under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss   or     I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act    Cth  cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction  Rather  appositely to the present proceedings  there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss   or   of the Act  Pan s claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The Court  at the final hearing  can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters  including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The Trade Practices Act    Cth  provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims  Indeed  one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract  not pursuant to contractual principles  but by force of an order under s   of the Act  Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at       And  the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  are designed to give effect  in cases of contravention of s     to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce  Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited   HCA         CLR   at       Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree   HCA         ALJR    International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels  is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution  s  i   And  par   of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia  see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at  A  D per Beaumont  Drummond and Sundberg JJ   Next  Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The  Kiukiang Career    Hi Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    In that case the relevant clause provided that  any dispute arising from this charter  would be settled in a London arbitration  Obviously  it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made  Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment  with whom Branson J expressly agreed  considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause  cl  b  viz   arising out of   Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement   FCR at  G   But  he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question   FCR at  A B  and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party   FCR at  B C   In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd     NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing  held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement  notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked  so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause  Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement  the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  does not bring a statutory claim within the expression  arising out of this contract   Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement  In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales  the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement  as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention   NSWLR at  F G   As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    with whom Toohey J agreed at p   in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes  arising out of  or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof   CLR at        the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between  the parties  or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause  Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS    at    In Union of India v EB Abby s Rederi AS  The Evje    AC   Lord Morris of Borth y Gest  reasoned that a dispute was one  arising out of  a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York Antwerp Rules   and to be settled in London  He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation   AC  H  B   G  Lord Reid at  E  and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at  C   Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect   AC at  F    In Ethiopian Oil Seed   Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc     Lloyd s Rep   at   Hirst J took the view that the words  arising out of  covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all  He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties  presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings  And  in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation   FCA         FCR   at           Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses  where the fair reading of them is not confined  was to give width  flexibility and amplitude to them  see   FCA       FCR   at        Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons  Rochdale  Ltd     FCR    There  French J said of a clause providing for disputes  arising under this agreement  that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement           can be said to arise out of the agreement  They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance  No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement     FCR at    In my opinion French J s reasoning  although directed to a different form of words  is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims     In the The  Playa Laga      Lloyd s Rep   at   Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words  all disputes arising out of this contract  are less precise than they looked  They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd     AC   at    The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution  first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause  Their Lordships  obiter  observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts  that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other  the dispute falls within the arbitration clause     Lloyd s Rep at    And  in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch   Lomb Inc     ATPR SS     at     Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract  He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source  And  conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established  if at all  irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties  Beaumont J said       In short  an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act   is not  as a matter of characterization  a  controversy or claim arising out of or relating to  the  Agreement  for the purposes of     that contract         I agree with Beaumont J s analysis  However  in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd   FCA   at   Allsop J suggested that the phrase  arising out of  in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical  rather than theoretical  meaning to be given to the word  contract  out of which disputes may arise  He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation  extent and scope  Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The  Kuikang Career      FCR    see   FCA      I am of opinion that the Full Court s construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event  like Allsop J  I am bound by it  Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   indicated that The  Kiukiang Career    FCR   was no longer good law and it should not be followed  I do not accept that argument  The construction of the operation of ss   and   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd   HCA         ALR   was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression  arising by reason of a contract   Thus Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were  for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  claims  arising by reason of a contract    ALR at      The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose  by reason of the contract  because if the thing complained of  namely the entry into the contract  had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Here  the claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  however  did not  arise out of the contract  because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim  Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence  although elements of the performance of the contract  or non performance of the contract will have become relevant  Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti anti suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  amounted  to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract   The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament  is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law  If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention    ESTOPPEL     Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r   of the New York Convention  I do not understand how that could be  The facts are objective  The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later  cf Masters v Cameron   HCA         CLR   at    No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind  There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter  I see no substance in the argument    ANTI ANTI SUIT INJUNCTION     Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate  I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court s jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country  I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment   Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship  Comandate    FCA    However  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s   of the International Arbitration Act    Cth  did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  claims  to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and or entry into of the charter and or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl  b  and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration  Comandate Marine  by its counsel  also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction  and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties  Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act    Cth   Comandate s undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators  There is no power in s   to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate  The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause   Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O Brien   HCA         CLR   at    While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum  they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party  Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings  if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London  it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on   June   the injunction must be continued    BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES     Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia  The Master and crew  when not at sea  might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere  The vessel s classification society representatives were in Greece  Singapore and Sri Lanka  The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December   and there were also the ship s agent and surveyor located there  The owners  and charterers  Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June    Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London  It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors  It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in   the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year  There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis  evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute  I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct  although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on   June    While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel s condition  it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned  Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing  The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship s company  Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least   different witnesses    from the Authority  who may be required to give evidence  Of course  certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore  on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship s company will be from Australia  There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl  b  that the seat of the arbitration be there    CONCLUSION     I order that Comandate Marine s motion be dismissed with costs  It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on   July   until further order will continue undisturbed    I certify that the preceding one hundred and twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice
