SZLZH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedFernando v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The learned Federal Magistrate  at paras   through to and including   of the reasons for judgment  canvasses the relevant statutory provisions as they impact on the circumstances of this case  The Magistrate noted correctly  with respect  that the effect of this Court s decision in the Fernando v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR   is that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to enlarge the time within which an application for review can be made   So much would seem inevitably to follow from the absence of any conferral of such power by the Migration Act     The Tribunal is a statutory tribunal and possesses no greater jurisdiction than that which Parliament has chosen to confer upon it  Section   of the Migration Act   lays down a period within which an application to the Tribunal can be brought  If an application is brought outside that period  then the Tribunal has no ability to extend time  whatever may be the merits either in law or in fact  of the challenge that is sought to be made to the decision of the Minister or his delegate   As was  with respect  correctly highlighted in the submissions made before me on behalf of the Minister  that does not mean that the decision of the Minister or his delegate is completely immune from challenge  The High Court has jurisdiction under s  v  of the Constitution to grant a constitutional writ in respect of any legal error made by the Minister or his delegate  What is undoubtedly lost  though  by a failure to institute a proceeding within the time prescribed by s   of the Migration Act     is an ability to have the decision of the Minister or his delegate  in respect of the protection visa application  reviewed on the factual merits
