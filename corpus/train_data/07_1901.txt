au cases cth HCA  html  In any event  if the Tribunal wrongly assumed that the letter did not contain Rashed Khan Menon s telephone number that was not a jurisdictional error but an error made within jurisdiction  An error of fact made by the Tribunal when exercising its jurisdiction is not a jurisdictional error  An error of that kind does not provide this Court with jurisdiction to quash the decision  Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR   at      In my opinion  the Tribunal was entitled in this review to take the view that it would not know to whom it was speaking if it were to make the telephone calls  In those circumstances  the Tribunal would have had difficulty attaching much weight to the evidence  even if that evidence was obtained  Moreover  it was never made clear to the Tribunal what evidence it was required to obtain  if possible  from the two witnesses   The appellant provided written submissions in support of the appeal and in both those submissions and orally before me  the appellant asserted that the Tribunal had erred under s  A due to the inclusion of incorrect factual material in the s  A letter it sent citedAppellant S  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     ALR   That said  however  the Tribunal must  when requested so to do by an applicant  give genuine consideration to the request  That requires

 if accepted  might have on the applicant s claims  Otherwise  the Tribunal would not be providing the applicant with a fair hearing which would demonstrate jurisdictional error  Minister for

knowing that  The Tribunal was entitled to reason  having regard to the appellant s own evidence and the evidence of his three witnesses  that any further evidence would be of no assistance and not be

for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     ALR   at     per Gleeson CJ and at     per Kirby J citedSZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It found that the information contained in the reference letters was exempt from s  A  of the Act and the information provided by the appellant  s  A b  of the Act  In any event  it was not information in the light of SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA     Two grounds of appeal are raised  First  it is said that the Federal Magistrate erred in failing to find that the Tribunal had committed jurisdictional error by the Tribunal failing to obtain evidence from two named persons  Secondly  it is said  the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error by not providing the applicant with particulars of the information the Tribunal considered was a reasonable part of the reason for affirming the delegate s decision  contrary to s  A of the Act  The notice of appeal does not particularise the information which the Tribunal failed to provide under that section   The Tribunal said in its decision    At the hearing the applicant provided the names of two of these letter writers  Showkat Hossain Hiron and Rashed Khan Menon  as witnesses who the Tribunal could contact  He provided telephone numbers  apparently in Bangladesh  for this purpose  In view of the strong concerns about the evidence provided by other witnesses at the hearing  noted below  and the obvious inability to positively identify those two persons simply by the telephone numbers provided  none of which appear on the letters written by them despite the fact that such letters are on the official party letterhead  I am not satisfied that the Tribunal should attempt to obtain further evidence directly from them followedSZDMC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  It is clear from the Tribunal s reasons that it had regard to the appellant s request or wishes to take evidence from the two witnesses  It gave reasons why it declined to do so  I agree  with respect  with Stone J who said in SZDMC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at       Section   makes it quite clear that the Tribunal is not obliged to grant a review applicant s request that a witness be called to give evidence even where the request is made in accordance with the statutory procedure  That being so  there was no breach of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule as set out in Div   of Pt   arising from the Tribunal s failure to make arrangements to hear  a witness  at some other time citedWADU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous
