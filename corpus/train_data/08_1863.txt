Kang v Commonwealth of Australia   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toKang v Attorney General s Department   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  Ms Kang considered that her employment had been terminated for reasons proscribed by the Workplace Relations Act    Cth   the Act    Specifically  she alleged that she had been dismissed because of a temporary absence from work due to illness and because she had filed complaints against her employer alleging breaches of applicable laws  She commenced a proceeding in the Federal Magistrates Court in which she sought re instatement to her former position  compensation and costs  At trial  she abandoned her claim for re instatement and advised the Court that she sought compensation and an apology  The proceeding was dismissed by the Federal Magistrate  see Kang v Attorney General s Department   FMCA     The respondent  who was  by order of this Court  identified as the Commonwealth of Australia  opposed the application and sought its costs  The Federal Magistrate did not rule on the costs application   Ms Kang lodged an appeal in this Court  The Commonwealth cross appealed on the costs issue  The Chief Justice directed  pursuant to s  A  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   the Federal Court Act   that the appeal be heard and determined by a single judge citedZhang v The Royal Australian Chemical Institute Inc   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The Federal Magistrate accepted that  once Ms Kang had made the allegation that Mr Kennedy had terminated her employment for one or more of the reasons identified in s  a  and  e  the onus fell on the Commonwealth  under s     to prove that the termination did not occur for a proscribed reason  see Zhang v The Royal Australian Chemical Institute Inc   FCAFC         FCR   at        The Federal Magistrate did not consider that Ms Kang had been dismissed because of absences due to illness  There was no reason why Mr Kennedy would have been aware of any of Ms Kang s absences because of illness  It had not been put to him that he was aware of any such absences or that he had acted because of them  His Honour rejected the claim  insofar as it was based on s  e  on the basis that it was well settled that the paragraph did not apply where all that the employee had done was to make a complaint directly to his or her employer  see Zhang at     Claveria v Pilkington Australia Ltd     IR   at      All of Ms Kang s complaints about her treatment were directed to other officers within the Attorney General s Department   In dealing with s   the Federal Magistrate directed himself consistently with the decision of a Full Court of this Court in Zhang at     and the decision of O Loughlin J in Robertson v South     IR   at      No error in his Honour s application of s   has been demonstrated   It is well established that s  e   is directed to the making of complaints to outside authorities  either by way of instituting proceedings against an employer  or by way of making allegations to officials who are empowered to investigate such allegations  The ground would not be established by the making of complaints directly to the employer alone  He v Lewin   FCAFC         FCR   at      per Gray and Mansfield JJ  Zhang at         referred toClaveria v

Zhang at         citedCouncil of Kangan Batman Institute of Technology and Further Education v Australian Industrial Relations Commission     ALR   Section   of the Workplace Relations Act    Cth  provides that a party must not be ordered to pay the costs of any other party in a proceeding alleging a contravention of s   of the Act unless the Court is satisfied that the applicant instituted the proceedings without  inter alia  reasonable cause  The respondent contended that the proceeding in the Federal Magistrates Court had been instituted without reasonable cause and that it had no real prospects of success or was doomed to failure  see Council of Kangan Batman Institute of Technology and Further Education v Australian Industrial Relations Commission     ALR   at    This was because Ms Kang did not produce any evidence capable of supporting her application and because the case she presented to the Court amounted to a mere allegation which could be rebutted by a simple denial by the respondent   Ms Kang s application to the Federal Magistrates Court  insofar as it alleged a contravention of s  e    was bound to fail  Her own evidence established that she had not made any complaint to any external authority  In the absence of such a complaint  for reasons already given  she could not succeed   It cannot  however  in my opinion  be said that her complaint alleging a contravention of s  a  had no prospects of success or was doomed to fail  Ms Kang gave undisputed evidence about a series of absences from work which commenced in mid February    She was absent when the decision was made to terminate her employment  She had provided the Attorney General s Department with medical certificates to explain her absences  This evidence alone was  of course  not sufficient to make good a claim of contravention of s  a   It was  however  sufficient  having regard to the provisions of s  b    to require more than a mere denial on the part of the respondent  The respondent did not  apparently  consider that a mere denial would suffice  It accepted that it was necessary to call Mr Kennedy to give evidence about when he made his decision  why he made it and his knowledge  or lack of it  of the medical certificates and Ms Kang s absences prior to his making the decision
