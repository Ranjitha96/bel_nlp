Claveria v Pilkington Australia Ltd   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedLaz v Downer Group Ltd     IR   By virtue of s   the respondent bears the onus of proving that it did not terminate the applicant s employment for a proscribed reason  or for reasons that included a proscribed reason  Section   reads as follows    In any proceeding under s   relating to a termination of employment in contravention of section   for a reason  a proscribed reason   set out in a paragraph of subsection   of that section           a  it is not necessary for the employee to prove that the termination was for a proscribed reason  but    b  it is a defence in the proceedings if the employer proves that the termination was for a reason or reasons that do not include a proscribed reason  other than a proscribed reason to which subsection   or   applies            Emphasis original   Section   is substantially identical to s  CQ of the Act as it stood prior to the Workplace Relations  Work Choices  Act    Cth   The authorities on s  CQ and predecessor provisions are therefore relevant  see  e g   Laz v Downer Group Ltd     IR     Laz   at   per Moore J   Counsel for Mr Claveria argued that Pilkington had terminated Mr Claveria s employment in contravention of s  e  of the Act  because Pilkington included in its reasons for termination the fact that    Mr Claveria had recourse to competent administrative authorities  and   that he had filed a complaint against his employer involving alleged violation of laws or regulations  Relying on s   Mr Claveria submitted that it was incumbent on Pilkington to establish  on the balance of probabilities  that his complaint to the union was not one of the reasons for Mr Dunstan s decision to terminate his employment   Whether there can be a satisfactory working relationship between Mr Claveria and the respondent s representatives in the event of reinstatement is a relevant consideration  Counsel for Mr Claveria referred me to various authorities concerning s  EE of Industrial Relations Act   as it then was  see Perkins v Grace Worldwide  Aust  Pty Ltd     IR     Perkins   Abbott Etherington v Houghton Motors Pty Ltd     IR   and Liddell v Lembke     ALR    This provision differed in terms from s    Some care must therefore be taken with these authorities  What they demonstrate  however  is that the Court has taken a reasonably robust attitude to an employer s claim of relationship breakdown with an employee following termination in contravention of a provision such as s  e  of the Act  compare Perkins at    Moore J adopted much the same approach in Laz   in determining to make an order under s  CR b  of the Act  which was in virtually identical terms to s    Although Mr Dunstan  Mr Findlay and Mr Claveria have been the subject of some strong criticisms in the course of this litigation  I doubt that this has created an insurmountable obstacle to Mr Claveria s reinstatement  The nature of Mr Claveria s work must be borne in mind  as well as the fact that he has worked for the respondent for many years  His long experience with Pilkington indicates that he has the capacity to take up employment with the company again  I accept that  if Mr Claveria returns to the Laverton factory  Mr Dunstan is likely to find the situation difficult initially  but I also accept that his embarrassment is likely to be short term  Furthermore  the nature and extent of the Pilkington s workforce should be borne in mind  There was evidence  which was undisputed  that Pilkington employs about   workers on afternoon shift at the Laverton factory and about   on the day shift  It also operates a large plant in nearby Geelong   In any event Mr Claveria s interests must be borne in mind  Mr Claveria impressed me as an employee who greatly desired to have back his job with Pilkington and would do all he could to retain it  He had worked for the respondent for some thirteen years before his termination in contravention of the Act  Since this happened  Mr Claveria has since struggled to find work  He worked a few shifts as a labourer store person with one employer and some other irregular shifts with another employer  He also found some other casual work  At the time of the hearing  Mr Claveria was employed on an irregular on call basis  An order for compensation would be an inadequate remedy in view of these employment difficulties  In these circumstances  Mr Claveria should not be left to compensation as a remedy for termination of his employment in breach of s  e  of the Act  compare Laz at     An order for Mr Claveria s reinstatement should be made  Mr Claveria argued that any order for reinstatement should be reinstatement  with continuity of service and in the same position and on the same terms and conditions of employment as he had immediately prior to his dismissal   He relied on Anthony Smith   Associates Pty Limited v Sinclair     IR    This was a decision concerning the former s  EE of the Industrial Relations Act     which was relevantly different in terms to s   compare Laz at   per Moore J concerning s  CR  of the Workplace Relations Act    which was in the same terms as s    The respondent argued that in truth Mr Claveria had confused the Commission s power under s   with the Court s power under s    It contended that the orders that Mr Claveria sought were beyond the power of the Court   Mr Claveria sought an order for compensation under s  c   In Laz at   Moore J thought it arguable that compensation and reinstatement could not be ordered in the same matter  Instead  his Honour considered that s  d  or s  d  and  e  would support an order for back pay  Indeed  in Laz at   Moore J thought that the power to order reinstatement may include the power to require the payment of lost wages or salary  There is  however  nothing in s   that in terms provides that an order for compensation under s  c  calculated by reference to the remuneration lost by an employee as a result of the wrongful termination cannot be made where an order for reinstatement under s  a  is appropriate  However characterized  Mr Claveria is entitled to an order for payment of wages lost as a result of his termination on   January   until the date of his reinstatement  The parties stated at the hearing that they would be in a position to make this calculation in the event the Court made an order of this kind   Mr Claveria also sought the imposition of a penalty under s  a  of the Act  In Laz at   Moore J held that the mere fact that there has been a termination in contravention of the Act does not  without more  give rise to a situation where a penalty should  as opposed to might  also be imposed  In Laz   Moore J referred to French J s comment in Fox v St Barbara Mines Ltd   FCA   that     penalties  are punitive in character and must be assessed having regard  inter alia  to the gravity of the conduct complained of  the existence of mitigating circumstances and the need to deter the repetition of the conduct whether by the employee in question or generally   In Fox   the employer terminated the employee s employment with a calculated and contemptuous disregard for the law and the Court imposed a penalty of    The employer s conduct in Laz was not of this kind and the Court did not impose a penalty  see generally Laz at   per Moore J   I consider a penalty should be imposed in this case  The respondent terminated Mr Claveria s employment with it on   January   for reasons that included retaliation for Mr Claveria s having recourse to the union in connection with perceived bullying and harassment on his manager s part  The evidence in this regard was clear  The respondent acted so as to deny Mr Claveria the freedom to pursue a basic right protected by the Act  Further  there has been less than straight dealing on the respondent s part  This was evident in Mr Findlay s seeking to stop Mr Dunstan from reiterating to Mr Seneviratne and Mr Vari on   February   that he had terminated Mr Claveria because he had gone behind his back to the union  Mr Findlay acknowledged in evidence that he knew that termination in retaliation for  going to the union  would be wrong and in breach of the Act  Mr Findlay and Mr Dunstan knew that Mr Claveria s going to the union had cost him his job on   January   and the reasons that Mr Dunstan advanced to justify Mr Claveria s termination that day did not represent the whole picture   The amount of penalty falls for consideration  The respondent submitted that  given the size of the company  there were  remarkably few  termination proceedings issued against it and that there was only a minimal need for specific deterrence  There was no evidence of these matters  however  and  if they are not common ground  then the respondent should have the opportunity to call evidence about its previous record  Indeed counsel for Mr Claveria accepted as much   If it be necessary  I would also grant leave to file and serve the amended statement of claim dated   September   and the Amended Defence also dated   September    Further  for the reasons set out above  I would dismiss the respondent s strike out motion  notice of which is dated   July     I propose to adjourn the matter to   November   to enable the parties to prepare short draft minutes of

Mr Claveria s argument was that  by seeking the assistance of the union on the morning of   January   he had recourse to  competent administrative authorities  within the meaning of s  e   He relied on Catusanu v Ray s Guard Security Services  unreported  MD Murphy JR  IR Court of Australia    July     Catusanu     His counsel argued that the expression  competent administrative authorities  was to be broadly construed and  having regard to the status and rights accorded trade unions under Australian law  the expression applied to the union to which Mr Claveria had recourse  Counsel added that s  e  was essentially a remedial provision designed to protect an employee against retaliatory termination where the employee took certain legitimate action against an employer in order to redress a relevant grievance  In view of its remedial character  the provision was to be liberally construed to constitute in substance  a catch all  to cover the range of avenues available at law for the redress of grievance  including resort to a trade union   Mr Claveria also argued that he filed a complaint within the meaning of s  e  when he made his complaint to Mr Skourdoumbis by telephone on the morning of   January    Alternatively  he argued that a complaint was filed when his complaint to Mr Skourdoumbis about the respondent s treatment was relayed by Mr Seneviratne to Mr Dunstan on the afternoon of that day  Mr Claveria contended that a complaint might be filed  although there was nothing in writing   Counsel for Mr Claveria argued that reinstatement was appropriate and that the respondent s challenge to his work performance was unsubstantiated  In relation to penalty  counsel submitted that the Court should have regard to the serious nature of the contravention  namely  there had been an infringement of a basic right or freedom  Counsel also submitted that there has been a degree of duplicity about Pilkington s reasons and the Court should have regard to this   Pilkington further submitted that the expression  competent administrative authority  did not cover the union or  indeed  any trade union  Counsel for Pilkington referred to the legislative history of s  e  the legislative context and dictionary definitions  He submitted that the decision in Catusanu was wrong  Counsel argued that the expression described an authority with the capacity and the right to determine a controversy  which is properly raised with it  In written submissions  counsel said    No attempt to aggregate different sources of authority into a composite  competent administrative authority  should be considered to create the authority required by section  e  of the  Act       Pilkington contended that    the union was not an administrative authority because it had nothing to administer  Rather  it was  a partisan player in the industrial field    the  administration  of the award is not the sole province of the union    s    serves the public policy aim of preventing retaliation  and   the powers of the union are not the powers of a  competent administrative authority   In the latter regard  Pilkington said    The flavour of the  e  section is that of dragging the employer to some third party capable of exercising coercive or investigatory powers  The union fundamentally lacks these      The powers of entry and inspection are not sufficient   Counsel for Pilkington argued that  in the circumstances of the particular case  Mr Claveria s allegation of bullying by  watching  him in the factory could not amount to a complaint of violating any law  in view of the type of work that Mr Claveria performed and his circumstances  including the warnings he had already received  Alternatively  he argued that there was no relevant relationship between the termination and the  filing of a complaint  or Mr Claveria s recourse to the union   Pilkington argued that  if a contravention of s  e  were found  compensation in lieu of reinstatement was the more appropriate remedy  If a penalty were to be imposed  then  so its counsel argued  it should be a modest one in view of Pilkington s good record   The specific question that arises here has apparently been considered on only one earlier occasion  by Murphy JR  in Catusanu   Murphy JR held that the expression  competent administrative authorities  in s  DF  e  embraced the union of which Mr Catusanu was a member  Mr Catusanu was employed by the respondent company as a security guard from May   until his employment was terminated on   November    Two days  earlier  on   November   his union had sent a letter of demand to the employer alleging underpayment of some of its members  including Mr Catusanu  and foreshadowing proceedings if the matter were not rectified  Murphy JR stated     T  he applicant s participation in the union s investigation of the alleged award breaches  and the service of a letter of demand on his behalf by the union  a registered organisation under the Act  is comprehended within the phrase  recourse to competent administrative authorities   Registered organisations are established under the Act  They have been accorded a particular status  and have privileges under the Act  They may be parties to an award  Their privileges include the right of appearance by their officers or employees  s   the right to sue for recovery of a penalty for a breach of an award  s   or to bring an application under Part VIA  s  EA   Registered organisations thus have a clearly recognised and important role within the framework of the Act and for that purpose can be easily accommodated within the term  competent administrative authorities       The recourse by the applicant to the union  in circumstances  where  the union lodges a letter of demand on his behalf alleging a breach of an award  is recourse to a  competent administrative authorit y  within the meaning of s  DF e   I am not satisfied that the respondent has excluded this recourse as a reason for its termination of the applicant s employment  The respondent has breached s  DF e    As previously noted  s  DF e  was renumbered as s  CK e  by the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act    Cth  and renumbered again as s  e  by the Workplace Relations  Work Choices  Act    Cth    The terms of the provision have not changed  There was no formal letter of demand in the present case  However  Mr Claveria s communication to Mr Skourdoumbis about his treatment at Pilkington s factory and his request for assistance  which was taken up by the union and led to Mr Seneviratne requesting Mr Dunstan for a meeting to discuss Mr Claveria s bullying and harassment allegation would constitute  recourse to a competent administrative authority  providing the union is to be regarded as such an authority   The respondent argued that not only was the decision in Catusanu wrong and that I should reject the reasoning in it  but also that under the Act as it now stood the standing of trade unions was significantly diminished  Accordingly  the reasoning in Catusanu had even less force than before  For the following reasons  I reject this submission   Although not constituted by statute  trade unions continue to have a particular and distinct status as registered organizations under the Act  This status indicates that  for some purposes at least  they are capable of constituting  competent administrative authorities  although whether a union has such status in any particular case will depend on the nature of the allegation an employee makes against his or her employer  the relief sought  and whether the union is legally capable of managing  dealing with  or addressing the grievance appropriately   The distinctive status of trade unions appears from the Act  The union in this case is an organisation of employees registered or taken to be registered under the Registration and Accountability of Organisations Schedule  Schedule   to the Act   There are various types of workplace agreements to which such a union may be party  Thus  an employer may make an agreement with a trade union in the circumstances referred to in s   of the Act  or a union greenfields agreement in the circumstances set out in s    Unions may be involved in multiple business agreements  see s    Unions continue to be parties to awards  compare ss          They continue to enjoy various rights to make applications to the Commission on behalf of employees  see  e g   s    They also enjoy the right of appearance by their officers or employees  ss     the right to sue for recovery of a penalty for a breach of an award and other industrial instruments and for certain remedies  s   or to bring an application under s   in respect of termination of employment  s   and to apply for an order under s   in respect of contraventions of ss   and    As perusal of the Act readily shows  this list is not in any way exhaustive   Having regard to the breadth and importance of the rights of unions under the Act  some more of which are referred to below  it does not seem to me that a union is appropriately characterised as merely  a partisan player in the industrial field  as the respondent would have it  Whilst individuals may have some of the same rights as a union  they do not have the same aggregate of rights  Nor do they have them for precisely the same reasons as trade unions  Moreover  even if a union were appropriately characterised as  the advocate and advisor  of the employee  the union would not thereby cease to be a body  outside  the employer  Further  whilst the current Act may impose greater restrictions than previously on unions and their powers  for example  regarding a union representative s right of entry to investigate a suspected breach  discussed below  the character of trade unions and their powers remain largely the same   Plainly enough  a trade union will not be a  competent administrative authority  for every grievance  Whether or not it has this status will depend on the nature of the grievance and the union s legal capacity to manage  deal with  or otherwise appropriately address it  As it happened  the union in this case had power by virtue of statute and the certified agreement to investigate and manage the allegation of workplace bullying and harassment  which Mr Skourdoumbis reasonably believed Mr Claveria had communicated to him on the morning of   January     By virtue of the Pilkington  Australia  Limited Automotive Division  Laverton Operations Agreement    the certified agreement  which was made pursuant to the former s  LJ and certified by the Commission pursuant to the former s  LT  the union could manage Mr Claveria s grievance  The certified agreement applied to Mr Claveria s employment   The objectives of the certified agreement relevantly included the provision of  a healthy  safe and non discriminatory working environment whilst ensuring compliance by the parties with all applicable occupational health and safety  equal opportunity and WorkCover legal requirements   clause  v   The certified agreement entitled the union to participate in a process to resolve grievances raised by Pilkington s employees  Amongst other things  the parties agreed  in clause  ii  that        subject to the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act   as amended  all grievances  claims or disputes whether relevant to this Agreement or any other matter  shall be dealt with in the following manner so as to ensure the orderly settlement of the matters in question         a  Any grievance or dispute that arises shall  where possible  be settled by discussion on the job between the employee and direct supervisor  e g  Shift Co ordinator or Site Leader      b  If the matter is not resolved at this level  the matter will be further discussed between the employee concerned  the shop steward  the supervisor and the appropriate manager     c  If no agreement is reached  the relevant Union official and shop steward will discuss the matter with the manager and the Company s nominated industrial relations representative     d  Subject to the rights of the parties  should the matter still not be resolved  it shall be referred by either party to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission or to a third party mutually agreed       That is  under the certified agreement  the union was entitled to require that Mr Claveria s grievance be dealt with by discussion between union representatives and Pilkington and  if this failed  the union was entitled to refer the matter to the Commission  Pursuant to s   of the Act  the union was entitled to institute proceedings in a court for a penalty in relation to a breach of a term of the agreement  Further  as appears below  certain union representatives had rights of entry to the workplace in respect of suspected breaches of the agreement  see   and   citedAndersen v Umbakumba Community Council     IR

practice may be relevant  see Vienna Convention  art  b   The Vienna Convention  in art   permits recourse to the preparatory work of the Termination of Employment Convention and the circumstances of its conclusion   The preamble to the Termination of Employment Convention indicates that the Convention was designed to state international standards with regard to the termination of employment at the initiative of the employer  The Convention is obviously aimed at providing protection for workers against unjustified termination  see also Mohazab at   per Lee  Moore and Marshall JJ   The Termination of Employment Convention sets out general principles in terms that allow ratifying countries a deal of flexibility in their manner of observation  Thus  art   which falls into Pt I headed  Methods of Implementation  Scope and Definitions  contemplates that States will differ in the manner in which effect is given the Convention  taking account of national differences  The basic principle affirmed in art   of the Convention is that an employee s employment is not to be terminated without a valid reason  being a reason relating to the employee s capacity or conduct or based on the operational requirements of the employer s undertaking  Article   with which this case is principally concerned  lists reasons that do not constitute valid reasons  Article   states reasons that  shall not constitute valid reasons for termination  include union membership or participation in union activities  acting as a workers  representative  race  colour  sex  marital status  family responsibilities  pregnancy  religion  political opinion  national extraction or social origin  and maternity leave  I have already referred to art  c  which is reproduced in s  e  of the Act  I interpolate that the balance of art   is expressed in s  b   d   f  and  h  although not always in terms identical with art    For example  s  f  is wider than the equivalent art  d  presumably to give effect also to other international instruments such as the Convention concerning Discrimination in Respect of Employment and Occupation    C   done at Geneva on   June   entered into force on   June   and the Termination of Employment Recommendation   see s    Article   provides that temporary absence from work because of illness or injury is not a valid reason for termination of employment  see s  a    Article   within Div B of Pt II  concerns procedure prior to or at the time of termination  Article   and   within Div C of Pt II  deal with appeal procedure  Other articles within Pt II relate to the period of notice  art   and severance allowance and income protection  art    Part III of the Convention is devoted to  Supplementary Provisions concerning Termination of Employment for Economic  Technological  Structural or Similar Reasons    The Termination of Employment Convention uses the expression  competent administrative authorities  only once in art  c   Elsewhere the Convention refers to  competent authority  see  e g  arts     and      measures may be taken by the competent authority or through the appropriate machinery  art      competent authority  as opposed to  a court  labour tribunal  arbitration committee or arbitrator  in art     and  bodies  in arts     and     and arts     and      notification to the  competent authority   It may be inferred from this usage that the expression  competent authority  embraces any body that has the relevant capacity under national law to act in the way that the relevant article contemplates  as for example  to take the measures contemplated in arts     and     or to receive the notifications referred to in arts     and      It may also be inferred that the expression  competent authority  is wider than the words  a court  labour tribunal  arbitration committee or arbitrator   The expression  competent administrative authorities  on the other hand  apparently contemplates competent authorities of a particular kind  That is  the expression contemplates competent authorities of an administrative kind  as opposed to competent authorities of another variety  such as competent legislative authorities or competent judicial authorities    The preparatory work is of some limited assistance  The Termination of Employment Convention has its immediate origins in the ILO Termination of Employment Recommendation      R   done at Geneva on   June    This instrument laid down basic standards regarding  amongst other things  the need for a valid reason for employment termination  point    It also contained the predecessor provision to art  c   It provided  at point  c   the filing in good faith of a complaint or the participation in a proceeding against an employer involving alleged violation of laws or regulations   should not constitute  a valid reason for termination  As can be seen  this early provision differed from the current art  c  in two respects  first  it contained a  good faith  requirement  and  secondly  it did not contain the expression  recourse to competent administrative authorities  citedAB v Registrar of Births  Deaths and Marriages   FCAFC  http www austlii

permits recourse to the preparatory work of the Termination of Employment Convention and the circumstances of its conclusion   Two further considerations fortify my conclusion that the union was in this case a competent administrative authority  The first is that s  e  is plainly a remedial provision protective of an employee s fundamental rights  Its interpretation is therefore governed by well accepted principle  Though dissenting  Black CJ reaffirmed this principle in AB v Registrar at   when he observed      One consequence of the principle that a statute should be interpreted in a way that promotes its objects  whether those are expressly stated or not  is that beneficial or remedial legislation should generally be given a liberal or generous construction in preference to a technical one   Section  e  contemplates that  in any particular situation  there may be a variety of competent administrative authorities to which an employee may have recourse  It is therefore immaterial that Mr Claveria may have turned to another body  which also had the legal capacity to deal with his grievance  It is enough that he turned to the union  which had relevant legal capacity to manage his complaint  It would defeat the purpose of this remedial provision if it were to be construed with too zealous a technical eye  To adopt an overly narrow interpretation of the expression  competent administrative authorities  is to narrow the practical protection that this provision is designed to afford   This leads me to a second consideration that fortifies my conclusion with respect to the union  The history of trade unions in Australia is very different to the history of trade unions elsewhere  save perhaps for New Zealand   It is well recognized that this is in large part because of Australia s conciliation and arbitration system  which developed around the beginning of the twentieth century  For a discussion of this phenomenon  see Peter Fairbrother and Charlotte

Termination of Employment Convention and the circumstances of its conclusion citedZhang v The Royal Australian Chemical Institute Inc   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The Report makes two things clear  although they are probably apparent from the terms of the Termination of Employment Convention and its history  First  the specific object of art  c  is to protect an employee from termination in retaliation for his or her recourse to an appropriate body in relation to some alleged misconduct on the employer s part  see also Zhang v The Royal Australian Chemical Institute Inc   FCAFC         FCR     Zhang   at    Secondly  the expression  competent administrative authorities  has no technical meaning or fixed application  It may signify no more than an  appropriate body   other than a legislative or judicial body or the employer  in the ratifying State to receive the communication of an allegation of misconduct on the employer s part  A body will be appropriate in this context if it has the legal capacity to manage or suitably address the allegation in some way  whether by investigation  a dispute resolution process  or otherwise    To approach the expression in this way is in keeping with its ordinary meaning  I refer in this connection to English language dictionaries  such as the Oxford English Dictionary or The Macquarie Dictionary  The expression  competent administrative authorities  is plainly a compound one  Bearing in mind the terms  history and object of the Convention  as well as the specific object of art  c  it apparently signifies bodies  other than the employer  within the ratifying State having the legal capacity to manage  deal with  or suitably address the allegation in some way  other than by judicial decision or legislative action   In this context  an allegation of misconduct on the employer s part might be managed or suitably addressed in a variety of ways  including by investigation  reporting  prosecution  engagement of a dispute resolution process  making a determination or recommendation  or providing information and advice  I reject the respondent s submission that the expression  competent administrative authorities  refers only to  an authority with the capacity and the right to determine a controversy which is properly raised with it   This is to adopt an unjustifiably narrow approach  which is at odds with the history of art  c  and the aim of the Termination of Employment Convention and art  c   The purpose of art  c  is best served if a liberal interpretation of the expression  competent administrative authorities  is adopted  because it extends to an employee the protection against illegitimate retaliatory termination that art  c  was designed to give   As previously noted  I infer from the statutory objects provisions  s   and the legislative history of s  e  and s   that the meaning of the expression  competent administrative authorities  in s  e  bears the same meaning as in art  c  of the Termination of Employment Convention  from which the expression derives  In particular  I reject the respondent s submission that the expression in s  e  should be given a more restrictive meaning than in the Convention because of ss   and    I can discern no warrant for so doing discussedHe v Lewin   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  To date  s  e  has received limited judicial attention and the expression   competent administrative authority  even less  In He v Lewin   FCAFC         FCR     He   at   a Full Court held that s  CK e   a predecessor of s  e  was  directed to the making of complaints to outside authorities  either by way of instituting proceedings against the employer  or by way of making allegations to officials who are empowered to investigate such allegations   emphasis added   Thus  the ground could not be established by the making of complaints directly to an employer  Zhang followed He on this point  see Zhang at   per Lander J  with whom Spender and Kenny JJ agreed referred toLeicester v Western Desert Puntukurnuparna Aboriginal Corporation  unreported  IRCA     February   As already stated  absent authority on the point  the natural meaning of the expression  competent administrative authority  is a body with legal capacity to manage  deal with  or suitably address an employee s allegation against his or her employer  in some way  In Leicester v Western Desert Puntukurnuparna Aboriginal Corporation  unreported  IRCA     February   Ritter JR reached much the same conclusion  see also Weier v Modern Alarms   AIRC   at   per Senior Deputy President Richards  Thus  the Occupational Health and Safety Officer at the Victorian Trades Hall

IR   at   per Marshall J   The question arises as to what orders should be made  Mr Claveria seeks an order for reinstatement pursuant to s  b  which the respondent opposes  The respondent argued that compensation in lieu of reinstatement was the more appropriate remedy  The respondent submitted that the Court should be satisfied that Mr Claveria  may not have worked for long  even if he had not been terminated on   January   because of       a  the nature of his work  being in automotive glass    b  the reducing number of contracts       c  the complaints about performance raised against the Applicant  and   d  the assertion that these had been raised for a lengthy period   There was little evidence led at the hearing in support of the first two factors  There was some evidence that some redundancies were foreshadowed and that Mr Claveria was likely to be amongst them  It was  however  by no means clear from the evidence that redundancies were in any sense inevitable in the near future  At most the evidence showed that it was possible that  if reinstated  Mr Claveria might be made redundant at some time in the near or distant future  If this were to happen  he would be subject to the terms on which redundancies were made  This is not a significant factor against reinstatement   The principal factors relied on in opposition to reinstatement were Mr Claveria s work performance and his relationship with Mr Dunstan  Mr Claveria had been given a final warning by Mr Dunstan s predecessor in July    There was  however  evidence that  when Mr Dunstan began  he had no difficulty with Mr Claveria and that Mr Dunstan told him  in August    we re going to make this a clean slate   Further  there was no reliable evidence that Mr Claveria s work performance was poor  Mr Dunstan conceded that there was no reliable evidence about the quality and quantity of his output  and that he had never observed Mr Claveria s work citedJennings v Salvation Army     IR   In conformity with this too  it has been held that an application for compensation under the no fault compensation scheme established by the Accident Compensation Act    Vic  does not fall within s  e  rather it is merely a claim for compensation  see Jennings v Salvation Army     IR   at     per Marshall J approved in Zhang at   see also Zhang v The Royal Australian Chemical Institute Inc   FCA

application for compensation under the no fault compensation scheme established by the Accident Compensation Act    Vic  does not fall within s  e  rather it is merely a claim for compensation  see Jennings v Salvation Army     IR   at     per Marshall J approved in Zhang at   see also Zhang v The Royal Australian Chemical Institute Inc   FCA   at   per Finkelstein J   In Zhang the Full Court indicated that  whilst the filing of a complaint and participation in proceedings must involve alleged violation of laws or regulations by the employer  recourse to competent administrative authorities need not  see Zhang at   contra Zhang v The Royal Australian Chemical Institute Inc   FCA   at   per Finkelstein J  This conclusion is consistent with the structure of s  e   and art  c  of the Termination of Employment Convention  as well as the history of the formulation of art  c  see   above  If  however  recourse to competent administrative authorities must also involve alleged violation of laws or regulations  then this element is also satisfied  This is because Mr Claveria alleged  in substance  that Mr Dunstan was bullying and harassing him  This conduct involved an allegation of violation of s   of the OHS Act citedPerkins v Grace Worldwide  Aust  Pty Ltd     IR   Whether there can be a satisfactory working relationship between Mr Claveria and the respondent s representatives in the event of reinstatement is a relevant consideration  Counsel for Mr Claveria referred me to various authorities concerning s  EE of Industrial Relations Act   as it then was  see Perkins v Grace Worldwide  Aust  Pty Ltd     IR     Perkins   Abbott Etherington v Houghton Motors Pty Ltd     IR   and Liddell v Lembke     ALR    This provision differed in terms from s    Some care must therefore be taken with these authorities  What they demonstrate  however  is that the Court has taken a reasonably robust attitude to an employer s claim of relationship breakdown with an employee following termination in contravention of a provision such as s  e  of the Act  compare Perkins at    Moore J adopted much the same approach in Laz   in determining to make an order under s  CR b  of the Act  which was in virtually identical terms to s    Although Mr Dunstan  Mr Findlay and Mr Claveria have been the subject of some strong criticisms in the course of this litigation  I doubt that this has created an insurmountable obstacle to Mr Claveria s reinstatement  The nature of Mr Claveria s work must be borne in mind  as well as the fact that he has worked for the respondent for many years  His long experience with Pilkington indicates that he has the capacity to take up employment with the company again  I accept that  if Mr Claveria returns to the Laverton factory  Mr Dunstan is likely to find the situation difficult initially  but I also accept that his embarrassment is likely to be short term  Furthermore  the nature and extent of the Pilkington s workforce

citedAnthony Smith   Associates Pty Limited v Sinclair     IR   An order for Mr Claveria s reinstatement should be made  Mr Claveria argued that any order for reinstatement should be reinstatement  with continuity of service and in the same position and on the same terms and conditions of employment as he had immediately prior to his dismissal   He relied on Anthony Smith   Associates Pty Limited v Sinclair     IR    This was a decision concerning the former s  EE of the Industrial Relations Act     which was relevantly different in terms to s   compare Laz at   per Moore J concerning s  CR  of the Workplace Relations Act    which was in the same terms as s    The respondent argued that in truth Mr Claveria had confused the Commission s power under s   with the Court s power under s    It contended that the orders that Mr Claveria sought were beyond the power of the Court referred toTreadwell v ACCO Australia Pty Ltd  unreported  Federal Court of Australia  VG     December   BC  In Treadwell v ACCO Australia Pty Ltd  unreported  Federal Court of Australia  VG     December   BC  Parkinson JR made orders under s  CR b  similar in terms to those Mr Claveria seeks  If there is power to make orders of this kind  it derives from s  d  and  e   Whilst s  b  permits the Court to make an order requiring the employer to reinstate the employee  s  d  permits the Court to make any other order it thinks necessary to remedy the effect of such a termination and s  e  permits the Court to make any other consequential orders  These latter powers are broad  Section  d  alone  alternatively s  d  and  e  together  would support an order that the position to which Mr Claveria is reinstated be the same position on the same terms and conditions as he held prior to termination on   January   or to another position on terms no less favourable  and that his employment be treated as having been continuous between the date of termination and the date of reinstatement
