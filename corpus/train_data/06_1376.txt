Paliflex Pty Ltd   NSWSC         NSWLR   at   Austin J identified three matters relevant to whether leave should be granted under s  S  They are as follows           i  a preliminary consideration of the defendant s basis for disputing the debt which was the subject of the demand     ii  an examination of the reason why the issue of indebtedness was not raised in an application to set aside the demand  and the reasonableness of the party s conduct at that time  and    iii  an investigation of whether the dispute about the debt is material to proving that the company is solvent  referred toCommonwealth Bank of Australia v Begonia Pty Ltd     ACLC  There are three aspects to this topic  The first aspect is the evidence that relates to Helimount s profit and loss and trading performance  The second aspect is the quality of the evidence put forward by Helimount and  in particular  whether it was the  fullest and best  evidence  Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Begonia     ACLC   at   per Hayne J  The third aspect is the evidence as to the assets and liabilities of Helimount and this is relevant for the purposes of considering its ability to borrow funds to overcome any temporary cashflow or liquidity problems  I start with Helimount s profit and loss and trading performance  The liquidator has deposed to Helimount s profit and loss and trading performance over certain years  His evidence is to the effect that in   Helimount earned   from the sale of wine grapes and made a profit of    In   the company earned   from the sale of wine grapes and   as a profit on the sale of property and made a profit of    In   Helimount made sales of   and made a profit of    In   Helimount could not sell its wine grapes  The liquidator states that no financial statements have been prepared for the last year  which I assume to be the financial year ended   June    The liquidator does not reveal the source of these figures  In ACE Contractors   Staff Pty Ltd v Westgarth

means available to the applicant to vindicate its rights   Elite Motor Campers Australia v Leisureport Pty Ltd  supra   referred toExpile Pty Ltd v Jabb s Excavations Pty Ltd     ACSR  The above principles were recognised as the relevant principles by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Expile Pty Ltd v Jabb s Excavations Pty Ltd     ACSR   per Santow JA  with whom Meagher and Handley JJA agreed  at      It is to be presumed until the contrary is proved that Helimount is not able to pay all its debts as and when they become due and payable  Helimount submits that it has discharged the onus of proving that it is solvent  It submits that it has at most only a couple of creditors and a substantial excess of assets over liabilities  It points to three matters in particular  First  it submits that three of the valuations of the land it has produced are more reliable than the liquidator s estimates and should be preferred to the liquidator s estimates  It seems to me that the answer to this submission is that it is a matter of small consequence because even if it is correct it increases the upper limit of the liquidator s estimates by no more than    Secondly  Helimount submits the debt owed by it to Mr Callipari  which on Helimount s case is now in the order of   is not presently due and owing  The answer to this submission is that even if it is correct  on the liquidator s figures there is still an excess of liabilities over assets  In saying this I am assuming as liabilities the full debt to the ANZ and the principal amount of the debt claimed by Web Wealth  Thirdly  Helimount refers to the values placed on properties owned by Helimount in a letter from NFFA Finance Warehouse Pty Ltd to it dated   August    It is said that the letter embodies an offer of finance to Helimount  I do not place any weight on the values referred to in the letter first  because I do not know who is putting forward the values and secondly  because the letter specifically states that  the properties are being revalued and values may change   Furthermore  I note that the figures put forward in the letter suggest that in some cases there have been very significant increases in what Helimount said were the value of various properties in early   referred toHVAC Construction  Qld  Pty Ltd v Energy Equipment Engineering Pty Ltd     ACSR  In this case Mr Callipari has caused the company to make an application for review under s  A  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   For the purposes of the application of s  A  I do not think that any distinction should be drawn between an application for review and an appeal although in the case of an application for review what French J called the  constitutional imperative  in HVAC Construction  Qld  Pty Ltd v Energy Equipment Engineering Pty Ltd     ACSR   may be relevant to whether approval to cause a company to bring an application for review should be granted  That consideration would not be relevant in the case of an appeal  In HVAC Construction  Qld  Pty Ltd v Energy Equipment Engineering Pty Ltd  supra  at     French J was inclined to agree with that approach saying that s  S should be given a strict construction in order that the purpose of the legislative scheme could best be served referred toLane Cove Council v Geebung Polo Club Pty Ltd  No     NSWSC         FLR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  htmlAn application for approval can be made before a proceeding is commenced or sought nunc pro tunc after the proceeding has been commenced but before the substantive proceeding  be it an application for review or an appeal  is heard  A key consideration when an application is made at either of these stages is the preservation of the company s assets and the importance of avoiding a situation whereby the company s assets are diminished by an unsuccessful appeal   Lane Cove Council v Geebung Polo Club Pty Ltd  No     NSWSC         FLR    Therefore  in deciding whether to grant approval a court will consider the solvency of the company and whether the director offers to undertake to pay the costs if the appeal is unsuccessful  see Lightburn Pty Ltd v Kama Power Products Pty Ltd  supra  at     referred toLightburn Pty Ltd v Kama Power Products Pty Ltd     LSJS  Mr Callipari caused Helimount to bring the application for review  At the time the application was made Helimount was subject to a winding up order and  by reason of s  A  of the Corporations Act   Mr Callipari did not have the power to cause the company to bring the application  For the reasons I gave in Lightburn Pty Ltd v Kama Power Products Pty Ltd     LSJS   at   there is no longer a residual power at common law in directors to cause a company to appeal against a winding up order  In my opinion  the same applies in the case of an application for review under s  A  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   However  the Court is able to grant approval under s  A A  of the Corporations Act nunc pro tunc for Mr Callipari to cause the company to bring the application  The first question before me is whether approval under s  A A  should be granted  As I have said  Helimount did not make an application to set aside the statutory demand under s  G of the Corporations Act   However  it disputes the debt  or at least the quantum of the debt  it is said to owe to Web Wealth  By reason of s  S of the Corporations Act Helimount may not  without the leave of the Court  oppose the application for it to be wound up in insolvency on a ground that it could have relied on but did not so rely on for the purposes of an application by it for the statutory demand to be set aside  The second question before me is whether Helimount should be granted leave under s  S  By reason of Helimount s failure to comply with the statutory demand it is presumed to be insolvent  s  C  of the Corporations Act   It seeks to establish that it is not insolvent and whether it has discharged the onus of proving that it is not insolvent is the third question before me  An application for approval can be made before a proceeding is commenced or sought nunc pro tunc after the proceeding has been commenced but before the substantive proceeding  be it an application for review or an appeal  is heard  A key consideration when an application is made at either of these stages is the preservation of the company s assets and the importance of avoiding a situation whereby the company s assets are diminished by an unsuccessful appeal   Lane Cove Council v Geebung Polo Club Pty Ltd  No     NSWSC         FLR    Therefore  in deciding whether to grant approval a court will consider the solvency of the company and whether the director offers to undertake to pay the costs if the appeal is unsuccessful  see Lightburn Pty Ltd v Kama Power Products Pty Ltd  supra  at     referred toShakespeares Pie Co Australia Pty Ltd v Multipye Pty Ltd   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  htmlApplying these principles to the facts  I do not think that leave under s  S should be granted  I have divided the grounds upon which the debt might be disputed into those which relate to the principal amount and those which relate to interest  Leave should not be granted in relation to the grounds which bear on the principal amount because even on a preliminary consideration there is no genuine dispute in relation to the principal amount and  furthermore  Helimount s explanation for not applying to set aside the statutory demand is unsatisfactory  Leave should not be granted in relation to the grounds which bear upon the interest because the explanation for not applying to set aside the statutory demand is unsatisfactory and  more importantly  it is not clear to me  and in terms of s  S  I am not satisfied  see Shakespeares Pie Co Australia Pty Ltd v Multipye Pty Ltd   NSWSC   per Barrett J at   that grounds bearing upon the interest are material in proving Helimount is solvent  In other words  it is not clear to me that Helimount is not saying that it is solvent irrespective of Web Wealth s claim for interest  I decline to grant leave under s  S  Section  A of the Corporations Act provides           A  A person is solvent if  and only if  the person is able to pay all the person s debts  as and when they become due and payable           A  A person who is not solvent is insolvent  referred toSwitz Pty Ltd v Glowbind Pty Ltd   NSWCA         NSWLR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  htmlThe matter referred to in  iii  is an express limit on the power to grant leave  s  S  and its scope and operation have been considered in later cases  The issue which has arisen is whether s  S  means that the debt must on the company s case make the difference between a finding of solvency and a finding of insolvency  or is it sufficient that depending on what other findings are made it may be relevant to the question of solvency  The New South Wales Court of Appeal in Switz Pty Ltd v Glowbind Pty Ltd   NSWCA         NSWLR   favoured the former interpretation  Spigelman CJ  with whom Handley and Giles JJA agreed  said  at            By the time an application under s  s is made  the company will be presumed to be insolvent and will have the burden of proving that it is not  In my opinion s  s  directs attention  in part  to what it is that the company intends to prove and how it intends to prove it  If the company is not prepared to contemplate the possibility that its assertion of solvency is subject to qualification  then the Court cannot be  satisfied  of the mandatory precondition in s  s   An objective element is introduced by the word  material  but that can only be determined after identifying the company s contentions      If  as here  the company intends to prove that it is solvent whether or not a debt is payable  then with respect to a ground based on dispute about the debt  the test of materiality to it  proving  its solvency  cannot be satisfied
