Limited   AC   The AAT continued as follows       Apart from his lumbar spondylosis the deceased suffered from other non war caused illnesses including osteoarthritis of the sacroiliac joints and osteoarthritis of the knee joints  It seems to us that those conditions would also have played their part in the deceased s inability to exit the tractor         Ten weeks prior to the accident the deceased had obtained a prescription for an anti depressant and an analgesic  Again nothing is known as to the frequency with which the deceased availed himself of this mediation and if he had taken any on the day of his death  If he had taken an anti depressant this may have affected his reaction time         We agree with the Applicant that the material before us has raised an hypothesis  however the real question is whether given all the material before us  the hypothesis can be said to be a reasonable one         Although facts may be assumed for the purpose of constructing an hypothesis  a distinction must be made between assumed facts on the one hand and speculation and conjecture on the other         The fact situation and statement of law by Wright LJ in Caswell v Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Limited   AC   at   is particularly apposite in this matter  namely          My Lords  the precise manner in which the accident occurred cannot be ascertained as the unfortunate young man was alone when he was killed  The Court therefore is left to inference or circumstantial evidence  Inference must be carefully distinguished from conjecture or speculation  There can be no inference unless there are objective facts from which to infer the other facts which it is sought to establish  In come cases the other facts can be inferred with as much practical certainty as if they had been actually observed  In other cases the inference does not go beyond reasonable probability  But if there are no positive proved facts from which the inference can be made  the method of inference fails and what is left is mere speculation or conjecture            As we have previously pointed out  facts may be assumed for the purpose of constructing an hypothesis  However in this case  all that is known is that the deceased suffered from war caused lumbar spondylosis amongst other diseases which would have limited mobility  and had obtained a prescription for anti depressant medication  He was killed when a tractor he was driving rolled over  To then say that it was his lumbar spondylosis that prevented him jumping clear of the tractor so as to avoid fatal injury when all he had was one to two seconds in which to take that action is  on what is known in this matter  mere speculation and incapable of raising an hypothesis properly categorised as reasonable    Accordingly  the AAT affirmed the decision under review   In his written submissions  Mr Vincent  who appeared for the applicant  accepted that a finding as to whether a reasonable hypothesis has or has not been raised is a question of fact  However  he argued that the authorities establish that the AAT  when considering whether a reasonable hypothesis has been raised  is not entitled to find facts  prefer certain material  resolve conflicts or reject matters   I should mention one other matter  The applicant sought to derive comfort from the AAT s reference in its reasons to the distinction between assumed facts and conjecture  According to Mr Vincent  the AAT s citation of Caswell v Powell Duffryn showed that the AAT was purporting to make a finding of fact on the balance of probabilities   I read the AAT s reference as intended merely to indicate that something more than conjecture or speculation is required before a hypothesis can be characterised as reasonable  I do not read the AAT s citation of Caswell v Powell Duffryn as indicating that it was making impermissible findings of fact  whether on the balance of probabilities or otherwise  The AAT was only saying what the authorities have said  the material before the AAT must point to the connecting hypothesis  rather than the connection remaining purely in the realm of conjecture or speculation   The applicant has failed to establish that the AAT erred in law  The application must be dismissed  with costs   I certify that the preceding forty   numbered paragraphs are a true copy
