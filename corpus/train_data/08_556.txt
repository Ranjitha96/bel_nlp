au cases cth FMCA  html  This is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court   SZHZZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FMCA   dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the second respondent  the Refugee Review Tribunal  the Tribunal  not to grant the appellant a protection visa pursuant to s   of the Migration Act    Cth   the Act    The appellant  a citizen of the Philippines  arrived in Australia on   April   and lodged an application for a protection visa on   May   of that year  He claimed to have a well founded fear of persecution in the Philippines by reason of his being a homosexual Muslim male in the Philippines  His application was refused by the Minister on   August    The Tribunal affirmed that decision on   December     The appellant outlined the basis for his claim to protection in writing on three occasions prior to the hearing before the Tribunal  His fundamental claim was that as a male Muslim homosexual he would be in an impossible position if he returned to the Philippines  His case was summed up in these words    Muslim and gay  Two words that can not or must not or shall not or will not go together  Gay is a taboo in muslim society   He claimed to maintain his Muslim faith  He came from a large and powerful Muslim family from Mindanao and was a member of a particular tribe that adhered to the Muslim faith  His family was active in politics and he described his father as having been a warlord  He was the only homosexual in his family and was ostracised by his siblings for this reason  The situation was aggravated by the existence of Muslim radicals and terrorists  in particular the Moro Islamic Liberation Front  MILF   He claimed to suffer emotional and mental anguish  He claimed that his family would not protect him from harm and that  the law of my country do not shield me in such familial and religious pressure   He referred to threats he had received after he refused to join the MILF  He feared connivance between his family and the MILF  He referred to an occasion in   when three Muslim men with faces covered by handkerchiefs cut his long hair with scissors and threatened that next time they would cut his belly   His evidence to the Tribunal fleshed out his position  He said that in the   incident the men said that if he kept on  doing this  they would cut his belly he took them to mean being a homosexual  He did not report the incident to the police because they would  laugh  because I m gay   The Tribunal recorded the following  He also stated that  as well as the local Muslim language  he spoke the non Muslim languages of Tagalog and Bisayan  so people could not tell he was Muslim  His homosexual friends were all Christians  He did not reveal to people that he was from the  named  family or was Muslim  so that they would not tell his family anything about him citedAppellant S  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The appellant apparently did not refer to any particular difficulties in living in Manila  However  the Tribunal does not report asking him about that topic or about the practicality of relocation or his fear of persecution if relocated  As far as the reasons for decision go  the Tribunal had no information from the appellant on those points  It is to be noted that the appellant said that he  in effect  disguised that he was Muslim  cf Appellant S  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         CLR    It does not follow that there would not be persecution of Muslim male homosexuals in Manila simply because it is not predominantly a Muslim city  Again  it may well be that a properly directed Tribunal will find that relocation is an answer to the claim  I am not satisfied that such a finding is inevitable   The appeal will be allowed  the orders of the Federal Magistrates Court will be set aside  and  in lieu thereof  it will be ordered that the decision of the Tribunal be set aside and the matter remitted to the Tribunal for further decision according to law  The respondent Minister will pay the costs  if any  of the appellant of this appeal and of the Federal Magistrates Court proceeding   I certify that the preceding twenty one   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the

Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR         ALJR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It is submitted for the respondent Minister that the findings by the Tribunal are inconsistent with the appellant fearing persecution as required by s  R of the Act  It is submitted that neither serious harm nor systematic and discriminatory persecution was or could be established  referring to VBAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR         ALJR     It is not clear that this point was raised before the Federal Magistrates Court  and is not raised by notice of contention  In any event  the point is not decisive  In my opinion  if the appellant s case is taken at its highest  s  R could possibly be met  He paints a serious picture as to the plight of a Muslim homosexual male suffering from crushing oppression  including psychological harm  physical harm and the threat of physical harm  with no effective State protection  I am not satisfied the Tribunal squarely dealt with that case  As I have said  the manner in which it dealt with particular incidents may have been coloured by the failure to focus upon the essence of the appellant s claim  Whilst the appellant may well have difficulty in persuading a properly directed Tribunal that the requirements of s  R are met  I cannot rule out that possibility   It is also submitted by the Minister that the Federal Magistrate was correct in holding that the relocation finding by the Tribunal was decisive  The difficulty with that argument is that the Tribunal did not concentrate upon the position of a Muslim male homosexual from his family and his tribe in Manila or elsewhere other than Mindanao  He said in one of his communications to the Tribunal  I cannot think of any place that is safe
