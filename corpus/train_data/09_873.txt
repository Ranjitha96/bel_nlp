Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu make discovery of all documents in its possession relating to the financial affairs of the second applicant for the years ending   December     and     Forbes Engineering

Engineering  Asia  Pte Limited v Forbes  No     FCA   I made the following substantive orders  In relation to the amended application filed   March  In relation to the notice of motion filed   September   At the time of delivery of judgment I also made orders for the applicants and the respondents to file and serve submissions as to costs  Those submissions were filed and served  and I take them into account for the purposes of delivery of this judgment  In the substantive judgment I found the applicant successful in part  In favour of the applicants I found  in summary  that However

NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  htmlWhile I note the applicants  submission concerning the decision in Leading Edge Events Australia Pty Ltd v Kiri Te Kanawa  No     NSWSC    a case where the trial judge ordered a defendant to pay   of the plaintiff s costs notwithstanding the defendant s submission that the plaintiff only recovered   of its total claim against the defendant  a review of that decision reveals that the costs awarded included significant items of expenditure clearly related to the circumstances of that particular case including promotional material  travel  wages  copyrighting and bookkeeping  Finally  although the respondents were successful pursuant to their notice of motion filed   September   in obtaining an order excluding certain affidavit evidence  they were unsuccessful in relation to their claim for a permanent stay  which was an important issue requiring determination in respect of that notice of motion citedNew South Wales Dairy Corporation v Murray Goulburn Co Operative Company Limited     IPR  While I found the second respondent not liable to the applicants in respect of their claims  all aspects of the defence of the second respondent appeared to be jointly conducted with common defences of both respondents  The first respondent was clearly an active protagonist  No evidence was given by nor sought from the second respondent in the proceedings  The second respondent appeared to take no active part in the proceedings  In my view there should be no order in respect of costs for or against the second respondent  New South Wales

relation to the position of the applicants and the first respondent  although I identified a number of issues for decision  in the final analysis the key issues for decision were whether the respondents were liable in respect of the   and   profit shortfalls  The applicants were successful in their claim against the first respondent with respect to the   profit shortfall  the respondents in defending the applicants  claim for the   profit shortfall  Second  the respondents were unsuccessful in respect of a majority of the defences raised in the substantive proceedings  A significant amount of time and evidence were taken up during the trial in relation to those unsuccessful defences
