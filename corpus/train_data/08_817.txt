Sydney Ferries Corporation v Australian Maritime Officers Union  Corrigendum   June     FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedCSR Ltd v Cigna Insurance Australia Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The concession made by Mr Goot appears to me to be correct  In CSR Ltd v Cigna Insurance Australia Ltd   HCA         CLR     the joint judgment of six members of the High Court noted  at   that the power to stay proceedings on the ground of forum non conveniens is an aspect of the inherent or implied power which  in the absence of some statutory provisions to the same effect  every court must have to prevent its own processes being used to bring about injustice  The joint judgment went on to say  at   that     t he counterpart of a court s power to prevent its processes being abused is its power to protect the integrity of those processes once set in motion  And in some cases  it is that counterpart power of protection that authorises the grant of anti suit injunctions    Emphasis in original  citation omitted   After giving examples of circumstances in which it may be appropriate to grant an anti suit injunction in relation to foreign proceedings  the joint judgment observed  at   that     t he inherent power to grant anti suit injunctions is not confined to the examples just given  As with other aspects of that power  it is not to be restricted to defined and closed categories  Rather  it is to be exercised when the administration of justice so demands or  in the context of anti suit injunctions  when necessary for the protection of the court s own proceedings or processes    Citation omitted   The joint judgment identified a number of circumstances in which it may be appropriate to make orders restraining the commencement or continuation of proceedings in other courts  or arbitral bodies   These include the following        where the other proceedings interfere with or have a tendency to interfere with proceedings pending in the court   CSR  at   National Mutual Holdings Pty Ltd v The Century Corporation     FCR     at     per Gummow J    where the institution or continuation of the other proceedings involves unconscionable conduct or the unconscionable exercise of legal rights   CSR  at       where the other proceedings are  according to the principles of equity  vexatious or oppressive   CSR  at   for example where a second proceeding is commenced in a court  and an action is pending in another court with respect to the matters in issue   Henry v Henry     CLR     at     per Dawson  Gaudron  McHugh and Gummow JJ  and    where the bringing of proceedings with respect to one claim is properly to be seen as an election either not to proceed on another claim or not to proceed in another jurisdiction  thus giving rise to an estoppel by conduct   CSR  at       The joint judgment emphasised  however  that the power is not to be confined by reference to the example found in the decided cases  Rather  it is a power the limits of which are to be determined by the dictates of   equity and good conscience     CSR  at   referred toHenry v Henry     CLR   The joint

toTransport Workers  Union of New South Wales v Australian Industrial Relations Commission   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  By instituting proceedings in the AIRC the day after withdrawing its interlocutory application  Sydney Ferries seeks to achieve  in substance  the same result in the AIRC that it failed to achieve in this Court  It is true  as Mr Goot points out  that there are differences between s   and   of the Workplace Relations Act and that the differences are not confined to the nature of the decision making body that exercises the relevant powers   One example is that an order under s   of the Workplace Relations Act can be made only by the persons identified in s     while an order made under s   must be complied with by any person to whom the order is expressed to apply  including a union registered solely under State law  s     Transport Workers  Union of New South Wales v Australian Industrial Relations Commission   FCAFC     at     per Gray and North JJ   Nonetheless  in order to discharge its functions  the AIRC must address and make a determination on the proper construction of the statutory expression   industrial action   and its application to the circumstances of the present case  That is precisely one of the points that was argued before this Court on the application for injunctive relief that was withdrawn by Sydney Ferries referred toMiller v University of New South Wales     IR   I accept that  as Mr Goot contended  a determination by the AIRC on the question of statutory construction cannot bind this Court  Any such determination appears to be merely a step to the determination of future rights by the AIRC and does not bind the parties  Miller v University of New South Wales     IR   at   per Gray J  at   per Ryan and Gyles JJ  Nonetheless  having pursued a particular course in this Court and failed  Sydney Ferries now seeks relief in the AIRC that is in substance very similar if not identical to that sought in this Court on an interlocutory basis  It does so  moreover  on the basis of arguments that it has decided not to pursue in this Court on an interlocutory basis and which may remain to be resolved  In my opinion  to allow Sydney Ferries to proceed in this way would impair the integrity of the processes of this Court that Sydney Ferries itself chose to invoke  To put the matter another way  Sydney Ferries  initiation of proceedings in the AIRC is an attempt to seek relief of the kind that it has unsuccessfully sought in this Court  and requires the AIRC to address issues of construction that were and may still be before this Court   It is difficult to see  so far as the present dispute between the parties is concerned  what point would be served by the proceedings in this Court seeking declaratory relief in relation to the construction of the Enterprise Agreements if Sydney Ferries were to succeed in its application before the AIRC  whether on an interim or permanent basis  Assuming Sydney Ferries succeeded before the AIRC  it would have obtained orders binding on the Respondents and their members  in the sense that any contravention of the orders could lead to the imposition of penalties  For the AIRC to make such orders  it would have to address the questions of construction presented by the application to this Court  This is so because if Sydney Ferries  actions are not authorised by the Enterprise Agreements  it is unlikely that the Respondents could be said to be organising or threatening   industrial action    Moreover  if the AIRC made the orders sought by Sydney Ferries  the onus would be on the Respondents to challenge the orders  whether by way of an appeal to a Full Bench of the AIRC  for which leave is necessary  or  more likely  by an application in this Court or the High Court by way of constitutional writs alleging jurisdictional error  There would be no need for Sydney Ferries to obtain any additional relief from this Court for the threatened or actual   industrial action   to be effectively restrained   I should add that the effect of the anti suit injunction sought by the Respondents will not be to deprive Sydney Ferries of recourse to the AIRC  The order proposed by the Respondents will apply only until the determination of the application for declaratory relief in this Court  Once that occurs  as Mr Birch SC  who appeared with Mr Gibian for the AMOU  accepted  it will be open to Sydney Ferries to seek orders under s   of the Workplace Relations Act from the AIRC  Any declaration made by the Court as to the effect of the Enterprise Agreements will be binding on the parties by virtue of s   of the Workplace Relations Act   Since an expedited hearing has been granted  there will be only a short delay before Sydney Ferries  application to this Court is resolved  Thereafter it will be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to it in the AIRC
