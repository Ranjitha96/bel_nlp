a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court given on   May   Bodenstein v Minister for Immigration   FMCA    That Court rejected the appellants  application for orders setting aside a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal  the Tribunal  handed down on   August    The Tribunal had affirmed a prior decision by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  the Minister  not to grant the present appellants  application for visas  In my opinion  the appeal should be dismissed with costs  Facts The appellants  whom without any disrespect I shall refer to as the Bodensteins  are Israeli nationals and are a family  Mr Bodenstein arrived in Australia on   September    On the same day he lodged an application for a  Temporary Business Entry  Class UC  visa  That class of visa permits a non citizen with skills needed by Australian businesses to enter and work temporarily in Australia  The letters  UC  are not an acronym and have no special meaning other than as a class designator  The class UC visa may be granted for a period of up to three months  in which case it is called a Subclass    Business  Short Stay  visa  Alternatively  it may be granted to permit a stay of more than three months but less than four years  in which case it is called a Subclass    Business  Long Stay  visa  Mr Bodenstein  and his family as dependents  applied for the Subclass    Business  Long Stay  visa  The power of the Minister to grant a visa is conferred by s   of the Migration Act    Cth   the Act   It provides      After considering a valid application for a visa  the Minister   a  if satisfied that   i  the health criteria for it  if any  have been satisfied  and   ii  the other criteria for it prescribed by this Act or the regulations have been satisfied  and   iii  the grant of the visa is not prevented by section    circumstances when granted   A  refusal or cancellation of temporary safe haven visas     special power to refuse or cancel  or any other provision of this Act or of any other law of the Commonwealth  and   iv  any amount of visa application charge payable in relation to the application has been paid   is to grant the visa  or   b  if not so satisfied  is to refuse to grant the visa consideredDietrich v The Queen     CLR  First  the requirements of procedural fairness  or  as it was formerly known  natural justice  required the Bodensteins to be given an opportunity to put their case to the federal magistrate  That opportunity was afforded to them  Although it has been held that in certain circumstances a serious criminal proceeding may be stayed if an accused person is not afforded legal representation  it is apparent that that power is a manifestation of the Court s power to stay an unfair criminal trial  Dietrich v The Queen     CLR   at   per Mason CJ and McHugh J      per Toohey J    per Gaudron J  However  Dietrich is not concerned with civil proceedings  More importantly  it has been held that the rules of procedural fairness in civil proceedings do not extend to requiring the provision of legal representation  New South Wales v Canellis   HCA         CLR   at     per Mason CJ  Dawson  Toohey and McHugh JJ  cf Rivera v United States of America   FCAFC   at       per Heerey  Sundberg and Crennan JJ referred toHouse v The King   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlSecondly  even if that were not so  Mr Bodenstein has shown no error in the way the federal magistrate dealt with the application for referral  Although I express no concluded view on the matter  it is likely that an attack on the exercise of the power in r     would need to comply with the principles enunciated in House v The King   HCA         CLR    In particular it would be necessary to show that the federal magistrate approached the exercise of the power on an erroneous basis or took into account some extraneous consideration or failed to take into account some essential matter  This ground must be rejected  Mr Bodenstein s second complaint about the Federal Magistrates Court was that it had exceeded its jurisdiction  In essence his point was that by permitting the Tribunal s decision not to grant the visas to stand  the federal magistrate was effectively pre emptorily terminating the Supreme Court proceedings because without Mr Bodenstein here to prosecute them they would inevitably be dismissed  I would accept that  generally speaking  the Federal Magistrates Court has no power to dismiss Supreme Court proceedings  However  that is not what the federal magistrate did  Both before and after his decision those proceedings remained on foot  A variant of this argument was that the federal magistrate s decision undermined the exercise by the Supreme Court of its jurisdiction  There may well be some circumstances where the removal of a litigant from the jurisdiction might be a contempt of the court seized with the litigation  However  the removal of an alien by force of federal law could never be a contempt of purely state court proceedings  This ground too must therefore be rejected  The grounds relating to the TribunalcitedNew South Wales v Canellis   HCA         CLR  http www
