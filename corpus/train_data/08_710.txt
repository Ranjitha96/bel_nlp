was said by Williams J in dissent in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v United Aircraft Corporation   HCA         CLR   at     Spirits submitted that FKP s motion for leave to amend its FACC by filing a pleading in the form of the draft SFACC should be refused for the following three reasons   a  FKP s proposed amendment is so obviously futile that it would be struck out had it appeared in the original pleading  there were at least two elements to this an alleged mistaken reliance on s   of the Act and the absence of any pleading that  by making the trade mark applications  Spirits has invaded any presently existing legal or equitable right of FKP  or has breached any alleged obligation owed to FKP  such as would be necessary to attract any principle in the terms stated in Lenah Game Meats    b  to allow the amendment would lead to substantial prejudice being suffered by Spirits which could not be cured by an order for costs  because registration of the trade mark applications would be held up indefinitely  pending the outcome of this  already lengthy and complicated  proceeding  and   c  there are powerful considerations militating against an exercise of the Court s discretion in favour of allowing the amendment   Each of these reasons was elaborated on in Spirits  written and oral submissions  but it is the reliance on s   of the Act in the pleadings which are at the forefront of Spirits  argument which is put in the following way   Paragraphs     of the draft SFACC  which lead up to para   plead that   a  the Stolichnaya trade mark applications are substantially identical with or deceptively similar to each of the Stolichnaya Label Mark  the Stolichnaya Word Mark  the Stoli Word Mark  the Ohranj Label Mark  the Ohranj Word Mark and the Blue Salyt Mark  the Stolichnaya currently disputed marks   para   of the draft SFACC   b  the Stolichnaya trade mark applications are in relation to similar goods to the Stolichnaya currently disputed marks  para   of the draft SFACC  and   c  each of the Stolichnaya trade mark applications has a priority date which is not earlier than the priority date for the Stolichnaya currently disputed marks

cth FCA  html  It is common ground that the requirements for the Court to grant leave to amend are accurately set out in a passage from SPI Spirits  Cyprus  Ltd v Diageo Australia Ltd  No      FCA   at     in relation to an application by Spirits to amend        The starting point is that all of such amendments should be made as are necessary to enable the real questions in controversy between the parties to be decided  Queensland v J L Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR     Dresna Pty Ltd v Misu Nominees Pty Ltd   FCA    Although O   r   of the Federal Court Rules  the Rules  confers a discretion on the Court as to whether to allow the amendments  it is well established that an amendment will ordinarily be allowed provided it can be done without harm to the other party which cannot be compensated by an award of costs or an adjournment  The Commonwealth v Verwayen   HCA         CLR     Londish v Gulf Pacific Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR          The overriding concerns should be to ensure that all matters in issue upon which the parties seek adjudication are determined in the proceeding and to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings  Caruso Australia Pty Ltd v Portec Australia Pty Ltd   FCA          Order   rule   of the Rules makes explicit reference to this principle             All necessary amendments shall be made for the purpose of determining the real questions raised by or otherwise depending on the proceeding  or of correcting any defect or error in any proceeding  or of avoiding multiplicity of proceedings               The general approach is that where a party satisfies the Court that he or she generally desires to amend the pleadings so as to alter an existing claim or to introduce a new claim  leave should be granted unless the proposed amendment is so obviously futile that it would be struck out if it had appeared in the original pleading or would cause substantial injustice which cannot be compensated for in the manner indicated in   above  Abela v Giew     WN  Pt    NSW    at              It is recognised that the allowance of an amendment before a trial begins  when there is time for a proper defence to be filed  stands in a very different position from amendment towards the end of a trial  Ketteman v Hansel Properties Ltd   AC   at   per Lord Griffiths   FKP s constructive trust claim is pleaded in the following terms   First  the trade mark applications are derivative of the currently disputed marks in that they incorporate the words STOLICHNAYA  STOLI or MOSKOVSKAYA  and are sought to be registered in respect of  similar goods  within the meaning of s   of the Act  as the goods in respect of which those trade marks are registered
