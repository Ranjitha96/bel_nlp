Roche Products Pty Limited v National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAssociated Provincial Picture Houses Limited v Wednesbury Corporation   EWCA Civ         KB   Roche submitted that the October   February   and June   decisions were so unreasonable that no reasonable person could have exercised the power in the way the Committee did   Associated Provincial Picture Houses Limited v Wednesbury Corporation   EWCA Civ         KB    It also submitted that the decisions lacked a  legally defensible foundation  in their factual material and in logic   Luu v Renevier     ALR   were capricious and irrational   Tickner v Bropho     FCR   at     or were so at variance with the material before the Committee as to be unreasonable   Fuduche v Minister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethnic Affairs     FCR     The Committee accepted that its decisions are open to review under s  B of the Judiciary Act on the ground of unreasonableness notwithstanding that the Court does not have jurisdiction to review those decisions under the ADJR Act    Roche placed particular weight on the following statement in the record of reason concerning the Committee s February   decision    Orlistat is currently only indicated for use in a relatively small group of patients with serious and significant weight problems  those with a Body Mass Index  BMI  greater than   with other serious diseases  or those with a BMI greater than   not for the general population who might wish to manage more minor weight issues   For the reasons given above for rejecting the complaint of Wednesbury unreasonableness  I reject both of these contentions   Roche submitted that each of the February and June   decisions involved the exercise of a personal power at the behest of another person or the exercise of a discretionary power in accordance with a rule or policy without regard to the merits of the particular case  It placed reliance on the extract from the transcript of the February   meeting of the Committee set out in   above  The significance of the statements made by Committee members as recorded in that extract from the transcript of the meeting is explained by documents produced by two Committee members in response to subpoenas served on them   Shortly before the February   meeting of the Committee  Mr James Galloway  the jurisdictional member of the Committee who represented Tasmania  advised Mr Roscoe Taylor  the Tasmanian Director of Public Health  that the Schedule   and Appendix H listing of orlistat was to be reconsidered at the Committee s February   meeting and asked   Do you wish to direct me on voting on this matter  Mr Taylor responded   Unless you have any arguments to the contrary  I would like Tasmania to strongly support rescheduling Orlistat to S   referred toKioa v West   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The extent to which the rules of natural justice apply to decisions of the Committee under s  D  is controlled by the relevant provisions of the Act and Regulations   Kioa v West   HCA         CLR   per Mason J at   Wilson J at   Brennan J at   and Deane J at     As outlined above  see     the Regulations require advance public notice to be given of a meeting of the Committee at which a decision is to be made concerning the scheduling of a substance  They do not require advance notice to be given of a decision to foreshadow consideration of the scheduling of a substance  The Regulations establish a regime for the receipt and consultation of public submissions both before and following a scheduling decision  A sponsor who seeks a scheduling decision concerning a substance will  it may be assumed  make a submission in support of the scheduling decision sought by it  Certainly Roche did in respect of the scheduling of orlistat  A scheduling decision does not come into effect until after the Committee has had the opportunity to consider the further submissions  if any  made in response to its decision by those who made submissions concerning the scheduling decision  A record of the Committee s reasons for the decision are to be publicly accessible   In my view the statutory provisions which govern the exercise of the Committee s power under s  D  of the Act do not disclose an intention that the exercise of that power is conditioned on sponsors of substances being given rights to be heard additional to the rights to make the submissions for which the Regulations provide referred toMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The record of reasons of the Committee are  not to be scrutinised upon over zealous judicial review by seeking to discern whether some inadequacy may be gleaned from the way in which the reasons are expressed    Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR   per Brennan CJ  Toohey  McHugh and Gummow JJ at    In particular  in the circumstances of this case  the different contexts in which the Committee evaluated the prevalence of obesity and other significant weight problems are important   In February   the Committee agreed to include orlistat in Appendix H on the grounds of potential public health benefit  It was then concerned to identify the total number of adults in Australia for whom orlistat might be indicated  By contrast  in February   the Committee was concerned to review the current scheduling and Appendix H listing of orlistat in the context of criticism of its earlier decision  That criticism was based in large part upon the advertising of Xenical during the television program Australian Idol   The reference in the Committee s record of reasons of February   to the  relatively small group of patients with serious and significant weight problems  is  in my view  to be understood as a reference to the relatively small proportion of the viewers of Australian Idol who were likely to have serious and significant weight problems  That is  it is to be understood as a reflection on the audience to which the Committee understood the advertisements to be directed  The Committee  it may be assumed  would have adopted a different approach had Roche directed the advertisement to an audience comprised mainly or significantly of overweight adults by  for example  placing the advertisements in a magazine directed to adults with weights problems   For the above reasons  I do not accept that the reference in the Committee s record of reasons of February   to a  relatively small group of patients with serious and significant weight problems  is suggestive of unreasonableness affecting the decision of the Committee referred toMinister for Industry and Commerce v Tooheys Ltd     ALR   As the Full Court observed in RG Capital Radio Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Authority   FCA         FCR    R G Capital    at   at   there is no simple rule for determining whether a decision is of an administrative or legislative character  At   at   the Court cited the following passage from the judgment of the Full Court in Minister for Industry and Commerce v Tooheys Ltd     ALR   at     The distinction is essentially between the creation or formulation of new rules of law having general application and the application of those general rules to particular cases  Commonwealth v Grunseit     HCA       CLR     Hamblin v Duffy No     ALR   and de Smith s Judicial Review of Administrative Action  th ed  p    In Commonwealth v Grunseit   Latham CJ expressed     the distinction in these terms   The general distinction between legislation and the execution of legislation is that legislation determines the content of a law as a rule of conduct or a declaration as to power  right or duty  whereas executive authority applies the law in particular cases  notfollowedPro Health Products Pty Limited v McEwen   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In arguing that decisions of the Committee under s  D  are administrative in character  Roche placed reliance on Pro Health Products Pty Limited v McEwen   FCA    In that case Emmett J described a scheduling decision of the Committee as  clearly an administrative one   However  it appears that the true character of a scheduling decision of the Committee was not the subject of argument in that case which  moreover  was decided under significant time constraints  I do not regard his Honour s description as reflecting a considered view on the question   Roche additionally drew attention to what it described as the tightly drawn nature of the matters which s  E  requires or allows the Committee to take into account when exercising its power under s  D  of the Act  I give consideration below to the nature of these matters  I do not accept that they are as tightly drawn as Roche contends  In particular  I regard it as significant that s  E i  requires the Committee to take into account  any other matter that the Committee considers necessary to protect public health    Considerations necessary to protect public health  as the paragraph recognises  includes risks  whether imminent or long term  of death  illness or injury from the use of the substance in question but may extend beyond these considerations  Taken together  the matters identified in s  E  call for the evaluation of broad policy considerations touching upon an important area of public administration referred toProject Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Additionally  it seems to me that the legitimacy of the Committee s apparent practice of not recording the number of votes cast for and against resolutions moved at its meetings is open to serious doubt  However  it was not contended in this case that the Act or Regulations disclose an intention that deficiencies in a record of proceeding of the Committee affect the validity of any conduct or decision of the Committee to which the record relates  see Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         ALR     The parties agreed that the best evidence available concerning the reasons for the June   decision of the Committee to confirm the decision to remove orlistat from Appendix H is found in the draft minutes of that meeting  No ratified minutes of the meeting had come into existence at the time of hearing  The draft minutes record that the reasons of the Committee include        that direct to consumer advertising had the potential to lead to inappropriate extent and patterns of use of orlistat outside its registered indications                that direct to consumer advertising may adversely affect the ability of pharmacists to provide advice about other appropriate weight management strategies                that there were concerns about the ability of direct to consumer advertising to accurately present information about the potential toxicity  safety  risks and benefits of orlistat and the specific indications for use                that while acknowledging the need to address the problems of obesity in the Australian community  pharmacotherapy was not the first line of treatment for weight management and direct to consumer advertising had the potential to over emphasise its role over those of lifestyle change                that the safeguards that allowed inclusion in Schedule   such as education programmes for pharmacists and consumer information  did not remove the potential for direct to consumer advertising to adversely affect appropriate provision of orlistat                that the changes to the wording of the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code  TGAC  aimed at strengthening the requirements of advertising weight loss products had not sufficiently prevented messages promoting inappropriate use of orlistat and the Committee did not feel that the current TGAC was able to prevent advertising from over emphasising the role of pharmacotherapy                on balance  the NDPSC believed that direct to consumer advertising worsened the risk benefit balance of access to orlistat and the committee felt it necessary to protect public health by preventing direct to consumer advertising   The draft minutes summarise the Committee s June   decision in the following way    In summary  after considering all post meeting submissions  the  Committee  decided to confirm its February   decision to revoke the Appendix H listing as  under section  E of the Act and according to the NCCTG Guidelines  it is not appropriate for orlistat to be advertised direct to consumers appliedRG Capital Radio
