Humphries v Newport Quays Stage  A Pty Ltd   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toFox v Olsen   SASC  http www austlii edu au au cases sa SASC  htmlThere is likely to be a saving of time if the proceedings are tried together  but it is difficult to quantify the extent of the saving  It would be nowhere near the substantial saving referred to in Fox v Olsen   SASC   at   per Mullighan J  with whom Doyle CJ and Wicks J agreed   It seems to me that   weeks is a reasonable estimate for the trial of the proceeding brought by Mr Humphries  It is difficult to be precise about an estimate of trial time if all proceedings are tried at the same time  but  doing the best I can  I proceed on the basis of an estimate of     weeks  If tried separately  the proceedings involving Mr Humphries would  as I have said  take   weeks and the other   proceedings would take     weeks each  There is a real prospect that the parties in those   proceedings would not contest a number of findings of fact made in the first proceeding and therefore  if they did proceed  the estimate for each proceeding would be closer to   week than to   weeks  Trial management issues are likely to loom large if all proceedings are tried together  It would be necessary to put in place detailed and possibly complex procedural orders to ensure the trial proceeded in an orderly fashion  There is considerable potential for time consuming arguments about the cross admissibility of evidence  Counsel would need to be alert to the evidence rulings about cross admissibility  These problems are by no means insurmountable  but they are a reason not to order that the proceedings be tried together  The proceeding involving Mr Humphries is further advanced  in terms of preparation for trial  than any of the other proceedings
