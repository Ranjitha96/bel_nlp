and Maria Luisa   FCAFC       FCR    The purpose of the Parliament conferring rights to proceed in rem against a ship or other property was to make that res   first  available as property of a wrongdoer or debtor to satisfy a maritime claim and  secondly  because it had been arrested  to cause its owner to appear and subject himself to in personam liability  Therefore  it is critical to construe the expression  the owner  in s  b  so as to ensure the effective exercise of the jurisdiction that the section confers  Because  the owner  is not defined for the purpose of s  b  the expression identifies someone who holds a sufficient proprietary interest in the res itself  directly or indirectly  that he could sell or dispose of the res or  cause such a sale or disposition  so as to convey a good title to the purchaser  The common law and equity have developed differing indicia and categories of ownership of which legal title and beneficial interest are notable examples  But  in the world of maritime adventures  ownership of a ship is not always easy to ascertain and often will be deliberately obscured  That is why the expression  the owner  in s  b  should be given a broad interpretation so as to enable achievement of its purpose of connecting the person who is liable for a maritime claim to a ship or other property that he owns  And he will own the res   if he can sell or cause its sale because of his title to that property  In a valuable discussion  Reyes J  with whom Ma CJHC and Stone J agreed in separate judgments  considered the  perhaps narrower  expression  beneficial owner  as used in s  B  of the Hong Kong High Court Ordinance  Cap   in The  Convenience Container      HKLRD    Reyes J concluded that the expression focussed      simply on matters of title  namely  the right to sell or dispose of a ship    Convenience Container       HKLRD at      Reyes J also observed that beneficial ownership was not merely concerned with control or administration of a vessel or even the enjoyment of the proceeds of its sale  He recognised that these may or may not be useful as evidence from which a finding of ownership can be made  But he held that the key question was whether the relevant person in s   had title  as  the owner  of the res in order to support its arrest  cp  Convenience Container       HKLRD at         see too per Ma CJHC

the present circumstances  I am satisfied that it is proper to draw any inference favourable to Euroceania for which there is ground in relation to Four M s role  West Asia was able to put a fuller and truer complexion on the facts  but only tendered some documents and led evidence from Mr Joshi  He said that he was not aware of what had occurred in relation to Four M beyond what he had been instructed  West Asia contended that the one share in the ship held in the name of Four M showed that it was not  the owner  of the   Gem of Safaga   for the purposes of challenging jurisdiction under s  b  of the Act  Although Euroceania had the onus of proof on this issue  the unexplained failures of West Asia to call evidence on the matters to which I have referred has enabled me to infer that such evidence would not help its case  Jones v Dunkel   HCA         CLR     CEPU   FCR at      West Asia contended that the consequence of Euroceania s argument was that the co ownership agreement  accounting entries reflecting it and registration of Four M s one share in the ship amounted to a sham  I reject that contention  There is a real difference between creating documents to cloak the reality of a different relationship and a failure to perfect or create the relationship which those documents were capable of representing  Here  I am not satisfied that on all the evidence  West Asia effectively assigned or disposed of any part of its beneficial interest in the ship that it had acquired on entry into the   February   memorandum of agreement  Hence  Four M holds its  share in the

Gummow and Kirby JJ  However  West Asia must still be a relevant person within the meaning of s  a  in one of the two ways on which Euroceania relies  Each of the connecting factors referred to in s  a   the owner  charterer   in possession or in control of  should be construed to have a distinct meaning and operation  Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority     CLR   at          esp at   per McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ  Of course  there will be some overlaps  e g  an owner or demise charterer will often be in possession of a ship and  indeed  in control of her  But a voyage or time charterer may only meet the description  charterer  in s  a   Nor does s   require that the general maritime claim be one that the plaintiff could commence as a proceeding in rem against the ship referred to in s  a  Laemthong   CLR at      And  as Gaudron  Gummow and Kirby JJ said in Laemthong   CLR at   there may be control of a ship without possession  They said that one person may have possession of a ship and another control  Their Honours gave as an example the decision of the Privy Council in The   Utopia     AC   where the owners had not given up their rights to possession of their ship just after she was wrecked but a port authority assumed control of the wreck  In giving their Lordships  advice  Sir Francis Jeune said   The  Utopia    AC at          In the present case  the Utopia was certainly not abandoned by her owners in the sense that they gave up all rights of property and possession in her  On the contrary  they no doubt always intended to raise her if they could        It is clear  however  that before the collision with the Primula the port authority of Gibraltar  represented by the acting captain of the port  took from the owners  and itself assumed  the task of protecting other vessels from the wreck by means of the signals which it directed to be employed for the purpose  The owners of the Utopia yielded to the action of the port authority  and thenceforward stood aloof from the operation of lighting the wreck  In these circumstances  it appears to their Lordships that the control and management of the wreck  so far as related to the protection of other vessels from her  and of her from them  was properly transferred to the port authority   Further  their Lordships are unable to see how any part of the conduct of the owners of the Utopia can lay them open to a charge of negligence  Neither in allowing the port authority to take on itself the control of the lighting  nor in abstaining from interfering with the subsequent action of the port authority in the matter  do their Lordships think that any default can be imputed to them  It would be dangerous if an owner of a wreck were compelled  in order to avoid a personal responsibility  to interfere with the action taken by a public authority constituted for such purposes to ensure the safety of other vessels navigating those waters    emphasis added And in Laemthong   CLR at   Toohey J  and at   Gaudron  Gummow and Kirby JJ  referred to the definitions in maritime dictionaries of a disponent owner as a  person or company who controls the commercial operation of a ship  responsible for deciding the ports of call and the cargoes to be carried  see Sullivan  The Marine Encyclopaedic Dictionary   th ed    at   Brodie  Dictionary of Shipping Terms   nd ed    at    The definition in Brodie went on to say that very often the disponent owner was a shipping line which time chartered ships and issued its own liner bills of lading  As a practical matter  West Asia had and exercised control of the commercial operation of the ships  and  by its Indian employer  Capt Venkat  giving voyage instructions to the masters  decided the ports of call and cargoes to be carried  I am satisfied that West Asia was      in control of  each of the   JBU Opal  and   JBU Onyx    The side letters provide a clear admission of that control  And the evidence establishes that West Asia exercised it  The fact that WAMS also had responsibilities under the charterparties and exercised some of them does not mean that its parent did not have control of the chartered ships for the purposes of s  a   It is not decisive that WAMS was the charterer of the ships  This does not exclude  for the purposes of s  a  there simultaneously being an owner of them  such as Euroceania  Indeed  Gaudron  Gummow and Kirby JJ rejected a construction of s  a  that at any one time there must be only one person who could answer all of the descriptions in s  a  in respect of a wrongdoing ship  Laemthong   CLR at   see too at   Brennan CJ agreeing at   and see too per Toohey J at      The conclusion that West Asia was in control of the ships by which WAMS was the charterer is also consistent with the views of the Commission in ALRC   at    cited with approval in Laemthong   CLR at   per Toohey J at     per Gaudron  Gummow and Kirby JJ  that s   could permit proceedings to be brought in rem against a ship owned by the relevant person even though that person is not the owner of the wrongdoing ship  Euroceania argued that the role assumed by West Asia under the side letters made it a charterer  It is not necessary to decide this in light of my conclusion that West Asia was in control of the chartered ships  However  I am not sure that the commercial intention was to make West Asia the charterer  Such a result does not sit easily with the language of either the charterparties themselves in which WAMS is named as charterer nor with that of the side letters that place West Asia in a position of responsibility for WAMS as the charterer  I am of opinion that West Asia was the owner of the   Gem of Safaga   at the time these proceedings were commenced and was in control of the   JBU Opal   and the   JBU Onyx   when the maritime claim arose out of the side letter agreements  That claim related to the use or hire of the latter two ships  Thus  West Asia s challenge to jurisdiction fails and its motion must be dismissed   I certify that the preceding one hundred and four   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the

owner  in s  b  are finely balanced  I am more inclined  as presently advised  to that put by West Asia  This is because the statutory right to proceed in rem should be construed  where possible  harmoniously with concepts of the maritime law forming part of the general law of nations  as Lord Mansfield CJ characterised it in Luke v Lyde   EngR         Burr   at    In The Tolten   P   at   Scott LJ reflected this approach when he said that British maritime law derived originally  and continued to get inspiration  from the general law of the sea prevailing amongst maritime nations  This reasoning lay behind the observations of the Australian Law Reform Commission  ALRC   at   that major maritime jurisdictions and the   Arrest Convention have extended the right to proceed in rem only to sister ships strictly related to those in the sole ownership  even if there is more than one co owner  of the relevant person or persons that had the requisite connection  in Australia defined in s  a  with the offending ship  The critical factual issue posed in relation to s  b  is whether Euroceania has proved that West Asia is the owner of the   Gem of Safaga    Euroceania advanced a number of arguments which  when considered with West Asia s responses  were of varying levels of complexity  First  Euroceania relied on descriptions of West Asia as sole owner of the ship in a number of public documents  West Asia sometimes appeared as owner of nine shares  and other times appeared as sole owner of the ship in various registers maintained by the Republic of India  ship classification societies and Lloyd s  However  as the variety of these entries suggests  those documents leave the issue equivocal  I am not satisfied that the entries recording West Asia as sole owner were made or continued unchanged because it had caused those recordings to be made or remain  For example  the ship classification society  the Indian Register of Shipping  has recorded West Asia as sole owner despite its surveyor at Port Suez issuing the provisional certificate of Indian Registry on behalf of the Republic of India that recorded Four M as having one of the ten shares appliedMalaysia

maritime adventure or voyage citedMead v Mead   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAnd  in contrast to Four M s generosity in not taking any payments  Mr Qadir continued to be paid during this period in excess of the amount he could draw as salary  requiring the approval of the government and then the shareholders to West Asia waiving its right to recover that excess  If he or anyone other than West Asia were beneficially interested in Four M s share of the   Gem of Safaga   it is commercially inexplicable  on the evidence before me  why no payment at all has ever been made to Four M  West Asia argued that there were two other vessels in co ownership between it and Four M and the state of accounts on those may be a reason for there having been no payments to Four M  But  that is an invitation to speculate on a matter for which West Asia could readily have provided an explanation  In these circumstances I can only draw inferences on the evidence that the parties have adduced and in light of the absence of further or countervailing evidence to explain what Four M s interest and role in holding the one share in the ship was  cp Mead v Mead   HCA

arrest is effected  is or are owned by the person who is liable for the maritime claim and who was  when the claim arose           a  owner of the ship in respect of which the maritime claim arose  or   b  demise charterer  time charterer or voyage charterer of that ship          This provision does not apply to claims in respect of ownership or possession of a ship  Mr Mitter had not found any Indian judicial interpretation of s  c  and  d  of the Indian Act  He explained that in such situations it was usual to consider English law on similar issues  He opined that the effect of s   that the effect  under Indian law  of s   was that a person was the owner  for the purposes of enlivening jurisdiction in India to arrest a ship  if he was registered under s   as owner of a share  even if there were other registered shareholders  He said that the consequence of this construction of the Indian Act was that a person would be found to be the owner so as to permit a vessel to be arrested in India even if he held only one of the   registered shares  Mr Mitter expressed the opinion that neither West Asia nor Four M could sell separately the respective nine shares or one share that they held  no doubt because of s  d  of the Indian Act  But he said that the effect of s   was that under Indian law West Asia was the owner of the   Gem of Safaga   and it could be arrested in India as security for maritime claims that had arisen against West Asia irrespective of the fact that West Asia jointly owned the ship with Four M  In MV  Sea Success I    AIR   Bombay  at     the Court held

three parties  Euroceaonia  WAMS and West Asia  They express a relationship between performance of WAMS  obligations under the charterparties and each of West Asia and WAMS  In one sense  the side letters could be thought of as being a guarantee by West Asia that its subsidiary would perform in the second class of guarantees of payment of instalments due by a principal debtor referred to by Mason CJ in Sunbird Plaza Pty Ltd v Maloney     CLR   at     i e  that a default by WAMS was also a breach of West Asia s obligations to Euroceonia because West Asia had not brought about performance by WAMS  Curiously  however  these commercial parties did not use the word  guarantee  in the side letters  There was obvious commercial sense for Euroceania to have sought some binding assurance from WAMS  more substantial part parent of the performance of a   year charter of the two ships  Importantly  the ships were to be  and were  employed as part of West Asia s fleet  Here  the side letters contain admissions by West Asia concerning its relationship to WAMS  What is the natural and ordinary meaning of a person agreeing that he is  ultimately responsible for the true fulfilment of  another s obligations under charterparty between the latter and a third party  The quoted words refer to a positive role in relation to performance of the charterparty  They are consistent with West Asia assuming a primary  or at least a joint and several  liability to Euroceania  In Sunbird Plaza   CLR at     Mason CJ  with whom Deane  Dawson and Toohey JJ agreed  said       It may be that as a matter of history the view that the guarantor has an obligation  to see to it  that the debtor performs his obligation explains why the guarantor is not entitled to notice of the debtor s default and why the creditor s cause of action arises on that default  But the view certainly does not accord with the nature of the guarantor s obligation as it is understood today  Rarely do guarantors have control of  or a capacity to influence  the principal debtor such that they would willingly assume an obligation to ensure that he performs his primary obligation   It is fictitious and quite unrealistic to suggest that this version of the guarantor s undertaking  rather than a promise to  answer for  the debt or default of the debtor  is the true nature of the guarantor s obligation    emphasis added However  Mason CJ concluded that there was no common rule applicable to all guarantees and the parties were free to make such agreement as they chose  Sunbird Plaza   CLR at    There  the guarantor undertook that  in effect  the debtor would perform its contractual obligations  In contrast  the side letters involve West Asia itself being responsible to fulfil the charterer s obligations  not merely to cause its subsidiary to do so  And  here West Asia did have control of and power to influence what WAMS did  including causing it to enter into the charterparties in the first place  The side letters demonstrate the reality of West Asia s control of WAMS  And  West Asia was in control of the   JBU Opal   and   JBU Onyx   in a practical  business sense  As the instructions of   April   to the master of the   JBU Opal   said  the commercial operations of the ship would be handled by West Asia on behalf of WAMS  I infer that this recognised the business reality that  although WAMS was the charterer  it caused the two chartered ships to operate as West Asia directed appliedTanwar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Cauchi   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au

as between Tedross and itself to remain fully liable for the performance of the purchaser s obligations  That was  in fact  the reality of what occurred when West Asia arranged all the funding for and completion of the purchase  Indeed  the terms of addendum No   referred to West Asia and Four M as the purchasers without identifying any particular share either would take on completion  That was suggestive of the two purchasing in equal shares as at   February    However  the co ownership agreement did identify proportionate interests of West Asia or Four M  The accounting and journal entries made in West Asia s books record that initially it received or paid the full amounts of hire and expenses and next apportioned these to it and Four M  This accounting treatment  however  may be a convenient way of dealing with third parties and is not conclusive in itself  West Asia also argued that the co ownership agreement prevented it from using the authority it was granted to dispose of the ship or even to mortgage it other than for the purposes of the co ownership  It contended that under that agreement West Asia only had power to dispose of its own shares in the ship  And it relied on the registration  in the official Register of Indian Shipping of the bank s mortgage against the separate entries for the shares held by West Asia and Four M  More accurately  however  cl  b

Gaudron  Gummow and Kirby JJ said in Laemthong   CLR at   there may be control of a ship without possession  They said that one person may have possession of a ship and another control  Their Honours gave as an example the decision of the Privy Council in The   Utopia     AC   where the owners had not given up their rights to possession of their ship just after she was wrecked but a port authority assumed control of the wreck  In giving their Lordships  advice  Sir Francis Jeune said   The  Utopia    AC at          In the present case  the Utopia was certainly not abandoned by her owners in the sense that they gave up all rights of property and possession in her  On the contrary  they no doubt always intended to raise her if they could        It is clear  however  that before the collision with the Primula the port authority of Gibraltar  represented by the acting captain of the port  took from the owners  and itself assumed  the task of protecting other vessels from the wreck by means of the signals which it directed to be employed for the purpose  The owners of the Utopia yielded to the action of the port authority  and thenceforward stood aloof from the operation of lighting the wreck  In these circumstances  it appears to their Lordships that the control and management of the wreck  so far as related to the protection of other vessels from her  and of her from them  was properly transferred to the port authority   Further  their Lordships are unable to see how any part of the conduct of the owners of the Utopia can lay them open to a charge of negligence  Neither in allowing the port authority to take on itself the control of the lighting  nor in abstaining from interfering with the subsequent action of the port authority in the matter  do their Lordships think that any default can be imputed to them  It would be dangerous if an owner of a wreck were compelled  in order to avoid a personal responsibility  to interfere with the action taken by a public authority constituted for such purposes to ensure the safety of other vessels navigating those waters    emphasis added followedThe Baumwoll Manufactur von Carl Scheibler v Furness   AC  West Asia has

per Allsop J  Ryan and Allsop JJ said that in the context of ss     and   of the Act the words  ownership  or  owner  connote the right to have and dispose of dominion  possession and enjoyment of the

is not necessarily the same person who will be found to be  the owner  for the purposes of s  b  of the Act    Cape Moreton     FCR at      I am not satisfied that the disparate information in the various registers establishes  individually or collectively  that West Asia is  the owner  of the ship for present purposes under s  b   Euroceania also relied on West Asia being registered as sole owner of the ship by The Britannia Steam Ship Insurance Association Limited in the protection and indemnity section of that P I Club s register  That registration was an admission by West Asia since the rules provided for the register to maintain the names of members and their interests in a ship  listing those names in order of their rights of seniority  I infer that West Asia caused and maintained its listing as sole owner  That listing was last updated on   November   well after this dispute arose  The critical issue is whether Euroceania has established  on the evidence  that whatever role Four M has it is not an owner of the ship within the meaning of s  b   In   Cape Moreton     FCR at       Ryan and Allsop JJ left open whether the use of the definite article before the word  owner  in s  b  allowed a construction that treated it as including more than one owner  Such a construction of s  b  would permit an arrest of a ship partly owned by the relevant person in s  a  but also partly owned by a stranger to the general maritime claim  see too s   of the Acts Interpretation Act which provides that  unless the contrary intention appears  words in the singular number include the plural and vice versa  I am inclined to the view that s  b  does evince a contrary intention  particularly in light of the discussion that I have quoted above from ALRC   at   and    However  I do not need to express a final view on this since I have reached a firm conclusion that West Asia is the sole person who is  the owner  of the ship for the purposes of s  b   However  in those paragraphs  Ryan and Allsop JJ were discussing other authorities  They expressed their conclusion in   Cape Moreton     FCR at       as follows           the law of Australia will govern the question of the characterisation of such rights  and their existence  nature and extent  as are derived by Freya or Alico from the transaction of transfer or assignment of the ship  The existence  nature and extent of such rights created or recognised by the transaction will be governed or affected by any law that Australian rules of private international law regard as relevant  The characterisation of those rights as  ownership  or not and of either Freya or Alico as  the owner  is then undertaken by reference to Australian law  The process involves applying an Australian statute dealing with authority to commence a suit in an Australian court to the facts as found  those facts including the rights created or recognised by the foreign law mandated by the applicable Australian rule of private international law  The approach that we favour entails a rejection of the proposition that the law of the forum  as domestic law only and not including its rules of private international law  applies  We see no justification for limiting the role of the law of the forum in this regard  To do so would  by necessity  leave out of account in the assessment of the proprietary question any foreign law relevant to the assignment of the ship  They concluded that the law of the place in which the ship is registered ordinarily will be determinative of questions of title  property and assignment    Cape Moreton     FCR at          Of course  questions of the public policy of the law of the forum and the forum s own legislation may lead to a different result  but no issue on these latter questions arose in this matter  However  the Indian Act  like similar flag state statutes  provides only for a register that is evidence of title and does not provide for a system of title by registration  Thus  no notice of any trust can be registered  see s   of the Indian Act  see too  Cape Moreton     FCR at          West Asia argued that it did not have the sole
