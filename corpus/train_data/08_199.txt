in Nystrom v Minister for Immigration   FCAFC         FCR   citedMinister for Immigration v Nystrom   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  On   November   the High Court allowed an appeal from the judgment of the Full Federal Court  Minister for Immigration v Nystrom   HCA         ALR    In consequence of the High Court s decision  on   November   the applicant was again taken into immigration detention   On   December   the applicant was interviewed by a Departmental officer while in detention at Villawood  On   December   the Department of Immigration advised the applicant that the previous cancellation of his visa was being reviewed citedSales v Minister for Immigration   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  On   January   the applicant was released from immigration detention following the decision in Sales v Minister for Immigration   FCA    This decision apparently was taken to suggest that there may have been a failure to accord the applicant procedural fairness in relation to the earlier cancellation of his visa   On   April   the Department wrote to the applicant  who was then not in custody  advising that it was giving fresh consideration as to whether his Transitional  Permanent   BF C  visa should be cancelled under s   of the Migration Act   The letter encouraged the applicant to provide the Department with all information that he wished the Minister  or a delegate  to consider in making the decision   On   April   the Department sent the applicant a   NOTICE OF INTENTION TO CONSIDER CANCELLATION OF YOUR VISA UNDER SUB SECTION   OF THE MIGRATION ACT      The Notice informed the applicant that the information to be relied upon would include his convictions for murder and attempted murder  the sentences imposed in respect of those offences and the redetermination of the sentence for murder that was made on   August    The letter advised that the information that might be taken into account included the transcript of proceedings of a number of criminal proceedings involving the applicant  as well as other material specified in the letter  The applicant was further advised that all information that he had previously provided would be taken into account in making the decision  However  he was invited to provide information and comments in relation to the application of the character test and to address any matters that he considered that the Minister should take into account when exercising the statutory discretion referred toPlaintiff S  v Commonwealth     CLR   The decision by the Minister to cancel the applicant s visa was a   privative clause decision   Migration Act s      b   Accordingly  the applicant is entitled to the relief he claims  or some variation thereof  only if he can establish that the Minister has committed jurisdictional error  Migration Act s     Plaintiff S  v Commonwealth     CLR    In my opinion  none of the grounds identified by the applicant establishes jurisdictional error by the Minister in connection with the making of the visa cancellation decision   The first ground merely asserts the existence of jurisdictional error  without providing particulars or any basis for the assertion   The second ground seems to challenge the Minister s conclusion that the applicant had a substantial criminal record for the purposes of s   of the Migration Act   It is clear  however  that the applicant satisfied the definition  He was initially sentenced to life imprisonment following his conviction for murder and  subsequently  to a redetermined sentence of   years  with a minimum custodial term of   years referred toHeatley v Tasmanian Racing and Gaming Commission   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html

Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In M  v Minister for Immigration  Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA     Kenny J made some helpful observations on the requirements of procedural fairness in relation to a Ministerial visa cancellation decision under s    Her Honour noted  at   that     Procedural fairness required that  before any decision was made  the Minister afford the applicant a fair opportunity to present information and argument against the cancellation of his visa  Precisely what constituted a fair opportunity depended on all the circumstances of the case  including the nature of the statutory power in question and the interests promoted by it  the interests of persons affected by the decision  and what was relevantly known by the decision maker at the time the decision was made   Kenny J acknowledged  at   that any visa cancellation decision made by the Minister has great importance to the person affected  However  her Honour also pointed out that    the power is conferred in order that the Minister can act in the public interest to protect of the Australian community  Under this provision  the legislature has entrusted to the Minister the responsibility for deciding whether the public interest should prevail over the private interest of a visa holder      As Gleeson CJ and Gummow J stated in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia   HCA         CLR     at   the statutory power in s   is reposed in a political official  who is a member of the Executive and accountable to Parliament and the electorate  It is therefore unlikely that Parliament contemplated that every visa cancellation decision would require the Minister  as a pre condition to the exercise of his or her powers  to afford an oral hearing to the visa holder   Of course  the requirements of procedural fairness may be onerous  even without an obligation to provide an oral hearing  Procedural fairness requires the visa holder to be given an opportunity to     rebut or qualify by further information  and comment by way of submission  upon adverse material from other sources which is put before the decision maker  It also extends to require the decision maker to identify to the person affected any issue critical to the decision which is not apparent from its nature or the terms of the statute under which it is made  The decision maker is required to advise of any adverse conclusion which has been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material       Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory
