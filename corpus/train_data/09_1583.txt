EMAS Offshore Pte Ltd v The Ship  APC Aussie    No     FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAustralian Securities and Investments Commission v DB Management Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIf the person seeking the release of the ship were not  prima facie  liable to pay all of the costs of and in connection with her custody and release  there could be a serious inhibition on the exercise by plaintiffs of their rights to arrest  And  this construction would extend the limited form of liability of a person who caused an arrest created by the Parliament in s   in cases where the power to arrest had been misused  I reject APC s argument that a defendant who seeks the release of its ship  would simply be required to provide security for the costs and expenses which the plaintiff had already paid to the Marshal in connection with its arrest  A literal meaning of the Rules does not support that construction   Australian Securities and Investments Commission v DB Management Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at           I am of opinion that at the present time the costs and expenses of the actual arrest should be paid out of the amount that EMAS has paid to the Marshal and the balance of its payment of   returned to it  And  all other costs and expenses of the Marshal  including in connection with keeping the barge in custody and its release  should be paid out of the   paid by APC to secure the release  So much of the balance of those funds  equal to what was paid out of EMAS    should be added to the amount paid into court by APC as security to abide the ultimate disposition of the proceedings  EMAS may later be able to establish its entitlement to this sum under r  C or in the substantive proceedings  This allocation of responsibility reflects the prima facie distribution of the burden of the undertakings in rr   and   which EMAS and APC respectively assumed when each of them became bound to honour them  And it ensures that the security available to EMAS will not be diminished by the costs of the arrest in the event that it is successful in the end result consideredPatrick Stevedores No   Pty Limited v Ship MV  Turakina   No       FCR  In Patrick Stevedores No   Pty Limited v Ship MV  Turakina   No       FCR   at  E F  Tamberlin J said that it was neither necessary nor appropriate to approach the undertakings  as then provided for in the Rules  on the basis that they were mutually exclusive  He also said that the undertakings did not have to be read down so as not to cover costs or expenses that may be encompassed by other undertakings that might be given by other persons  He observed that the Marshal could not claim double reimbursement in respect of the same costs or expenses  His Honour suggested that the parties should negotiate and resolve  as between themselves  the working out of the entitlements and obligations of each party who had provided an undertaking  However  this was prior to the introduction of r  C  The undertaking that form   requires extends to the whole of the period of the arrest and the release  because the applicant for release must apply under r   in accordance with form   for the release of the ship  Once the person seeking the release of the ship from arrest provides a payment to the Marshal  or a sufficient level of confidence in the undertaking given  the ship will be released  Ordinarily  the person seeking the release of the ship will be the relevant person or someone acting for the relevant person  If the arrest has been short  the costs and expenses are not likely to be large  But  if the arrest has been for a long period of time  until the relevant person has been impelled to appear or to provide the security necessary to recover the ship from arrest  prima facie  there could be a hardship on a plaintiff if APC s construction of the operation of the Rules were correct  As Tamberlin J pointed out the Marshal cannot obtain double reimbursement  In the present case  the Marshal obtained security from EMAS  in the form of cash paid pursuant to his demands  But  the Marshal did not pay any costs and expenses prior to receiving the form   and payment from APC  Giving effect to APC s argument would produce the consequence that EMAS would now have to pay all of the Marshal s costs and expenses while APC would simply provide security for those payments to be available in the event that it were held liable for them at the conclusion of the proceedings  Such a construction does not lie easily with the requirements of r   r   and form    Nor  does it sit easily with the ordinary and natural meaning of s  a ii  that limits the right of  among others  a relevant person in APC s position to recover damages from a plaintiff in EMAS  position for wrongful arrest
