and the Minister s reasons relate to the application under s   of the Protection Act  In any event  I will consider whether there is a serious question to be tried in respect of the application to this Court concerning the s   decision  As to the significance of Alum Mountain as an Aboriginal area for the purposes of s   of the Protection Act  the Minister found that the upper slopes and ridge

further  However  like Ryan J  I see much force in the reasoning of Wilcox and Lindgren JJ  Johns does not allow for the interlocutory order as sought  The Judiciary Act Section  B A c  of the Judiciary Act confers jurisdiction on the court in any matter arising under a law made by the Parliament  This would include the Protection Act  However  the limitation is that the matter must arise

      Mr Dates relies upon s  d  as the basis for the orders sought against the RTA  if joined  Mr Dates  complaints go to the merits of the decision and the weight accorded by the Minister to evidence that contradicted the evidence he presented  His complaint is that the Minister came to the wrong conclusion but that does not amount to reviewable error  Not every consideration that a decision maker is bound to take into account but fails to take into account will justify the court setting aside the impugned decision and ordering that the discretion be re exercised according to law  A factor may not be significant and a failure to take it into account could be seen not to have materially affected the decision   Peko Wallsend at    I am not satisfied that  for example  the unspecified archeological sites  if not taken into account  could have materially affected the Minister s state of satisfaction in the light of the matters referred to in the reasons  The application asserts a denial of procedural fairness in the making of the decision and manifest unreasonableness  This was not elaborated on the hearing of the motion and I am not satisfied that the particularisation of those grounds in the application discloses a serious question of reviewable error  The Minister  in his reasons  explained why he was satisfied as to the upper parts of Alum Mountain but not satisfied as to the lower parts  To repeat  the Protection Act requires a positive state of satisfaction as to areas and objects of particular significance to Aboriginals in accordance with Aboriginal tradition  Even if there were power to make an order against the RTA as sought in the notice of motion to preserve the subject matter of the s   application  Mr Dates has not established  at a prima facie level  that the Minister s decision should be the subject of orders under s   of the ADJR Act citedMinister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethnic Affairs v

v Msilanga   FCA         FCR   at     per Beaumont J  with whom Black CJ agreed   The Court also has inherent power  as a superior court of record and as a court of law and equity  to make an interlocutory order which is necessary to enable it to perform its function as such as court  This includes the power to make an order directed to preserving the subject matter of litigation   Williams No   at   per Lindgren J   That power exists independently of the power in s     Williams No   at    Mr Dates contends that an injunction is necessary to preserve the subject matter of the litigation  namely the untouched parts of Alum Mountain asserted to be of Aboriginal cultural significance  The Minister and the RTA point out that such an order extends beyond that envisaged by the relevant statutes  If the Court were to grant such an injunction it would  as the RTA submits  usurp the decision of the Minister and make  in effect  a s    emergency  declaration  Further  as the RTA observes  the Protection Act provides for injunctions that would preserve the subject matter of a declaration but the precondition is the making of a declaration  Thus  the statutory regime does not envisage an injunction pending the making of  or the determination of a challenge to a refusal to make  a declaration under s   or s    The RTA submits it is neither a proper contradictor  nor a person whose evidence will assist in the determination of whether the Minister s decisions to refuse to make the s   and s   declarations should be set aside  The RTA submits that it is  relevantly  a stranger to the Minister s decision under review  This is not affected  for the purposes of s  d  by the fact that the RTA made submissions or submitted a report to the Minister which he took into account in making his decision  The question is whether Mr Dates is otherwise entitled to injunctive relief against the RTA  whether or not it is joined as a party   Williams No   at   per Lindgren J   The right given by s    or s   of the Protection Act to any Aboriginal person to apply for a ministerial declaration does not constitute a right to claim injunctive relief against a third party nor does the general law recognise an Aboriginal person as having an interest in the specified area protectable by injunctive relief  The right given to any Aboriginal person by s   of the Protection Act does not constitute such an interest    Williams No   at    Joinder for the purpose of granting an interlocutory injunction to prevent the RTA from proceeding with the works would afford Mr Dates rights greater than those available under the Protection Act  which does not provide for injunctions per se and in the absence of a declaration  Joinder would also afford rights greater than those under the ADJR Act which  if Mr Dates were successful  could at its highest result in remittal to the Minister for redetermination of his decision  The Minister submits that the RTA may be proper but not a necessary party to the substantive proceedings but that it is not a proper or necessary party to the motion if there is no power in the Court to grant the injunctive relief sought in the notice
