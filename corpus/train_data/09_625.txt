Singleton  in the matter of Mad Canoe Advertising Pty Ltd  in Liq    FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedO Reilly v Alderson   EngR         Hare     ER  The correct analysis seems to be that while MCA is in liquidation  it is disqualified from performing its duties and exercising its powers under the Unit Trust Deed  but continues to hold the property of the Trust upon a constructive trust by the operation of general law principles  It is an interesting question what the terms of the constructive trust are  It may be that MCA simply holds the property upon a passive constructive trust for these unit holders in equal shares  It may also be that upon termination of the winding up  MCA again assumes the role of trustee under the express terms of the Unit Trust Deed  cf O Reilly v Alderson   EngR         Hare     ER    I am not called upon to decide these questions  In one way or another  it is clear that MCA will resume its position as trustee under the express terms of the Unit Trust Deed  Clause       of that Deed provides that with the unanimous consent of the unit holders in writing or by special resolution of the unit holders in general meeting  the unit holders are entitled to appoint a trustee in place of any trustee who is disqualified  It would not be in the interests of any of the unit holders to obstruct the passing of such a resolution if it should be thought necessary  Moreover  RSW and MMI have paid SC the purchase price for its units  and could compel SC to join with them in reappointing MCA as trustee  if this should be thought necessary in order to enable the unit transfers to be registered  It was for the above reasons that I was satisfied that MCA was solvent and that I ordered the winding up should be terminated   I certify that the preceding thirty seven   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lindgren      Associate     Dated    June     Solicitor for the Plaintiffs  Mr D M Crompton of Church   Grace Date of Hearing    May   Date of Judgment    May         AustLII  Copyright Policy   Disclaimers   Privacy Policy   Feedback   URL  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html
