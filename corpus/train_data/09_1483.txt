ought to be accepted is a matter for the meeting  It is not for the Court to substitute its own view of the merits of the vote  for that of the meeting  If  of course  the meeting reaches a conclusion

about any matter that might seem to the Court counter intuitive  Even so  the will of the meeting is paramount subject to the supervision of the Court  If the material clearly explains the proposal and it is capable of acceptance by individuals exercising their best judgment of what is in their own commercial interests or to their own commercial advantage  the Court ought not to withhold
