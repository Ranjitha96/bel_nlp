SBCC v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toWang v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  I do not consider that the Tribunal s reasons leading to its finding that the applicant fabricated his claim to have been a Falun Gong practitioner from mid   disclose jurisdictional error on its part in the way asserted  It was entitled to test the applicant s knowledge of Master Li s teachings  as relevant to that issue  It does not flow from its reasons  either explicitly or implicitly  that it was prescribing a specific level of doctrinal knowledge as a precondition to the applicant  or anyone  being accepted as a Falun Gong practitioner  cf Wang v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR   at      I do not therefore need to determine whether such a prescription  especially if based upon the Tribunal s understanding of the particular religion which is not accepted by an applicant or not supported by identified material  might involve jurisdictional error  The applicant did not claim in the course of the hearing that the Tribunal s questions did not relate to Master Li s teachings  and accepted that he did not have a deep level of knowledge of those teachings  His explanation for that was that he had not been practising for a long time citedMashayekhi v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In my view  the Tribunal s finding of fact that the applicant had been untruthful  in particular about his claim to have been a Falun Gong practitioner since mid   was reached without jurisdictional error  It was based upon the way the applicant responded to the Tribunal s questions on a number of matters  and upon his own evidence as to the nature of what he claimed to have done as a Falun Gong practitioner until mid   and that he had a  quite superficial  knowledge of Falun Gong  The foundations for its finding of fact were reasonably open to it  No jurisdictional error is demonstrated by the Tribunal making a finding on credibility reasonably available on the material available  Mashayekhi v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR   at     The fact of that fabrication of his early involvement with Falun Gong  together with his limited knowledge of Falun Gong  as the applicant himself acknowledged  then lead the Tribunal not to be satisfied that the applicant s involvement in Falun Gong more recently was otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening his claim to be a refugee  Section  R  of the Act directed the Tribunal  in those circumstances  to disregard the applicant s more recent Falun Gong involvement  It followed that the Tribunal was not satisfied of his grounds for seeking a protection visa  It was therefore required by s   to affirm the delegate s decision and to refuse the protection visa sought   The second claim of jurisdictional error was based upon apprehended bias  It was initially argued that the Tribunal must reasonably be apprehended to have pre judged the applicant s claim by assuming that each follower and believer of the Falun Gong would know and understand that level of doctrinal knowledge which the Tribunal expected  Counsel for the applicant in the course of submissions accepted that the contention limited in that way did not really advance the applicant s claim  as  if he did not succeed on the first ground  he could not succeed on the alternative ground  However  the contention was then developed by during to the course of the hearing citedWebb v The Queen   HCA
