Austcan Investments Pty Ltd   HCA         ALR   citedAyoub v Euphoric Pty Ltd     BPR     NSWCA   In my opinion  counsel for the defendants is correct in submitting that a Jones v Dunkel inference is also available because of the failure by Aon to call evidence from those involved in the negotiations for Macquarie Underwriting  particularly Stuart Coleman  The availability of a Jones v Dunkel inference in the case of a witness who is a third party can be a difficult issue  Macquarie and Aon are not in the  same camp  and Coleman is not under the control of Aon  In a sense  he was available to both parties  However  only the broker  Aon  had dealings with the potential insurer  The client was not  and would never be  directly in that loop  Between the parties here  it was natural for Aon rather than the defendants to call the evidence from those at Macquarie Underwriting who were involved in the dealings between Aon and Macquarie from the inception of business and in the subsequent management of the business including the proposed renewal  The failure to lead this evidence further buttresses the inference in favour of the defendants   Payne v Parker     NSWLR   per Glass JA at

Hails Moretti Pty Ltd   NSWSC         ALR     The statutory claims remain to be considered  Counsel for the plaintiffs ultimately conceded that he could find no support for assignability of these causes of action  That is correct  That relieves me from deciding the point  I should say that the concession would follow  directly or indirectly  from a long line of authority in this Court that is against assignment of a claim for damages pursuant to s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  commencing with Park v Allied Mortgages Corp Ltd   ATPR  Digest       Those cases were recently reviewed and followed by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR         IPR   at     in relation to claims made pursuant to s   for breaches of s   and s  AC of the Trade Practices Act    It follows that the purported assignment of each cause of action is ineffective  I should add that if the assignment is ineffective  it is so for all purposes  It follows that Tosich retains the causes of action regardless of the deed  That transaction has no relevant impact upon his claims  There is no evidence as to the arrangements between Tosich and All Saints in the eventuality of the assignment being ineffective  Such evidence would be as irrelevant to this case as would any other side arrangements between parties such as insurance   Aon directly pleads limitation defences  The defendants adopt a  coat tails  approach  Aon has taken the running on the issue  The starting point is that Tosich was reintroduced to the proceeding as a plaintiff by amendment on   May    The next step is that   May   is taken to be the date of the commencement of the proceeding by Tosich by virtue of O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   It is then contended that all relevant causes of action accrued on or about   November   when the money was paid by Tosich  The last step is that each cause of action is barred  either by particular limitations in the Corporations Law or by the Limitation Act    NSW  applicable by virtue of s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth   There is little to recommend such a result  It would be a triumph of form over substance  Tosich commenced the proceeding on   November   well within all potential limitation periods  All Saints was substituted for Tosich as plaintiff by order of the Court on   April   claiming to be an assignee of the Tosich causes of action  The substantive causes of action remained the same at all times  Thus  the defendants faced the same causes of action at all times  The cross defendants faced the same cross claims at all times  However  lack of merit alone is not an answer to the point followedCaldwell v JA Neilson Investments Pty Ltd     ANZ Ins Cas       NSWCA  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  The unexplained omission by Aon to draw the attention of the client to such an important consequence of the overall insurance arrangements that were in

valid  recognised by the authorities cited in Poulton   CLR   at   is an assignment of property  even though the property may be incapable of being recovered without litigation or  as it was put by Lord Roskill in Trendtex   AC   at   where the cause of action is incidental to a right of property that has been acquired  There is no reason why such a cause of action could not include tort in an appropriate case eg detinue or conversion  However  based upon the submissions in this case  examples of the practical application of the principle are sparse  Re Daley  Ex parte National Australia

can be no doubt that there was a causal connection between the negligence and each of the identified statutory breaches  and the loss making investment by Tosich  Each cause of action is established against Tasman Investments  There is no doubt about Warne s personal liability for all causes of action so established  He was the moving force for Tasman Investments in all respects relevant to the investment in the Queen Victoria Project and is responsible for all acts and omissions giving rise to the liability of the company   Houghton v Arms   HCA         CLR     The deed of assignment was executed on   June   between Tosich as assignor and All Saints as assignee  At that time this proceeding was on foot  and a receiver had been appointed to the Queen Victoria Project by the Supreme Court of New South Wales in proceedings brought by ASIC  The substantive operative provisions of the deed were as follows         The assignee will pay to the assignors by bank or trust account cheque the sum of One Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars   on the exchange of this Deed       The assignors hereby transfer set over and assign to the assignee absolutely all of their right  title and interest both at law and in equity in              a  the investment in their names in the Queen Victoria Project referred to in recital A     b  all rights to receive any dividend or other monies from or by virtue of the receivership of the Queen Victoria Project referred to in recital C     c  all claims demands causes of action and rights of action maintainable by the assignors or either of them arising out of or connected with the facts matters and circumstances referred to in the statement of claim filed in the Tosich proceedings  There are other features of the deed to note  The first is that the defendants Tasman Investment and Warne were each party to the deed and gave joint and several warranties as to the financial position of the assignee and Warne  They also  together with the assignee  indemnified the assignors against future legal costs and expenses in the proceeding  and covenant that they will not seek costs or expenses from the assignors in relation to this proceeding  Then there are clauses dealing with later recovery as follows         If the receiver declares and pays a dividend in respect of the Queen Victoria Project prior to the conclusion of the Tosich proceedings and the connected proceedings  that dividend will be paid to the assignors once the Tosich proceedings and the connected proceedings have been finally concluded  If the receiver declares and pays a dividend in respect of the Queen Victoria Project once the Tosich proceedings and the connected proceedings have been finally concluded  that dividend will be paid to the assignors forthwith       In circumstances where the assignors become entitled to any further payments consequent upon any award or judgment obtained by it  Tasman and or Warne  the assignors shall be entitled to a further payment equivalent to         a       b  plus interest which is hereby agreed in the amount of   plus    c  costs and disbursements which are hereby agreed in the amount of   inclusive of GST    less any amount paid pursuant to this Deed  appliedJones v Dunkel     CLR   Based upon the evidence  it can be inferred that if Aon had approached Macquarie Underwriting on the basis that the financial planning business was in truth a continuing business  although carried on by another entity  that PI insurance would have been issued as if it were a renewal on terms no less favourable than the quote given as to premium and with retroactive cover to Tasman Investment and Warne to at least the inception of business and on the basis that prior known circumstances would be covered  At the very least  the evidence required an explanation from Aon as to precisely what occurred between it and Macquarie Underwriting  That explanation may  in turn  have required an explanation from Macquarie Underwriting  Counsel for the defendants is on strong ground in relying upon the unexplained failure of Aon to call any witness of its own  particularly either or both of Elia and Kazakova  A clear Jones v Dunkel inference is to be drawn   Jones v Dunkel     CLR    The consequence is that the inference available from the evidence that a renewal on suitable terms to cover the Tasman Investment run off would have been available from Macquarie Underwriting can be more readily  and is  drawn   In my opinion  counsel for the defendants is correct in submitting that a Jones v Dunkel inference is also available because of the failure by Aon to call evidence from those involved in the negotiations for Macquarie Underwriting  particularly Stuart Coleman  The availability of a Jones v Dunkel inference in the case of a witness who is a third party can be a difficult issue  Macquarie and Aon are not in the  same camp  and Coleman is not under the control of Aon  In a sense  he was

assessment on the balance of probabilities as to whether an event did or did not happen  Furthermore  in considering this case  it is to be borne in mind that Aon prevented the posited situation occurring and that it  not the defendants  was the expert in the field  See  generally  Cee Bee Marine Ltd v Lombard Insurance Co Ltd     NZLR   at      The reconstruction of events in this case does not depend upon what the defendants would have done in a particular situation in the sense discussed by Buchanan JA in Crown Insurance Services Pty Ltd v National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd     ANZ Ins Cas     at      It principally  but not entirely  depends upon the assessment as to what others would have done  It is to be noted that the discussion of this question by Ashley J in TBI Pty Ltd v Aon Financial Planning Ltd     ANZ Ins Cas     at     was tentative obiter dicta citedManchester Unity Total Care Building Society v MGICA Ltd     ANZ Ins Cas     There could  no doubt  be a case where the circumstances are such that it can be taken that any reasonable insured would know that any insurer would regard them as relevant to cover of the risk proposed without the benefit of evidence from the insurer or broker  It may be that the position arrived at by September October   would fall into that category so far as PI insurance in relation to run off insurance for Tasman Investments was concerned  A fund raising that was advised to be likely to be in breach of the Corporations Law was clearly failing  with the investors likely to suffer considerable losses  In my opinion  the same cannot be said of the circumstances in March early April    The likelihood of loss on the investment was not known  The possibility of breaches of the law in relation to the fund raising was known  but that is as high as it reached at that point  That was likely to be academic if the project succeeded  The relevance of that circumstance to a particular insurer needs to be established by evidence  It is conceivable that such evidence could have been led  but it was not  For the Court to fill that gap and make a finding as to that issue would amount to speculation  I conclude that it has not been established that a failure to disclose the pleaded circumstances would have given rise to any relief in relation to the hypothetical Macquarie Underwriting policy  The same reasoning would apply in relation to the application of s     Manchester Unity Total Care Building Society v MGICA Ltd     ANZ Ins Cas       I am  thus  satisfied that the proper basis for quantification of loss is to assume that a Macquarie Underwriting policy would have issued based upon the proposal it received  including Tasman Investment as an insured with a retroactive date at least back to the inception of the business in    The policy would  thus  have responded to claims made in the period from March   to March   arising from circumstances occurring in June November    Such claims would have clearly fallen clearly within the insured risk and there has been no suggestion of any relevant exception  Allowance will have to be made for the proposed deductible of   per claim  Some allowance should be made for the higher premium proposed by Macquarie Underwriting  It would not be right in principle to allocate all of that increase to the one claim by Tosich  The amount recovered of     should be deducted  There should also be a modest discount to reflect the possibility that a policy on appropriate terms might not have issued  All in all  the cross claimants should recover the sum of   plus interest in relation to Tosich   Little attention was paid to the claims in relation to Roach and Kotwal and no special defence was raised in relation to them  The fact that they were paid out is of no consequence as there was no relevant policy in force at the time  The only distinction is that they were made later than that by Tosich  If proper insurance had been obtained  that should not have been relevant  The quantification of these claims needs to be further considered citedMartinus v Kidd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA

provisions  In Martinus v Kidd   HCA         CLR   it was pointed out that no new cause of action comes into being against the personal representative of a deceased tortfeasor the existing cause of action survives  In that case  time runs for limitation purposes from accrual of the cause of action against the deceased  see per Gibbs CJ  Murphy and Wilson JJ at   Mason J at    The same principle must be applicable in relation to a cause of action that survives for the benefit of the personal representation of the deceased estate  absent any special provisions  That principle applies to an action by a trustee in bankruptcy to enforce a liability of the bankrupt   Re Mansell  Ex parte Norton     LT    The same principle should apply in the case of the assignment of a cause of action  The original cause of action remains the foundation of the action  although not directly applicable  see   The Jordan Nicolov      Lloyds Reps   per Hobhouse J at   Lefevre v White     Lloyd s Reps   per Popplewell J at   citing Post Office v Norwich Fire Insurance Ltd     QB   per Lord Denning at   cf per Jacobs J in Re Harry Simpson   Company Pty Ltd and Companies Act       NSWR   at       WN  Pt    NSW    at    In the present case  the same causes of action have been pursued at all times appliedTrendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse   AC   This area of the law is controversial  Choses in action in general are assignable  eg s   Conveyancing Act    NSW   However  a bare right to litigate requires special consideration  Although maintenance was referred to in this context  no submissions were directed to the effect of the Maintenance  Champerty and Barratry Abolition Act    NSW   cf Campbell J in Mid City Skin Cancer and Laser Centre Pty Ltd v Zahedi Anarak     NSWLR   at    It is convenient to discuss the cause of action in negligence first  In   the High Court  in Poulton v Commonwealth     CLR   at   in relation to a claim in conversion  baldly said         according to well established principle  the right was incapable of assignment either at law or in equity      Lord Roskill said in Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse   AC   at  C     Though in general choses in action were assignable  yet causes of action which were essentially personal in their character  such as claims for defamation or personal injury  were incapable of assignment     One well established category where an assignment is valid  recognised by the authorities cited in Poulton   CLR   at   is an assignment of property  even though the property may be incapable of being recovered without litigation or  as it was put by Lord Roskill in Trendtex   AC   at   where the cause of action is incidental to a right of property that has been acquired  There is no reason why such a cause of action could not include tort in an appropriate case eg detinue or conversion  However  based upon the submissions in this case  examples of the practical application of the principle are sparse  Re Daley  Ex parte National Australia Bank Ltd     FCR   was cited but the decision turned on what was held to be the assignment of a debt   FCR at      In Monk v Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd     NSWLR   there had been no assignment of the cheques that would have constituted the necessary property  In that case  Cohen J referred to the decision of Gault J in First City Corporation Ltd v Downsview Nominees Ltd     NZLR   where it was held  at   that the assignment of a debenture by a parent company to a subsidiary included an assignment of causes of action in tort against a receiver of the company that issued the debenture and that the causes of action in tort were ancillary to the assignment of the debenture and so valid  The effect of that decision is somewhat clouded by the subsequent appellate history of the case   First City Corporation Ltd v Downsview Nominees Ltd     NZLR   Downsview Nominees Ltd v First City Corporation Ltd   AC   although the appeals did not turn upon the point in issue here   The decision of Finkelstein J in TS   B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v  Fold Resources Pty Ltd  No       FCR   may be seen as an example of the category of connection with property  There  the assignment of a cause of action for breach of confidential information  connected with or relating to rights of property that were assigned  was upheld  see particularly   FCR   at      However  that decision  and others since   have been influenced by dicta of Lord Wilberforce and Lord Roskill in Trendtex   AC   indicating another basis for exception from the general rule whether the assignee has a  genuine and substantial interest in the success of the     litigation   per Lord Wilberforce at  D  or has a  genuine commercial interest in the enforcement of the claim of another   per Lord Roskill at  D    Finkelstein J took the wider view in TS   B Retail Systems Pty Ltd   FCR   and suggested that the High Court in Campbell s Cash and Carry Pty Ltd v Fostif Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   had approved the effect of the statements by Lords Wilberforce and Roskill in Trendtex   AC    The precise point that arises here did not arise in Campbell s Cash and Carry Pty Ltd   HCA       CLR    However  the reasoning of Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ at     and Callinan and Heydon JJ at     supports the opinion of Finkelstein J  In my opinion  the principle enunciated in Trendtex   AC   can be taken to be established for Australia  It needs to be borne in mind that the statement in Poulton   CLR   was not the centre of controversy in that case   Did All Saints have a genuine commercial interest in the enforcement of Tosich s claim  There is no direct evidence concerning the position of All Saints prior to the transaction  The inescapable inference from all the circumstances  including the structure of the transaction  is that All Saints was under the control of the Warne interests and that the transaction was to ensure that this proceeding continued notwithstanding a reluctance to pursue it on the part of Tosich  In particular  it seems to be aimed at removing or minimising Tosich s risk as to costs  It may be inferred that the purpose was to provide a vehicle for the defendants to pursue their cross claims with the benefit of a claim proved by a plaintiff  That would remove the kind of problem exemplified by CGU Insurance Ltd v AMP Financial Planning Pty Ltd   HCA         ALR         ALJR         ACSR    Indeed  as much was made clear by counsel for the plaintiffs and for the defendants on various occasions  I do not see anything objectionable about that purpose or about the structure of the transaction  All Saints could not profit from the arrangement  It is not  trafficking  in causes of actions in any real sense  Facilitation of cross claims to be determined on their merits is not objectionable as such  However  it seems to me that the dicta in Trendtex   AC   would have to be extended to include these circumstances within the permissible categories of assignment  The assignee is not shown to have had any interest in the claim prior to  or regardless of  the assignment  In view of the controversy surrounding the topic  an extension of the categories is not the province of a single judge   What  then  of the connection with property  Austin J found that there were property interests created by the scheme  The deed purports to assign those interests and causes of action  including the present  In one sense  there is a clear connection  The intention is to recover the loss of property invested  However  the claim in negligence is not to recover the property that existed at the time of the transaction it is to recover the loss by way of damages  In my opinion  that is not the kind of claim connected with property that is covered by the traditional exception to the rule against assignment of causes of action  assuming  as I do  that the exception can include claims in tort where appropriate  The assignment of the cause of action in tort is not effective   In the course of argument  counsel for the plaintiffs referred to a claim for money had and received  The Third Amended Originating Process claims  inter alia     Orders in the nature of restitutionary orders for the refund to the Plaintiffs of the moneys originally invested in the Queen Victoria Project by the First Plaintiff and interest      The Third Amended Statement of Claim does not include pleading to support that claim and no amendment has been sought  Such a claim can be ignored for present purposes followedTS   B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v  Fold Resources Pty Ltd  No       FCR   The decision of Finkelstein J in TS   B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v  Fold Resources Pty Ltd  No       FCR   may be seen as an example of the category of connection with property  There  the assignment of a cause of action for breach of confidential information  connected with or relating to

opinion  counsel for the defendants is correct in submitting that a Jones v Dunkel inference is also available because of the failure by Aon to call evidence from those involved in the negotiations for Macquarie Underwriting  particularly Stuart Coleman  The availability of a Jones v Dunkel inference in the case of a witness who is a third party can be a difficult issue  Macquarie and Aon are not in the  same camp  and Coleman is not under the control of Aon  In a sense  he was available to both parties  However  only the broker  Aon  had dealings with the potential insurer  The client was not  and would never be  directly in that loop  Between the parties here  it was natural for Aon rather than the defendants to call the evidence from those at Macquarie Underwriting who were involved in the dealings between Aon and Macquarie from the inception of business and in the subsequent management of the business including the proposed renewal  The failure to lead this evidence further buttresses the inference in favour of the defendants   Payne v Parker     NSWLR   per Glass JA at     Prasad v Minister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethnic Affairs   FCA         ALR   at

the  matter  must also be known to be relevant to the decision of the particular insurer whether to accept risk  and  if so  on what terms in this case  on the basis put forward  by Macquarie Underwriting  As Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd   HCA       CLR   at          Under the Act  attention is shifted from the prudent insurer to the particular insurer
