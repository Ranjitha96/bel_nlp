more general considerations  a comment endorsed by Lord Wilberforce in Irwin at     Liverpool City Council v Irwin   UKHL       AC     Liverpool   concerned multi story council owned dwellings  The landlord retained control over common parts of the building  There had been a problem with vandalisation of the common parts  The question was whether the landlord was obliged to keep the common parts in repair  There was no express obligation to that effect in the leases  The House of Lords implied an obligation to take reasonable care to keep the common parts in reasonable repair and useability  After identifying instances of implication  including where there is an established usage in the relevant trade or activity and where without a term the contract will not work  Lord Wilberforce said at   The present case  in my opinion  represents a fourth category  or I would rather say a fourth shade on a continuous spectrum  The court here is simply concerned to establish what the contract is  the parties not having themselves fully stated the terms  In this sense the court is searching for what must be implied   After considering various possible implications  his Lordship went on at   In order to be able to choose between these  it is necessary to define what test is to be applied  and I do not find this difficult  In my opinion such obligation should be read into the contract as the nature of the contract itself implicitly requires  no more  no less  a test  in other words  of necessity   He then explained  by reference to the relationship between the parties  landlord and tenant  and the nature of the buildings  multi occupation high rise dependent on stairs  lifts and chutes for access and liveability  that it was necessary that the landlord have some obligation to keep the common areas in repair  His Lordship concluded that since the test of the existence of the term was  necessity  the standard of repair required should not exceed what was necessary having regard to the circumstances   The  necessity  test was adopted by the Privy Council in Tai Hing Cotton Mill Ltd v Liu Chong Hing Bank Ltd   AC   at      The Board referred to Lord Salmon s explication of  necessity  in Liverpool   that the term sought to be implied must be one without which the whole transaction would become  inefficacious  futile and absurd    Their Honours then quoted with approval

appellant s contention that a contract for the supply of a computer program carries with it an implied licence to use the program and call for the source code is a claim for Chitty s  standardised  implied term that is not dependent on the intentions of the parties  actual or presumed  In order to determine whether the  necessity  test in Liverpool and the later cases is satisfied in relation to contracts for the supply of computer programs  it is necessary to consider the provisions of Division  A of Part III of the Act   This Division was inserted by the Copyright Amendment  Computer Programs  Act     It is headed Acts not constituting infringements of copyright in computer programs   Section  AB provides that in Division  A  computer program includes any literary work that is   i  incorporated in  or associated with  a computer program  and  ii  essential to the effective operation of a function of that computer program   That section builds on the definition of  computer program  in s   which is in Part II Interpretation   a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result   Section  D  which is headed Reproducing computer programs to make interoperable products   provides        Subject to this Division  the copyright in a literary work that is a computer program is not infringed by the making of a reproduction or adaptation of the work if           a  the reproduction or adaptation is made by  or on behalf of  the owner or licensee of the copy of the program  the original program  used for making the reproduction or adaptation  and   b  the reproduction or adaptation is made for the purpose of obtaining information necessary to enable the owner or licensee  or a person acting on behalf of the owner or licensee  to make independently another program  the new program  or an article  to connect to and be used together with  or otherwise to interoperate with  the original program or any other program  and   c  the reproduction or adaptation is made only to the extent reasonably necessary to obtain the information referred to in paragraph  b  and   d  to the extent that the new program reproduces or adapts the original program  it does so only to the extent necessary to enable the new program to connect to and be used together with  or otherwise to interoperate with  the original program or the other program  and   e  the information referred to in paragraph  b  is not readily available to the owner or licensee from another source when the reproduction or adaptation is made            Subsection   does not apply to the making of a reproduction or adaptation of a computer program from an infringing copy of the computer program citedTai Hing Cotton Mill

Airlines Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The implication of terms  independent of intention  was considered in some detail in the judgment of McHugh and Gummow JJ in Byrne v Australian Airlines Ltd   HCA         CLR     Byrne    At     their Honours said  What  then  is involved in the proposition that a contractual term is implied as a matter of law rather than as the assumed intention of the parties  There is at least one basic distinction  It is that     terms implied by the application of what one might call the business efficacy test are terms unique to the particular contract in question  depending upon the form of the contract  the express terms and the surrounding circumstances  By contrast  terms implied by law are  in general  implied in all contracts of a particular class or which answer a given description   Later at   their Honours said  Many of the terms now said to be implied by law in various categories of case reflect the concern of the courts that  unless such a term be implied  the enjoyment of the rights conferred by the contract would or could be rendered nugatory  worthless  or  perhaps  be seriously undermined  Hence  the reference in the decisions to  necessity   This notion of  necessity  has been crucial in the modern cases in which the courts have implied for the first time a new term as a matter of law   In Byrne at   Brennan CJ  Dawson and Toohey JJ approved the following passage from the reasons of Deane J in Hawkins v Clayton   HCA         CLR   at   The most that can be said consistently with the need for some degree of flexibility is that  in a case where it is apparent that the parties have not attempted to spell out the full terms of their contract  a court should imply a term by reference to the imputed intention of the parties if  but only if  it can be seen that the implication of the particular term is necessary for the reasonable or effective operation of a contract of that nature in the circumstances of the case   No term such as that sought by the appellant can be supported on the business efficacy basis  The existence of ss  D and  E show that the implication of the term is not necessary for the reasonable or effective operation of the particular contract in the circumstances of the case   As part of its implied term case the appellant submitted that regardless of whether the respondent was its employee or an independent contractor  the purchase of a computer program includes  ipso facto  the source code  This was said to be so because of what counsel described as the  definition of   a computer program in s   of the Act  For the purposes of this Act  a computer program is taken to have been reproduced if   a  an object code version of the program is derived from the program in source code by any process including compilation  or  b  a source code version of the program is derived from the program in object code by any process  including decompilation  and any such version is taken to be a reproduction of the program referred toScally v Southern Health and Social Services Board     AC   Their Honours then quoted with approval the passage from Lord

au au cases cth HCA  html  The appellant complained that the Magistrate imposed on it the burden of establishing that it had a licence to use the source code  whereas the burden lay on the respondent to show that the appellant did not have such a licence  It relied on Avel v Multicoin Amusements Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at      However all that was there decided was that the onus of proving the absence of the licence of the owner of copyright in relation to an issue of infringement under s   or s   of the Act lies on the party asserting infringement  That is because the absence of such licence constitutes an element of the wrong of infringement under those sections  The present case is not for infringement of copyright  and the onus submission fails distinguishedTSB Retail Systems Pty Ltd v  Fold Resources Pty Ltd  No       IPR   The same onus submission was made in relation to defects the appellant submitted existed in the program  The respondent disputed their existence  The appellant contended that the burden was on the respondent to prove there were no defects  Reliance was placed on TSB Retail Systems Pty Ltd v  Fold Resources Pty Ltd  No       IPR   at    That was an infringement case  One of the defences was that the respondent was authorised to reproduce the drawings there in question  Finkelstein J said that the copyright owner had the onus of proving the absence of authorisation  for that is an element of the cause of action for copyright infringement    The burden of proving the existence of defects remained with the appellant  The Magistrate was not

www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The parties were basically in agreement as to the law to be applied in answering this question  In Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   Mason J said  A prominent factor in determining the nature of the relationship between a person who engages another to perform work and the person so engaged is the degree of control which the former can exercise over the latter      But the existence of control  whilst significant  is not the sole criterion by which to gauge whether a relationship is one of employment  The approach of this Court has been to regard it merely as one of a number of indicia which must be considered in the determination of that question      Other relevant matters include  but are not limited to  the mode of remuneration  the provision and maintenance of equipment  the obligation to work  the hours of work and provision for holidays  the deduction of income tax and the delegation of work by the putative employee   The cases have identified many indicia  in addition to those to which Mason J referred  that are relevant to the inquiry  See  for example  Vabu Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     ATR   at   and D   D Tolhurst Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue     ATR   at       The Magistrate first instructed herself in accordance with the relevant authorities  including those referred to above  She then noted various indicia relevant to the characterisation process  They included that the respondent was a sole operator  had an ABN  sent invoices which included GST  used his own motor vehicle and secretarial facilities without expenses or allowances from the appellant  was at liberty to take other work  worked at home without supervision  and attended meetings with the appellant s clients without the appellant being present  Her Honour also recorded that the appellant did not advise the Tax Office that the respondent was its employee and did not deduct PAYE  Nor was the respondent provided with sick leave  annual leave or superannuation  The Magistrate referred to other indicia  pointing one way or the other  See   to     The appellant summarised its complaints about the Magistrate s characterisation of the respondent s work status in three propositions   a  her Honour was incorrect in deciding that the indicia she relied upon were the correct set of indicia and were exhaustive of the determination of that issue   b  her Honour ignored or gave little or no regard to concrete written expressions by the respondent of his intentions as to the nature and terms of  the employment   c  her Honour gave no weight or no sufficient weight to   i  the nature of the relationship between the parties  including industry practice  and   ii   implications that should arise as a consequence of the need to give business efficacy to the agreement    In a comprehensive and detailed set of reasons on this issue  covering sixteen pages  the Magistrate dealt with many matters other than those to which she ultimately accorded particular weight  including those the subject of particular complaint in pars  b  and  c  at    Having done so  her Honour announced her conclusion as follows  Taking into account all of the matters mentioned above and considering the matter as a whole  it is clear to me that the respondent worked for the applicant as an independent contractor  The respondent had his own ABN  He charged the applicant GST  The applicant claimed an input tax credit for the GST  The applicant did not  deduct  pay as you go income tax instalment deductions from the amounts paid to the respondent  The respondent charged the applicant a fixed price for the work  The respondent was given no holiday pay  sick pay  superannuation or workers compensation insurance  The respondent was free to take other work and did including other work from the Salvation Army  The respondent  in my view  was clearly in business on his own account  Notwithstanding that Mr Roberts exercised some control over the overall direction of the project  and the respondent was doing a major job for the applicant  the respondent was not an employee   The Magistrate did not treat the matters recorded in the second to seventh sentences of that passage as a  correct set of indicia   They were the matters that appealed to her as determinative after weighing and balancing a much larger range of indicia  including those relied on by the appellant  On a fair reading of the Magistrate s reasons  it cannot be said that the list of specific matters recorded in the passage quoted at   was propounded as  exhaustive of the determination of that question    For the same reason I do not accept Counsel s oral variation of the  correct set of indicia  submission  This was that the Magistrate ticked off the matters on her check list and thus reached the wrong result because the list was incomplete   For the foregoing reasons there is in my view no substance in complaint  a  at     The  concrete written expressions  of the respondent s intentions as to the  nature and terms of his employment  in complaint  b  at   were twofold  The first was that in his  Proposal to Develop a Call Centre Application  sent to Mr Roberts on   May   he described himself as  Centre Stage Management Development Manager  Tony Riedle   As to the significance of this title  the Magistrate said  The applicant says that this means that the respondent acknowledged that he was not an independent contractor but that he occupied a position as a designated employee of the applicant  In my view  that reads too much into the title the respondent gave himself  The proposal was to be provided to the Salvation Army  As between the applicant and the Salvation Army  the respondent was on the applicant s team  That was sufficient to explain the respondent s description of his position  The description does not seem to me to indicate that the respondent was holding himself out as an employee  In any event  it would only be evidence of his view at the time  As previously stated  I do not consider the views of the parties  or even their solicitors  to be of significant weight in the context of this case   An understanding of some basic concepts involved in the construction of a computer program assists in understanding the appellant s implied term argument  The following description of the general nature of a computer program is taken from the judgment of Gibbs CJ in Computer Edge Pty Ltd v Apple Computer Inc   HCA         CLR   at      A computer program is a set of instructions designed to cause a computer to perform a particular function or to produce a particular result  A program is usually developed in a number of stages  First  the sequence of operations the computer will be required to perform is commonly written out in ordinary language  Next a source program is prepared  usually in a source code which is human readable  The source code cannot be used directly in the computer  and must first be converted into an object code  which is machine readable  The program is executed by the computer s central processing unit  See Data Access Corporation v Powerflex Services Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    referred toRoy Morgan Research Centre Pty v Commissioner of State Revenue  Victoria    ATR   In Roy Morgan Research Centre Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue  Victoria      ATR   at   the Victorian Court of Appeal said that the determination of the employee independent contractor question involves identifying factors or indicia that are capable of pointing in one direction or another  none of which is conclusive  and weighing or balancing them in order to reach a conclusion   Another indicator that the respondent saw himself as an employee is said to lie in the words used on the front of the proposal to the Salvation Army   The information in this proposal is  proprietary  and is for the sole use of Centre Stage Management in conjunction with the Salvation Army Family Stores   This was said to demonstrate  his view of the terms of the agreement and it was not that he owned the copyright   The Magistrate said this did not greatly assist in determining the employee independent contractor issue  She said that at most  it might indicate what one of the parties might have thought the relationship was  and that in this case that was not a matter of significant weight
