SZMJA v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedAntoun v R   HCA       ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The reasons for decision as provided by the Federal Magistrates Court set forth  in summary form  the evidence as was before the Tribunal and then proceeded to deal with both of the   Grounds   being advanced for consideration  The Federal Magistrate did not perceive there to be any jurisdictional error  He dismissed the contention that there had been a denial of procedural fairness by concluding      As for the second ground this appears to be a figment of the imagination of the person who wrote the application for this applicant  She actually attended two hearings   Exasperation may be felt when  as frequently happens in migration cases  arguments are advanced for resolution which appear to have little  if any  correlation with the facts in issue  Albeit in the context of addressing comments made by a trial judge during the course of a hearing  the following comments of Gleeson CJ in Antoun v R   HCA       ALR   reflect both the reality that may be experienced in entertaining what appear to be unmeritorious arguments and the need to always ensure the appearance of impartiality    Judges do not have to devote unlimited time to listening to unmeritorious arguments  Sometimes  a brief hearing will suffice  Judges may anticipate events at trial  and foresee lines of argument that may be developed  Here  the appellants made it clear from the outset that they hoped to be able to secure acquittal without giving evidence themselves  Perhaps the judge felt indignant about the conduct disclosed by the evidence  or about the tactics adopted by the appellants  Indignation is a natural reaction to some facts that are disclosed  or some events that occur  at a criminal trial or  for that matter  on an appeal  It should never be permitted to compromise the appearance of impartiality that is required of judges   In the context of the present appeal it may likewise be observed that moderation in the language with which reasons for decision are expressed may be more productive of adverse decisions being accepted as a balanced and impartial resolution of a dispute  especially disputes involving an unrepresented litigant   There is nothing  however  which indicates that the Federal Magistrate in the present proceeding did not consider and   fairly   and   reasonably   resolve the arguments being advanced  Not only did the Federal Magistrate resolve the arguments being advanced by the now Appellant  he also considered a further argument potentially available to her based upon s  R  of the Migration Act    Cth   This argument had properly been raised by those appearing for the Respondent Minister appliedKlinger v Nicholl   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Other than the language used by the Federal Magistrate in his reasons for decision  there is thus no basis upon which any argument as to a lack of   fairness   could be advanced in the present appeal  That language  although it may have been more prudent for the observations to have been differently expressed  falls far short of establishing any reasonably held belief that the Federal Magistrate was not determining the case before him   fairly   and   reasonably    There is no basis upon which it could be contended that the Federal Magistrate was not acting   impartially and without prejudice    Each case must obviously be decided upon its own facts  But it may be noted that in Penhall Jones v New South Wales   FCA   a Federal Magistrate was not disqualified by reason of characterising an allegation that an offer had been made as a   bribe   as   ridiculous    That and other   strong   language  Buchanan J concluded  did not demonstrate on the part of the Federal Magistrate   a lack of preparedness to deal with  the case  in a balanced way   at    The manner in which a judgment is expressed may evidence a reasonable apprehension of bias  Vakuata v Kelly   HCA         CLR   at    But the use of intemperate language  of itself  does

cases cth HCA  html  There are at least two reasons why the first Ground of Appeal raised in this Court should be rejected  First  it was not an argument raised before the Federal Magistrates Court and no reason has been advanced as to why leave should now be granted to entertain the argument  Second  it is well accepted that a   reasonable apprehension   of bias must be   firmly established   Re JRL  Ex parte CJL   HCA         CLR    Mason J there observed  at   It seems that the acceptance by this Court of the test of reasonable apprehension of bias in such cases as Watson   HCA         CLR   and Livesey   HCA         CLR   has led to an increase in the frequency of applications by litigants that judicial officers should disqualify themselves from sitting in particular cases on account of their participation in other proceedings involving one of the litigants or on account of conduct during the litigation  It needs to be said loudly and clearly that the ground of disqualification is a reasonable apprehension that the judicial officer will not decide the case impartially or without prejudice  rather than that he will decide the case adversely to one party  There may be many situations in which previous decisions of a judicial officer on issues of fact and law may generate an expectation that he is likely to decide issues in a particular case adversely to one of the parties  But this does not mean either that he will approach the issues in that case otherwise than with an impartial and unprejudiced mind in the sense in which that expression is used in the authorities or that his previous decisions provide an acceptable basis for inferring that there is a reasonable apprehension that he will approach the issues in this way  In cases of this kind  disqualification is only made out by showing that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias by reason of prejudgment and this must be  firmly established  Reg v Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission  Ex parte Angliss Group   HCA         CLR   at     Watson     CLR at   Re Lusink  Ex parte Shaw     ALR   at      Although it is important that justice must be seen to be done

disqualification of a judge  they will have their case tried by someone thought to be more likely to decide the case in their favour   There is no basis upon which any   reasonable apprehension   of bias on the part of the Tribunal could be established  A review of the reasons for decision of the Tribunal does not establish anything other than the Tribunal reviewing the facts before it and the

practised in Australia since she has been here which is now nearly nine months since her arrival date    An application was then filed with the Federal Magistrates Court for review by that Court  The application was dismissed and reasons for decision published on   September   SZMJA v Minister for Immigration   FMCA     The Appellant now appeals to this Court  She appeared before the Court

application     I clarify all my points at the hearing of the Federal Magistrates Court  but the Judge didn t consider my application fairly  The Judge dismissed my application     I believe that my application was not considered reasonably by the Judge at the Federal Magistrates Court   An Affidavit filed in this Court simply states  My application for a protection visa was refused by DIAC and
