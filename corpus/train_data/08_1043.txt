cth FCA  html  One consideration relevant to an application for an extension of time is whether an explanation has been provided as to why an appeal was not filed within time  Although it is to be expected that an acceptable explanation will normally be given  there is no rule that such an explanation is an essential precondition to the granting of an extension of time  Comcare v A Hearn   FCA         FCR   at   per Black CJ  Gray and Burchett JJ  In the present proceeding the Applicant explained to this Court that he was provided with a copy of the decision of the Tribunal in late January   and thereafter he was given the   run around   when he attempted to get the   paperwork   necessary to be completed for the purposes of an appeal  Of some concern is the apparent difficulty that the Applicant experienced when seeking to obtain advice in respect to the Tribunal s decision and his difficulty in obtaining access to a draft notice of appeal    In such circumstances  the mere expiration of time as between being notified of the Tribunal decision and the filing of the Application in April   would not of itself have precluded an extension being granted  On his account  the Applicant attempted to pursue his right of appeal but was not provided with the necessary advice or information so as to enable an appeal to be filed  No prejudice was claimed by the Respondent should an extension be granted consideredDunning v Secretary  Department of Family   Community Services   FCA       ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Section   thus provides that the

   FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  At least two factors militated against dismissing the proceeding on   June    First  the failure of the unrepresented Applicant to appear was only the second occasion that the matter had been before the Court  No Notice of Motion had been filed seeking such an order  although the Respondent Secretary had apparently caused a letter to be forwarded to the Applicant foreshadowing that the dismissal of the proceeding may be sought  Second  given the Applicant s request to appear by telephone hookup  it would have been a manifestly harsh exercise of discretion to summarily terminate his proceeding at such an early stage in circumstances where it was apparent that he did wish to be heard    even if only by way of telephone  There was certainly no   history of non compliance   Lenijamar Pty Ltd v AGC  Advances  Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     On   June   the proceeding was stood over for hearing to today  Prior to that date the Registry of this Court notified the Applicant of the orders made on   June   including giving notification that the hearing was to take place at    am on   July    The Applicant appeared in person today and gave an unsworn account as to the facts leading up to the filing of his Application in April    The solicitor appearing for the Respondent Secretary was content for his factual account to be given in that informal manner   Today a further application was made on behalf of the Secretary to again amend the name of the Respondent  The name as provided on   June   was incorrect and the correct name is   Secretary  Department of Families  Community Services and Indigenous Affairs    An order further amending the name of the Respondent should be made  The Applicant did not oppose that

any event  and as submitted on behalf of the Respondent Secretary  the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was a decision affirming a decision refusing such a payment  The jurisdiction of
