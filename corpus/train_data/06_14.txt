matter is  ripe  for separate and preliminary determination where it is a central issue in contention between the parties  the resolution of which will either obviate the necessity of litigation altogether or substantially narrow the field of controversy  referred toNovartis Crop Protection Australasia Pty Ltd v Orica Australia Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In Novartis Crop Protection Australasia Pty Ltd v Orica Australia Pty Ltd   FCA     Stone J said at      In particular circumstances the separate decision of a question may be appropriate even if it will not bring the proceedings to an end  Examples are where there is a strong prospect that once the core of their dispute is decided  the parties will settle the remaining issues or where the decision will obviate an unnecessary and expensive hearing of other questions  Such situations must  however  be carefully controlled lest fragmentation of the proceedings should bring delay  expense and hardship  which the making of the order was intended to avoid   Diageo submits that the order sought should be made for the following reasons     a  It is clear that the issues in the main proceeding will require voluminous discovery and extensive evidence     b  There is nothing at this stage which indicates that there will be any commonality of evidence or witnesses  other than in relation to the issues of ownership of the Cross Claim Trade Marks  that would make it convenient to hear both the Cross Claim and the Amended Statement of Claim together  Diageo submits that the determining of the Cross Claim prior to the Amended Statement of Claim may in fact avoid the costs and inconvenience of a hearing on the Amended Statement of Claim  if the Cross Claim is determined in the cross claimants  favour  Diageo is unlikely to recover all of its costs in this case and will have expended a considerable amount of time as well as money    c  There is no prejudice to the cross claimants if the orders are made and it may assist the cross claimants in having their claims heard earlier     d  There does not appear to be any prejudice to SPI Spirits and Spirits International other than a delay in payment of any damages that might be awarded  a prejudice that will be compensated by payment of interest  The Distribution Agreement has come to an end  Diageo is no longer distributing Diageo Stolichnaya Vodka  and SPI Spirits has entered into an agreement with another company for the distribution of its vodka in Australia     e  The determination of such a decisive issue is likely to be a major factor to both SPI Spirits and Diageo in considering settlement    f  As stated above  the main proceeding has not progressed at all beyond a defence and reply and is now back to the beginning with the proposed filing of an Amended Application and Amended Statement of Claim which significantly alter the overall case against Diageo  The conduct which is the subject of the main proceeding has either concluded or  in the case of the Ruski Claims  commenced in April   and no interlocutory injunction has been sought     g  Resolution of the issue of ownership of the marks is likely to contribute to settlement   Finally  Diageo submits that there is an important issue of case management to be considered  not merely in relation to the inconvenience to Diageo if all claims in the proceeding are heard together  There is also the convenience of the Court  Not only might hearing time be reduced  both for the trial and any interlocutory disputes  but there would be considerable benefits for the trial judge  If all claims are heard together  the trial judge  in writing his or her judgment  may consider it necessary to determine the ownership issue first  If the ownership issue is determined in favour of the cross claimants  the trial judge is likely to feel obliged to determine all the remaining issues on the Amended Statement of Claim  If the issue of ownership of the Cross Claim Trade Marks is fundamental to the Amended Statement of Claim  then both the Court s and the parties  resources may have been unnecessarily wasted   In order to minimise any prejudice to SPI Spirits and Spirits International  Diageo offered to make the following undertakings if the orders are made     a  Not to destroy any documents relevant to the issues raised by the Amended Statement of Claim  yet to be filed   b  to maintain comprehensive sales records relating to Ruski   c  to agree to be bound by the final determination of the Court of the Amended Cross Claim   SPI Spirits and Spirits International submitted that determination of the Cross Claim will not  for the reasons outlined above  likely dispose of or substantially narrow the issues arising in the Amended Statement of Claim  Even if the Cross Claim is determined adversely to Spirits International  SPI Spirits and Spirits International will be entitled to pursue their claims against Diageo
