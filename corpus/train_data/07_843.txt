University of Western Australia v Gray  No     FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedVictoria University of Technology v Wilson     IPR   The tender was supported by Sirtex Medical Limited  Sirtex  which referred to observations made by Nettle J in Victoria University of Technology v Wilson     IPR   that  at           a fiduciary s position only inhibits him or her in respect of business opportunities that the principal is actively pursuing or in which the principal might reasonably be expected to be interested  As Professor Glover put it in the first edition of his work on commercial equity   characterisation of an opportunity as a fiduciary opportunity overlaps with the characterisation of whether the scope of fiduciary duties extends to the opportunity in question    Objection was taken to the tender by the University on the basis that Dr Gray was seeking to put in evidence of a tendency on the part of the University to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind in relation to the commercialisation of inventions  This was evidence which  it was said  was covered by s   of the Evidence Act    Cth   Evidence covered by that section which defines  the tendency rule  is admissible only upon prior reasonable notice in writing to the other parties  Moreover it is not admissible if the Court considers that it would not  either by itself or having regard to other evidence  have significant probative value  The notice requirement can be waived by the Court under s    Also relevant for present purposes are the provisions of s   of the Evidence Act which provide      The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might       a  be unfairly prejudicial to a party  or      b  be misleading or confusing  or      c  cause or result in undue waste of time   I have perused the documents contained in the two folders  They relate to the resolution of a particular dispute about the ownership of intellectual property and do not appear on the face of them to support general inferences about the tendency or capacity of the University at the relevant time in relation to the commercialisation of intellectual property  They potentially open up a wide field of inquiry about the basis upon which the settlement reached in the case to which they relate turned upon an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the University s case or more general considerations  To the extent that the documents go to tendency in the sense covered by s     I do not consider that they have significant probative value in the present case  To the extent that they are said to go to capacity  I consider that their probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that they might cause or result in undue waste of time   The tender of the documents will be refused      I certify that the preceding nine   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French    Associate Dated    May   Counsel for the Applicant  Mr T Tobin QC  Mr M Green and Mr D Pratt     Solicitor for the Applicant  Jackson McDonald     Counsel for the First Respondent  Mr M Bennett and Mr I Freeman     Solicitor for the First Respondent  Lavan Legal  Counsel for the Second Respondent Solicitor for the Second Respondent   Mr JD Elliott SC  Mr EJC Heerey and Mr J Emmett DLA Phillips Fox Date of Hearing    May       Date of Judgment    May         AustLII  Copyright Policy   Disclaimers   Privacy Policy   Feedback   URL  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html
