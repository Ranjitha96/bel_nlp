Caltex Australia Petroleum Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedCommissioner of Taxation v Jax Tyres Pty Ltd     FCR   Caltex contended that the residual oils were neither  manufactured  nor  produced  according to the ordinary meaning of those words  In reliance on Commissioner of Taxation v Jax Tyres Pty Ltd     FCR     Jax Tyres   Caltex said that the essence of manufacturing or producing is that what is made shall be a new and different article having a distinctive character or use from that out of which it is made  The residual oils are not made from crude oil  it said  but are an undesirable material left over at the completion of a process designed to manufacture other products  for example  petrol  diesel and jet fuel   Caltex focussed on the objectives of its refinery operations  It said that far from those operations being directed to making the residual oils  their existence was neither intended nor desired and Caltex at all times sought to minimise their creation  Rather than being manufactured goods  it said  the residual oils are an inevitable consequence of making the goods that Caltex intended for sale   At the core of Caltex s argument was a characterisation of the residual oils as a type of  waste  produced as part of a manufacturing process but requiring  disposal  in some manner  Disposal by burning as a refinery fuel it said was analogous to scrap wood being burnt by a carpenter to heat his or her factory   The Macquarie Dictionary meanings of  manufacture  include   T o make or produce by hand or machinery  especially on a large scale  to make in any manner  to work up  material  into form for use      In the context of the sales tax legislation  Lockhart J said in Jax Tyres  at   The primary meaning of the word  manufacture  when used as a verb is to make something by hand  but since the industrial revolution the word has come to mean manufacture by machinery  often on a large scale and with a division of labour  This accords with the dictionary definition          To manufacture an article necessarily involves producing a different article from the articles  materials or ingredients from which it was made  As Darling J said in McNicol v Pinch     KB   at        I think the essence of making or of manufacturing is that what is made shall be a different thing from that out of which it is made      That passage was approved and applied by Dixon J in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Jack Zinader Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   the leading case in this field  Whether the article which results from the process of manufacturing is a different article from the constituents or ingredients from which it was made is a question of fact  the Jack Zinader case   Production      is a word of wide import  but it still involves the element of producing something different from the materials from which it was made  It is not possible to formulate precise definitions of such general terms as  manufacture  and  production  but they do not bear a restricted meaning  Whatever answers the description of  manufacture  or  production  of goods according to accepted usage of the English language is within the Act   The courts have attributed an ordinary meaning  within the  accepted usage of the English language  to the terms  manufactured   manufacture  and  manufactured goods  in a number of cases  see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Rochester   HCA         CLR   at    Dixon J  MP Metals Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    Menzies J  Jax Tyres at   Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Jack Zinander Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at      Dixon J  Commonwealth v   Star Foods Pty Ltd     FLR    In   Star Foods   Byrne J said at   The cases to which I was referred also emphasise that the word  manufacture  should be given its meaning in ordinary everyday language  Cooper Brookes  Wollongong  Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation  Cth    HCA         CLR   at     per Gibbs CJ  To my mind this meaning comprehends the application of a repetitive process  especially a mechanical process  to a thing or things to bring it or them to a form or condition specified  This process may be directed to producing a thing in a state fit for sale  for consumption by the end user  for attachment to or assembly with other things or for some further process       Caltex laid emphasis on the fact that none of the residual oils is an intended object of the activities it undertakes at the refineries  Accordingly it said that to characterise the residual oils as manufactured or produced goods would lead to the strange result that Caltex was unintentionally manufacturing something  However for the purposes of s   of the Tariff Act  the critical question in my view is whether objectively speaking the goods in question can be said to have emerged from a process as a  new and different article     having a distinctive character or use  see Jax Tyres   FCR at    Lockhart J   The focus of s   is on the extant goods that are made subject to duty  not on the person who manufactures them or that person s stated objectives  Duty is imposed  on  goods by reference to their quality as manufactured goods  It is not imposed with any reference to the relative value of the goods or the subjective intentions of the manufacturer  This is not to say that the principle objectives of a commercial operation will not be relevant to the question of characterisation  They provide the context for the task of characterisation and are an important factor to take into account  They are not however determinative of the question  In any event I do not think it is accurate to say that Caltex unintentionally manufactures the residual oils  They are not the principal products created at the refineries  but it is clear that Caltex intends to bring about all of the known consequences of the refining process  which includes the production of the residual oils  In doing so its objective is to extract as much value as possible from the crude oil  I do not accept Caltex s pejorative characterisation of the residual oils as waste or rubbish  It did not dispose of them as if they were waste  it consumed them in a productive manner   Caltex made a further submission that the residual oils were not  produced  for the purposes of s   because the word  produced  is there concerned only with tobacco production  The Excise Act draws a distinction it said between goods manufactured and goods produced  because the Act has distinct licensing arrangements for  licensed manufacturers  and  licensed producers  the latter of which are held only by producers of tobacco  see Division   of Part III of the Excise Act   Caltex said that  produced  should be construed with that context in mind and limited to the production of the various tobacco products identified in the Schedule   I cannot accept that the word  production  must be limited in that way  The contention that it should was not developed by Caltex in any detail  It amounted to not much more than an assertion that a narrow construction was required because of the existence of the specific licensing arrangements for tobacco  producers  in Division   of Part III  Division   regulates the production of tobacco seed  tobacco plant and tobacco leaf by requiring a producer to hold a  producer licence   A  producer licence  is  a licence granted under Part IV   the holding of which authorises the licence holder to produce tobacco seed  tobacco plant or tobacco leaf   There is nothing express in Division   of Part III of the Excise Act that could be said to limit the ambit of the word  produced  in the Tariff Act  Further  s   of the Tariff Act gives no indication that  produced  is intended to be limited to tobacco production  To the contrary s   is in wide terms and applies to   all goods     manufactured or produced   The Schedule itself reflects the intended width of the term  It describes various goods as  products  including those in issue in this case and refers to some goods  other than tobacco  as having been manufactured or produced  see  for example  item  a  describing  diesel fuel produced or manufactured by the process of refining waste oils       The word  produced  is not defined in the Tariff Act  which one would expect if it were to be given the restricted meaning Caltex contends for  In my view it should be given its ordinary meaning   Neither party referred me to the legislative history of Division   of Part III or s   of the Tariff Act  I note however that the words  manufactured or produced  have appeared in s   of the Tariff Act since its inception in    and the section itself has remained in the same form since then   At that time no equivalent to Division   of Part III appeared in the Excise Act   Division   of Part III was introduced in the relevant form in   and I see no reason why its introduction at that time should alter the ordinary meaning of  produced  in s   of the Tariff Act  Further  it may be observed that the version of the Excise Act in force in   contained specific provisions relating to the  manufacture  of tobacco and included separate licensing arrangements for  producers  of  material    Material  included  all material used in the manufacture of excisable goods and declared by proclamation to be material within the meaning of this Act   There could be no suggestion that the word  produced  in s   of the Tariff Act was to have borne a restricted meaning relevant only to  material  because  produced  in s   quite clearly related to  goods dutiable under the Schedule   excisable goods  and not the more limited concept of  material  or  for that matter  tobacco   Caltex made a number of submissions regarding the constitutional conception of duties of excise  which it said bore importantly on the proper construction of the words  manufactured  or  produced   It submitted that the  essence  of a duty of excise is that it is a tax on a step in the production or distribution of goods that are intended to be passed on by a manufacturer to consumers   that is  third party consumers  Consistently with that understanding  it said  the Tariff Act imposes duties of excise directly on or in respect of goods that are destined for consumption by consumers  the relevant excise step being the step of manufacturing or producing the goods before they are passed down the line to consumers  Accordingly it said the terms  manufactured  and  produced  should be construed as applying only to the step of manufacture or production taken with respect to goods intended to reach third party consumers  i e  not goods that are consumed by their manufacturer   On that basis Caltex said it does not  manufacture  or  produce  the residual oils because it takes no step to bring them into existence as part of a process that ends in their receipt by third party consumers  Instead they are created because they are an inevitable consequence of the process of producing other goods which are intended to reach consumers

Matthews demonstrates that a tax imposed on any one of the steps referred to will qualify as a duty of excise  For example a tax imposed on the sale of goods to consumers would be an excise  as would a tax imposed on the manufacture of goods without any necessary reference to their sale  In support of its contention Caltex relied particularly upon passages in Anderson s Pty Ltd v Victoria   HCA         CLR     Anderson s  and Bolton v Madsen   HCA         CLR     Bolton   which were followed by the Full Court of this Court in Commissioner for A C T  Revenue v Kithock Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR     Kithock     In Anderson s   Barwick CJ said at    T he judicial formulation of the nature of a duty of excise within the meaning of the Constitution has progressed over the intervening years  It has now  however  in my opinion  received definitive exposition by this Court  and  however much other views might have been possible at an earlier stage  it ought now to be taken as settled that the essence of a duty of excise is that it is a tax upon the taking of a step in a process of bringing goods into existence or to a consumable state  or of passing them down the line which reaches from the earliest stage in production to the point of receipt by the consumer   Emphasis added   Assuming they fall within the Schedule  the impost in this case is levied directly on the residual oils as the  subjects of manufacture  and affects them as commodities in the hands of Caltex  The residual oils are of use to Caltex and serve an economic purpose  Without them Caltex would need to acquire fuel oil from an alternative source at higher cost  The impost is not levied upon the consumption of the residual oils by Caltex  Nor is it a tax on the ownership of the residual oils  It is an excise in the most obvious sense  a tax upon the step of manufacturing or producing a defined good  In my view  to accept the limitation contended for by Caltex would be counter to the trend of the High Court s decision making from the early decision in Peterswald v Bartley   HCA         CLR   through to Ha   HCA       CLR     which has been to enlarge the field of permissible steps of taxation in the context of duties of excise   Further  Caltex s argument arrives at a position whereby excise duties would be limited to taxes bearing the characteristics of an indirect tax a tax levied on a person with the expectation that that person will not bear the financial burden of the tax but pass it on to another  The indirectness or otherwise of a tax has been rejected as a necessary element of an excise  see Dennis Hotels Pty Ltd v Victoria   HCA         CLR     Dennis Hotels   at     and    Menzies J  see also Ha   CLR at    The effect of adopting Caltex s position would be to reject the step of manufacture or production as an occasion in itself for the imposition of an excise and necessitate an inquiry into the subjective intentions of the relevant manufacturer  As I have said the cases demonstrate the stand alone nature of each permissible taxation step and it would not be consistent in my view to introduce a limitation focussed on intention  In this connection  I adopt what Menzies J said in Dennis Hotels   CLR at   I find nothing in the language of the Constitution which would exclude from the categories of duties of customs or duties of excise  duties to be borne as well as paid by the importer or manufacturer  In other words  unless it be by the use of the words  customs  and  excise  themselves  the Constitution does not adopt the distinction between direct and indirect taxes so that  unless the usage of the words otherwise requires  an import duty on goods imported for use or consumption by the importer would be a customs duty  and a duty upon the production of goods for the producer s own use or consumption would be an excise duty  and both would be beyond the power of the Parliament of a State   In my view a thing capable of description as a manufactured good  and consumed or otherwise applied by its manufacturer in that manufacturer s commercial operations  is capable of being the subject of an excise duty appliedMatthews v Chicory

excise duty  the steps of   bringing into existence    bringing to a consumable state or   passing them down the line to the point of receipt by the consumer  I agree  The passage is consistent with the understanding that an excise may be imposed on discrete steps taking place with respect to goods  without it being necessary that every step take place  The passage does not articulate a principle that excise duties are only those taxes that affect goods destined for consumption by parties other than the original manufacturer or producer  Similarly the emphasis placed by the Full Court in Kithock on the position of consumers was necessary to explain  by way of exclusion  that goods already in circulation amongst consumers cannot be the subject of an excise duty  It is by now clear that consumption taxes are not excises  While it is an essential characteristic of an excise that goods have not yet passed into consumption  I do not accept that it is essential that goods are intended to pass into a market or to be sold to a third party  even though that will be the ordinary occurrence distinguishedBolton v Madsen   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The

their production or distribution before they reach the hands of consumers     Emphasis added      This formulation does not refer to the  ultimate  or  final  or  intermediate  consumer  but is expressed by reference to the plurality of consumers and therefore is a reference to the first consumer  In our opinion  this formulation is the authoritative test which this Court is bound to apply

duties are only those taxes that affect goods destined for consumption by parties other than the original manufacturer or producer  Similarly the emphasis placed by the Full Court in Kithock on the position of consumers was necessary to explain  by way of exclusion  that goods already in circulation amongst consumers cannot be the subject of an excise duty  It is by now clear that consumption taxes are not excises  While it is an essential characteristic of an excise that goods have not yet passed into consumption  I do not accept that it is essential that goods are intended to pass into a market or to be sold to a third party  even though that will be the ordinary occurrence   I agree with the Commissioner that Caltex delivered the residual oils for home consumption for the purposes of the Excise Act   The Excise Act does not refer to delivery to a person but adopts the more ample language of delivery for or into home consumption  While I accept that the typical case of delivery will involve the movement of excisable goods from one person or place to another  the language of the Excise Act is sufficiently broad in my view to apply to the less typical case of consumption by a manufacturer at its own premises  The contention that the Excise Act necessarily requires the physical removal of goods from one place to another seems to me to give the concept of delivery for home consumption a restricted meaning not warranted either by the breadth of the language used or the evident purpose of the legislation  namely to tax manufactured goods consumed in Australia  In my view the use of the words  for  and  into  demonstrates a focus by the Excise Act on the status of excisable goods  that is  their readiness for consumption  rather than whether they have necessarily been transferred between people or places appliedDennis Hotels Pty Ltd v Victoria   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Further  Caltex s argument arrives at a position whereby excise duties would be limited to taxes bearing the characteristics of an indirect tax a tax levied on a person with the expectation that that person will not bear the financial burden of the tax but pass it on to another  The indirectness or otherwise of a tax has been rejected as a necessary element of an excise  see Dennis Hotels Pty Ltd v Victoria   HCA         CLR     Dennis Hotels   at     and    Menzies J  see also Ha   CLR at    The effect of adopting Caltex s position would be to reject the step of manufacture or production as an occasion in itself for the imposition of an excise and necessitate an inquiry into the subjective intentions of the relevant manufacturer  As I have said the cases demonstrate the stand alone nature of each permissible taxation step and it would not be consistent in my view to introduce a limitation focussed on intention  In this connection  I adopt what Menzies J said in Dennis Hotels   CLR at   I find nothing in the language of the Constitution which would exclude from the categories of duties of customs or duties of excise  duties to be borne as well as paid by the importer or manufacturer  In other words  unless it be by the use of the words  customs  and  excise  themselves  the Constitution does not adopt the distinction between direct and indirect taxes so that  unless the usage of the words otherwise requires  an import duty on goods imported for use or consumption by the importer would be a customs duty  and a duty upon the production of goods for the producer s own use or consumption would be an excise duty  and both would be beyond the power of the Parliament of a State   In my view a thing capable of description as a manufactured good  and consumed or otherwise applied by its manufacturer in that manufacturer s commercial operations  is capable of being the subject of an excise duty citedK   S Lake City Freighters Pty Ltd v Gordon   Gotch Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The words must of course be construed in context and by reference to the policies and objectives of the Tariff Act as a whole  K   S Lake City Freighters Pty Ltd v Gordon   Gotch Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    Mason J  s  AA Acts Interpretation Act    Cth   The context here requires a consideration of the processes involved in petroleum production and the effect those processes have on their subject matter crude oil  I do not see any reason however why the ordinary meaning of  refined   freed from impurities   purified   made purer or of finer quality  should not be given to that word as it appears in the Schedule  This is especially so where the refining of petroleum is provided as an example of the ordinary dictionary meaning  see   above    When that is done  it follows in my view that none of the residual oils can be said to be  refined  or  semi refined  for the following reasons  Firstly  they are not themselves freed from impurities or extraneous matter  nor are they purified or clarified  They have not been in any sense made purer or of finer quality  I do not agree that Caltex s other products should be put to one side when characterising the residual oils  A comparison is useful because those other products  kerosene  jet fuel  diesel fuel  are freed from impurities  in that the heavier  less desirable hydrocarbons and the naturally occurring contaminants in the crude oil are separated from the lighter hydrocarbons that make up those products  Those lighter streams are then treated so as to further reduce the level of contaminants and convert them into saleable products  Whereas those products are made purer or of finer quality  the residual oils are essentially the original impurities themselves   Secondly  while it may be correct to say  as the Commissioner suggests  that the residual oils are not impure when considered as discrete goods  this does not mean that they are or have been purified or made finer in quality  The mere fact that they have been produced in a refinery is not sufficient in my view to give them the quality of a  refined  product  Similarly  I do not consider the fact that they have a commercial use makes them a  refined  product  Commercial value or use does not seem to me particularly relevant to whether something should be properly described as  refined  consideredAttorney General v The Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd     VLR   In Attorney General v The Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd     VLR     Madden CJ considered the construction of the term  molasses refined  in Victoria s pre Federation customs and excise duties legislation  At   his Honour said  The evidence shows that the process which  molasses  undergoes at the defendant company s works practically amounts to a straining  by which foreign matters  debris  and rubbish are extracted  and nothing more  It also appears that when sugar is refined this is a preliminary part of the process it passes through  but that in the case of sugar when this is done the sugar is treated with phosphoric acid in order to eliminate certain matters  and the acid is then eliminated by the use of alum  Subsequently the sugar is submitted to other treatment  which is specifically termed in trade  refining  viz   passing it over charcoal beds  so as to eliminate from it substances naturally in it  that is intrinsic as distinguished from extrinsic impurities  and when this is done the sugar is said to be  refined   This passing over charcoal is the test which constitutes refinement as distinguished from straining and other processes   Emphasis added    Later  at     his Honour said  The International Dictionary  which Webster revised  gives  refined  as  freed from impurities or alloy  purified  polished  cultured  delicate  as refined gold  refined language  refined sentiment   Nobody speaks of the refinement of the gold when only separating the quartz and other like substances in which it is found  but which form no inherent part of it  from the metal  One only refines when one comes to retort the gold and the inherent alloys  silver  copper  etc   are extracted from it  Therefore we may take from the meaning in the dictionary that the refining of sugar or molasses stands in the same category as refining of gold  of silver  or of wine  I think that refinement must mean here as sugar is refined  and that the word  refined  would not be properly applied to a mere straining or filtering   Accordingly his Honour held that the molasses  which similarly to the residual oils here was produced as a consequence of the refining of a raw sugar  could not be characterised as  refined  as a result of it being strained to remove extrinsic impurities  frogs  brickbats and nails  that had found their way in during storage  As is evident from his Honour s decision  some form of purification in the sense of removing intrinsic impurities was central to the concept of refinement or  refined  as it was held to have been used in the relevant Victorian legislation  Contrary to the Commissioner s submission  I do not consider that the process of separating the crude oil into different components in and of itself means that each separated component therefore has the character of a  refined  product  This is especially so where the component in question is essentially removed from the whole because of its inferior or impure nature   It follows from what I have said that none of the residual oils fall within item  a  of the Schedule and are consequently not dutiable  However  in case I am wrong on this point  I intend to deal with all remaining issues  which were fully argued  This includes whether the Lytton Refinery Fuel Oil is a  liquid  petroleum product   It was common ground that both the Kurnell Residual Slop Oil and CLOR Residual Slop Oil are properly described as liquids and thus would fall within item  a  if they are  refined  or  semi refined  products  Caltex contended however that the Lytton Refinery Fuel Oil was not a liquid  for the reasons set out at    It said that the  standard  reference point for determining whether something was a liquid was a temperature of  deg C and pressure of    kPa  As I have found at   and   the Lytton Refinery Fuel Oil is a solid at those standard temperature and pressure conditions but a liquid when it is produced  stored and then consumed as a burner fuel   I do not accept Caltex s submission  Neither the Schedule to the Tariff Act nor the Tariff Act itself contains any stipulation that the relevant  refined or semi refined  petroleum products in item  a  must be liquid at standard temperature or pressure   By contrast  the Tariff Act does in respect of other goods prescribe certain physical properties by reference to specific temperatures and pressures  For example  s   prescribes the physical characteristics of  fuel oil  which include a density and a minimum kinematic viscosity measured at  deg C and  deg C respectively  Moreover  the prescription of a standard temperature and pressure for the determination of a liquid state is used elsewhere in the Excise Act    Condensate  for example  is defined in s   of the Excise Act as either   a  liquid petroleum  or  b  a substance       i  that is derived from gas associated with oil production  and   ii  that is liquid at standard temperature and pressure      Emphasis added  citedRheem Australia Ltd v Collector of Customs  NSW      ALR   I agree with the Commissioner s construction of par  d   Item  I  is divided into three paragraphs of increasing generality  The word  other  is used in a number of places see  I b   I   other  in packages not exceeding   litres   I   Other  and  I d   On an ordinary reading of item  I  it seems to me that the word  other  as it is used in each case is intended to describe goods that come within the general item description  other refined or partly refined petroleum products      other than those that fall within any of the preceding  more specific  paragraphs  In other words  products that do not come within item  I   recycled petroleum products not elsewhere specified  or  I   Other  in packages not exceeding   litres  would therefore fall to item  I   Other   Similarly  par  d  of item  I  seems plainly to apply to any product within item  I  that is not covered by pars  a   b  or  c   A similar construction of the word  other  as it appears in the Customs Tariff Act    Cth  was adopted in Rheem Australia Ltd v Collector of Customs  NSW      ALR   at    Burchett J   On that construction  item  I d  applies to any  refined or partly refined petroleum product  that    is not covered by either of the preceding paragraphs   I  or  I    is not for use in an internal combustion engine  and    does not contain the required chemical marker    Assuming they are  refined  products  the description just given is applicable to each of the residual oils   Without more  it is difficult to read par  d  in the manner contended for by Caltex  Beyond reference to the extrinsic material  no explanation was offered as to why Parliament would not have clearly identified in the drafting that par  d  was to be limited to non fuel uses  If  other  means anything  it means other than  a   b  or  c   Between them   a   b  and  c  cover all possible uses  Putting to one side combustion engine fuel  dealt with by  a  the only remaining discriminant between  b  and  c  on the one hand and  d  on the other is the inclusion of the marker  In my view this accords with precisely what Parliament had in mind when it introduced par  d   It appears from the passages in the extrinsic material quoted above that the marker was to be the  cornerstone  of the regime introduced in    It was given a critical function  in that concessional status  or  free  status for non fuels  would only apply to products if they contained the marker  This is made clear from the discussion of the proposed item  I  in the explanatory memorandum to the   Bill  At page   the explanatory memorandum states  The new subitems of item   generally have a three tiered excise tariff rate based on the intended use of the products  Products for use otherwise than as fuels and containing the prescribed proportion of marker are dutiable at the rate of  Free   Products for use as a fuel otherwise than in an internal combustion  engine  and containing the prescribed proportion of marker are dutiable at a concessional rate  Products containing no marker and  generally  which are for use in an internal combustion engine are dutiable at the highest rates   Further  the   Act did not include item  I d  but item  I  was as follows    Recycled petroleum products      a  Diesel fuel  and gasoline  on which customs or excise duty has been paid  recovered by a recycling process not being a process of refining Free    b  other      i  containing at least the prescribed proportion of the marker for use otherwise than as a fuel in an internal combustion engine Free    ii  other    L  Emphasis added  consideredR v Lyon   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Caltex submitted that the residual oils were at no time  delivered  for home consumption because the concept of delivery in the Excise Act signifies a transfer of actual or constructive possession from one person to another  In this case  it said  there was no such transfer because it used the residual oils itself at its own premises  Caltex relied on a passage from O Connor J s judgment in R v Lyon   HCA         CLR     Lyon   where his Honour in the context of the customs legislation dealt with the provision for customs control over goods  until delivery for home consumption or exportation   which provision is mirrored in s   of the Excise Act    His Honour stated at   The object of that provision  if it were necessary to give any reasons for its enactment  is obvious  if once goods go into home consumption  that is  into circulation  it becomes almost impossible to trace them   According to Caltex  goods such as the residual oils which never leave its premises cannot be said to  go     into circulation  and cannot therefore have been  delivered  for home consumption   The Commissioner s submissions can be summarised as follows   a  Upon their manufacture  Caltex did not sell or export the residual oils  It dedicated them for its own use as refinery fuel at the relevant premises  Its dedication of the oils for that use is plain on the evidence  which demonstrates that Caltex maintained and consumed the oils for that purpose    b  The expression  delivered for home consumption   ss   and  C  is broad and should not be read down as applying only to delivery of goods between individuals or between places  Nor should  home consumption  be limited by reference to the identity of the actual consumer  i e  whether the consumer is a third party or the manufacturer him or herself     c  The concept of delivery for home consumption is critical to s   because it determines the period of the Commissioner s control over excisable goods  In s   the concept exists to distinguish between two places for consumption Australia  home  or overseas  export   The use of the preposition  for  in the phrases  delivered for home consumption  and  delivered for exportation  demonstrate the section is concerned more broadly with the place of consumption rather than the transfer of possession between parties    d  The phrase  go into circulation  used by O Connor J in Lyon   HCA       CLR   was intended to explain the concept of home consumption not delivered for home consumption  That much is clear from the context in which his Honour used the phrase  being an explanation of the customs authorities  control over goods as a form of security until payment of the required duty  Here  Caltex s premises are in Australia and consumption of the residual oils within those premises is sufficient for the oils to  go into circulation     e  The residual oils were delivered for home consumption in a manner provided for by the Excise Act   They were delivered pursuant to Caltex s permissions under s  C and that delivery gave rise to a deemed entry for home consumption  see s  C   Accordingly  Caltex was required as a condition of its permission to include the residual oils in its weekly return and pay the corresponding duty   Another way of considering this is by reference to s    Section   renders all excisable goods  subject to  the Commissioner s  control until delivered for home consumption or for exportation to a place outside Australia  whichever occurs first   The control residing with the Commissioner is of broad scope and is critical for the protection of the Commonwealth s excise revenue  see Lyon   HCA       CLR   and Collector of Customs  New South Wales  v Southern Shipping Co Ltd   HCA         CLR     Southern Shipping    The section contemplates that excisable goods will be delivered for either home consumption or exportation  In my view the section evinces a legislative intention to cover the field in respect of all forms of internal  home  consumption and all exports  Historically  excise duties have been understood as running together with and supplementary to the customs duties traditionally imposed on certain goods  In Philip Morris Ltd v Commissioner of Business Franchises  Victoria    HCA         CLR   at   Mason CJ and Deane J approved the following passage from Quick and Garran s Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth   The fundamental conception of the term  excise  is that of a tax on articles produced or manufactured in a country  In the taxation of such articles of luxury  as spirits  beer  tobacco  and cigars  it has been the practice to place a certain duty on the importation of these articles and a corresponding or reduced duty on similar articles produced or manufactured in the country  and this is the sense in which excise duties have been understood in the Australian colonies  and in which the expression was intended to be used in the Constitution of the Commonwealth   Contrary to Caltex s submissions  I do not accept that the reference in Lyon   HCA       CLR   to goods going into circulation necessitates a more restricted construction of  delivered for home consumption   Justice O Connor s reference to going into circulation was used to explain how effective security over goods is lost once they have entered home consumption  His Honour was not there describing the concept of delivery nor  more importantly  intending to limit its scope  He was drawing attention to the policy of the customs legislation and the importance of the customs authorities  having a form of security over imported goods to ensure the payment of duty  I agree with the Commissioner that Caltex s dedication of the residual oils for consumption by it at its premises is sufficient  in the sense O Connor J had in mind  for the oils to  go into circulation    Similarly I reject Caltex s submission that the words  from a place  in s  C mean that excisable goods must be removed from that place before they can be considered  delivered  for home consumption  Again  while Caltex s construction accords with what will occur in the typical case  the section is not limited to that situation  The section also accommodates and is consistent with a delivery for home consumption constituted by a use of the relevant goods at that place  Furthermore  the reference to a place in s  C seems to me to be more concerned with the manner in which the Commissioner s control can be effectively exercised  Section  C follows ss      A and  B   each of which concern itself with the Commissioner s control and the granting of permissions  In the case of s  C   it seems to me that it is a necessary or at least convenient measure in permitting deliveries into home consumption without formal entries  that such activity is authorised only in respect of certain specified premises at which the Commissioner s control and supervision can be effectively exercised   For these reasons  I consider that Caltex delivered the residual oils for home consumption pursuant to its s  C permissions  Accordingly  if I am wrong on the  refined  point  then Caltex was obliged to account for the residual oils in its weekly returns and is liable to pay the requisite duty on them   In relation to  b  Caltex s submission has the effect that s   could only operate where excisable goods have not in fact been delivered for home consumption  The Commissioner submitted that s   applies whether or not goods have been delivered for home consumption  He emphasised that the purpose of the Commissioner s control over excisable goods is to ensure that duty is properly paid  relying on Lyon   HCA       CLR   and Southern Shipping   HCA       CLR   and the obligations imposed by s   are designed to ensure that the goods do not find their way into home consumption without proper payment  relying on Sidebottom   FCA       FCR    More particularly the Commissioner said that s   is aimed directly at the unauthorised relinquishment of possession  which would include delivering goods for home consumption in a manner that was not authorised  principally where there is no payment of duty followedMoama Refinery v Chief Executive Officer of Customs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  As an extension of this argument  Caltex said that s   which renders excisable goods subject to the Commissioner s control  until delivered for home consumption or exportation  demonstrates that  delivery  occurs only upon an entry pursuant to s   or a  deemed delivery  as it put it  pursuant to s  C  It referred to the fact that s   contains penalty provisions which prohibit interference with goods that are subject to control  and said that delivery for home consumption  which brings that control to an end  can only occur in a manner provided for by the Excise Act   Reliance was placed on Moama Refinery v Chief Executive Officer of Customs   FCA         FCR     Moama   where Ryan J referred to the regime in ss           and   and stated at   There can be no suggestion  on the facts of the present case  that the subject fuel had ever been  entered  for home consumption as contemplated by s  a  of the Act  Without such entry  or authorisation  they could not have been  delivered  for home consumption and  accordingly  by force of s   they remained subject to Customs control   As the final step in its argument  Caltex submitted that s  C  there here being no  entry  of the residual oils  makes it clear that excisable goods can only be delivered for home consumption upon being removed from the manufacturer s relevant premises  This was said to be because s  C permits a manufacturer to  deliver for home consumption from a place specified in the permission   emphasis added    In my view there was no doubt about the whereabouts of the residual oils or whether they had been  at least on the Commissioner s construction of s  a    kept safely  This is not a case where the location of the goods  and therefore whether they had gone into home consumption  was unknown  cf  Moama   FCA       FCR     or a case where the Commissioner only had  evidence which might lead him to form the opinion that excisable goods were not kept safely   see Sidebottom   FCA       FCR   at      The facts here were clear the residual oils had been consumed by Caltex at its premises without the payment of any duty   A similar situation arose in Moama   FCA       FCR    The Commissioner in that case issued a demand on the basis of s  b  only  but sought at the hearing  as an alternative  to validate the demand in reliance on s  a   After referring to Revlon Manufacturing Limited v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Wade   HCA         CLR     Ryan J found that the demand could be justified on the basis of s  a    even if s  b  had not been available  His Honour stated at   In my view  the amenability of Moama to the issue of a demand under s   did not depend on the exercise of any power by Customs  other than the issuing of the demand itself   It arose  as Wilcox J said in Revlon out of the operation of the Act itself  There was  accordingly  no scope for Moama to be under any misapprehension as to the basis upon which it was asked to pay duty on the subject fuel appliedCollector of Customs  New South Wales  v Southern Shipping Co Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Another way of considering this is by reference to s    Section   renders all excisable goods

articles produced or manufactured in the country  and this is the sense in which excise duties have been understood in the Australian colonies  and in which the expression was intended to be used in the Constitution of the Commonwealth   This however is to misconstrue the section and its intended operation  Liability under s   is  collateral and not substitutional  for the liability to pay excise duty that may be incurred under other provisions of the Excise Act   see Southern Shipping   CLR at    Dixon CJ  see also s   of the Excise Act   Section   is an alternative recovery mechanism open to the Commissioner in appropriate cases where the circumstances set out therein are met  Subject to what I say below  at     it was open to the Commissioner to rely on s   in making the request  regardless of whether he also maintained an alternative position that Caltex was liable for excise duty having delivered the residual oils for home consumption   While I was not taken to the parties  correspondence on this point in detail  I note that the Commissioner both prior to  in its Advice  and after making the request  in its objection decision  maintained a claim that Caltex had delivered the residual oils for home consumption for the purposes of s  C  In those circumstances  I do not consider that the request amounted to any form of concession that the Commissioner accepted that the residual oils had not been delivered  In any event  a proper construction of s   in my view would permit the Commissioner to rely on s   even where the relevant excisable goods have been  delivered for home consumption  where such delivery is not accompanied by the payment of duty  For reasons I shall explain below in dealing with the s   point  I consider that s   is capable of application to excisable goods that   have been subject to the Commissioner s control but   have not been kept safely by virtue of their delivery into home consumption without the payment of duty   I now turn to the Commissioner s alternative basis for Caltex s liability under the s   demand  The Commissioner relied on both ss  a  and  b  in the demand  The demand stated   Caltex  owes the Excise Collector of the Australian Taxation Office     the amount of     being the amount of the debt described in the Schedule   Caltex has sought to have the demand set aside for invalidity  on the following grounds   a  The residual oils are not  excisable goods  and s   has no application to them    b  Section   applies only to excisable goods that are  subject to the  Commissioner s  control   If as the Commissioner contended the residual oils were delivered for home consumption  then they were thereupon no longer subject to the Commissioner s control and s   does not apply    c  Caltex did not  fail to keep  the residual oils  safely   The safety with which s  a  is concerned is that the goods do not find their way into home consumption without the payment of duty  It is not directed at the protection of goods from damage or destruction  relying on Southern Shipping   CLR at    Taylor J  and    Menzies J   As the residual oils were  destroyed  by Caltex and did not and were never intended to find their way into home consumption  there was no failure to keep them safely for the purposes of s  a      d  The Commissioner was not entitled to make a request pursuant to s  b  nor to rely on that paragraph in the demand as a basis for liability  Section  b  may only be invoked when there is doubt about the whereabouts of goods or doubt as to whether they have been kept safely  relying on Sidebottom v Giuliano   FCA         FCR     Sidebottom    There was no doubt as to whether Caltex had failed to keep the residual oils safely  The Commissioner was aware that the residual oils had been burnt at Caltex s refineries  In particular  he acknowledged that the residual oils had been  used to generate energy within Caltex s refineries  in the purported request he made under s  b      e  Even if the Commissioner was entitled to make the s  b  request  Caltex properly accounted for the residual oils by explaining that they had been used to generate heat  which thereby demonstrated they had not gone into home consumption    f  The demand is invalid because it claimed payment of a  debt   Liability under s   only arises upon the due making of a valid demand  Accordingly Caltex could not have owed the amount demanded prior to the making of the demand and its description as a debt renders the demand invalid   In relation to  b  Caltex s submission has the effect that s   could only operate where excisable goods have not in fact been delivered for home consumption  The Commissioner submitted that s   applies whether or not goods have been delivered for home consumption  He emphasised that the purpose of the Commissioner s control over excisable goods is to ensure that duty is properly paid  relying on Lyon   HCA       CLR   and Southern Shipping   HCA       CLR   and the obligations imposed by s   are designed to ensure that the goods do not find their way into home consumption without proper payment  relying on Sidebottom   FCA       FCR    More particularly the Commissioner said that s   is aimed directly at the unauthorised relinquishment of possession  which would include delivering goods for home consumption in a manner that was not authorised  principally where there is no payment of duty   In relation to the failure to keep safely point at  c  the Commissioner relied on the decision of Finkelstein J in Sidebottom   FCA       FCR   and his Honour s discussion of the purposes of s   as explained by the High Court in Southern Shipping   HCA       CLR    What is clear from each of those cases is that s   imposes an essentially absolute duty to keep goods safely and to ensure they do not find their way into home consumption without the payment of duty  Where that does occur  the goods will have found their way into home consumption  irregularly  that is  in a manner not authorised by the Excise Act   and s   will apply in order that the revenue might be protected  The Commissioner said that the residual oils found their way into home consumption irregularly when Caltex consumed them without duty having been paid  I agree  As I said earlier  Caltex s consumption of the residual oils at its refineries amounted to  home consumption   It follows that Caltex s dedication of the residual oils as refinery fuel oil  without paying excise duty  and subsequent consumption of them by burning them  means that they found their way into home consumption irregularly  Caltex s consumption of the residual oils in this manner  by burning and thus using them up or  destroying  them  was therefore a failure to keep them safely within s  a   As Dixon CJ said in Southern Shipping   CLR at   the safe keeping comprehended by s  a  is the keeping safe from loss or destruction  because  the provision is pointed at the loss of goods involving the loss of excise duty   Caltex relied on the judgments of Taylor J  at   and Menzies J  at   in Southern Shipping   HCA       CLR   and their Honours  references to damage or destruction  However  their observations were directed not to a case such as the present  where the  destruction  is the consumption of the residual oils as a fuel  but to a rejection of the proposition that the section imposes a duty of care not to permit goods to be damaged or destroyed   I now turn to Caltex s submission at  d   The Commissioner acknowledged that it was entitled to request an account only where the safety of the relevant goods is something less than an  undoubted  fact  see Southern Shipping   CLR at    Owen J  Sidebottom   FCA       FCR   at    Finkelstein J   It said that the section was directed to an account that shows either        an unauthorised relinquishment of possession    despite an unauthorised loss of possession  that the goods have not gone into home consumption without payment of duty  or    despite a failure to keep them safely  the Commissioner s control over the goods is still effective  see Southern Shipping   CLR at    Menzies J  If I am wrong in that conclusion  I would reject Caltex s submission at  e  above that it had accounted for the residual oils  Its statement that residual oils were used as fuel in generating the required heat for the refineries was an accounting for their consumption  not an accounting  for the goods   It did not demonstrate that the residual oils had been dealt with in a manner authorised by the Excise Act or that  despite an unauthorised relinquishment of possession  the goods had not got into home consumption without duty being paid  or that despite a failure to keep them safely  the Commissioner s control was still effective over the residual oils  see Southern Shipping   CLR at    Menzies J   The purported account simply recited the facts  which showed that the residual oils had not been kept safely within the meaning of s  a   It was therefore reasonable for the Commissioner not to be satisfied that the goods had been accounted for   As I have found the Commissioner was not entitled to make a request under s  b    a question is raised as to the effect of this on the Commissioner s demand  In the demand  the Commissioner relied on Caltex s failure to keep the goods safely  and or  its failure to account upon request  For the reasons I have given  it was not open to the Commissioner to rely on a failure to account under s  b  to support the demand  Neither party made any submissions as to where this left the demand citedPhilip Morris Ltd v Commissioner of Business Franchises  Victoria    HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Another way of considering this is by reference to s    Section   renders all excisable goods  subject to  the Commissioner s  control until delivered for home consumption or for exportation to a place outside Australia  whichever occurs first   The control residing with the Commissioner is of broad scope and is critical for the protection of the Commonwealth s excise revenue  see Lyon   HCA       CLR   and Collector of Customs  New South Wales  v Southern Shipping Co Ltd   HCA         CLR     Southern Shipping    The section contemplates that excisable goods will be delivered for either home consumption or exportation  In my view the section evinces a legislative intention to cover the field in respect of all forms of internal  home  consumption and all exports  Historically  excise duties have been understood as running together with and supplementary to the customs duties traditionally imposed on certain goods  In Philip Morris Ltd v Commissioner of Business Franchises  Victoria    HCA         CLR   at   Mason CJ and Deane J approved the following passage from Quick and Garran s Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth   The fundamental conception of the term  excise  is that of a tax on articles produced or manufactured in a country  In the taxation of such articles of luxury  as spirits  beer  tobacco  and cigars  it has been the practice to place a certain duty on the importation of these articles and a corresponding or reduced duty on similar articles produced or manufactured in the country  and this is the sense in which excise duties have been understood in the Australian colonies  and in which the expression was intended to be used in the Constitution of the Commonwealth followedSidebottom v Giuliano   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Caltex has sought to have the demand set aside for invalidity  on the following grounds   a  The residual oils are not  excisable goods  and s   has no application to them    b  Section   applies only to excisable goods that are  subject to the  Commissioner s  control   If as the Commissioner contended the residual oils were delivered for home consumption  then they were thereupon no longer subject to the Commissioner s control and s   does not apply    c  Caltex did not  fail to keep  the residual oils  safely   The safety with which s  a  is concerned is that the goods do not find their way into home consumption without the payment of duty  It is not directed at the protection of goods from damage or destruction  relying on Southern Shipping   CLR at    Taylor J  and    Menzies J   As the residual oils were  destroyed  by Caltex and did not and were never intended to find their way into home consumption  there was no failure to keep them safely for the purposes of s  a      d  The Commissioner was not entitled to make a request pursuant to s  b  nor to rely on that paragraph in the demand as a basis for liability  Section  b  may only be invoked when there is doubt about the whereabouts of goods or doubt as to whether they have been kept safely  relying on Sidebottom v Giuliano   FCA         FCR     Sidebottom    There was no doubt as to whether Caltex had failed to keep the residual oils safely  The Commissioner was aware that the residual oils had been burnt at Caltex s refineries  In particular  he acknowledged that the residual oils had been  used to generate energy within Caltex s refineries  in the purported request he made under s  b      e  Even if the Commissioner was entitled to make the s  b  request  Caltex properly accounted for the residual oils by explaining that they had been used to generate heat  which thereby demonstrated they had not gone into home consumption    f  The demand is invalid because it claimed payment of a  debt   Liability under s   only arises upon the due making of a valid demand  Accordingly Caltex could not have owed the amount demanded prior to the making of the demand and its description as a debt renders the demand invalid   In relation to  b  Caltex s submission has the effect that s   could only operate where excisable goods have not in fact been delivered for home consumption  The Commissioner submitted that s   applies whether or not goods have been delivered for home consumption  He emphasised that the purpose of the Commissioner s control over excisable goods is to ensure that duty is properly paid  relying on Lyon   HCA       CLR   and Southern Shipping   HCA       CLR   and the obligations imposed by s   are designed to ensure that the goods do not find their way into home consumption without proper payment  relying on Sidebottom   FCA       FCR    More particularly the Commissioner said that s   is aimed directly at the unauthorised relinquishment of possession  which would include delivering goods for home consumption in a manner that was not authorised  principally where there is no payment of duty   In relation to the failure to keep safely point at  c  the Commissioner relied on the decision of Finkelstein J in Sidebottom   FCA       FCR   and his Honour s discussion of the purposes of s   as explained by the High Court in Southern Shipping   HCA       CLR    What is clear from each of those cases is that s   imposes an essentially absolute duty to keep goods safely and to ensure they do not find their way into home consumption without the payment of duty  Where that does occur  the goods will have found their way into home consumption  irregularly  that is  in a manner not authorised by the Excise Act   and s   will apply in order that the revenue might be protected  The Commissioner said that the residual oils found their way into home consumption irregularly when Caltex consumed them without duty having been paid  I agree  As I said earlier  Caltex s consumption of the residual oils at its refineries amounted to  home consumption   It follows that Caltex s dedication of the residual oils as refinery fuel oil  without paying excise duty  and subsequent consumption of them by burning them  means that they found their way into home consumption irregularly  Caltex s consumption of the residual oils in this manner  by burning and thus using them up or  destroying  them  was therefore a failure to keep them safely within s  a   As Dixon CJ said in Southern Shipping   CLR at   the safe keeping comprehended by s  a  is the keeping safe from loss or destruction  because  the provision is pointed at the loss of goods involving the loss of excise duty   Caltex relied on the judgments of Taylor J  at   and Menzies J  at   in Southern Shipping   HCA       CLR   and their Honours  references to damage or destruction  However  their observations were directed not to a case such as the present  where the  destruction  is the consumption of the residual oils as a fuel  but to a rejection of the proposition that the section imposes a duty of care not to permit goods to be damaged or destroyed   I now turn to Caltex s submission at  d   The Commissioner acknowledged that it was entitled to request an account only where the safety of the relevant goods is something less than an  undoubted  fact  see Southern Shipping   CLR at    Owen J  Sidebottom   FCA       FCR   at    Finkelstein J   It said that the section was directed to an account that shows either        an unauthorised relinquishment of possession    despite an unauthorised loss of possession  that the goods have not gone into home consumption without payment of duty  or    despite a failure to keep them safely  the Commissioner s control over the goods is still effective  see Southern Shipping   CLR at    Menzies J  If it were an undoubted fact that Caltex had failed to keep the residual oils safely because it burnt them  then s  b  would not be available to the Commissioner  Sidebottom   FCA       FCR    Conversely  if the position with respect to the residual oils was something less than an undoubted fact  it was open to the Commissioner to invoke s  b    It seems to me that it was common ground from the outset that Caltex had consumed all of the residual oils and that no duty had been paid in respect of them  The premise of the Commissioner s conclusion in the Advice that the residual oils had been delivered for home consumption and had not been accounted for  the latter of which  curiously  was not based on any request to account at that stage  was that the residual oils had been burnt by Caltex as a fuel oil  Moreover  in the Commissioner s request under s  b  itself  he acknowledged that the residual oils had already been burnt  The only thing that could possibly have remained in any doubt was whether Caltex had paid duty  but that was not the case  The Commissioner had already stated in the Advice that  the  residual oil  that you are manufacturing is no longer present within the licensed premises and duty has not been paid    In my view there was no doubt about the whereabouts of the residual oils or whether they had been  at least on the Commissioner s construction of s  a    kept safely  This is not a case where the location of the goods  and therefore whether they had gone into home consumption  was unknown  cf  Moama   FCA       FCR     or a case where the Commissioner only had  evidence which might lead him to form the opinion that excisable goods were not kept safely   see Sidebottom   FCA       FCR   at      The facts here were clear the residual oils had been consumed by Caltex at its premises without the payment of any duty   Accordingly I do not consider that the Commissioner was entitled to make the request pursuant to s  b  see Sidebottom   FCA       FCR   at    distinguishedDanmark Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation

v Bartley   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Assuming they fall within the Schedule  the impost in this case is levied directly on the residual oils as the  subjects of manufacture  and affects them as commodities in the hands of Caltex  The residual oils are of use to Caltex and serve an economic purpose  Without them Caltex would need to acquire fuel oil from an alternative source at higher cost  The impost is not levied upon the consumption of the residual oils by Caltex  Nor is it a tax on the ownership of the residual oils  It is an excise in the most obvious sense  a tax upon the step of manufacturing or producing a defined good  In my view  to accept the limitation contended for by Caltex would be counter to the trend of the High Court s decision making from the early decision in Peterswald v Bartley   HCA         CLR   through to Ha   HCA       CLR     which has been to enlarge the field of permissible steps of taxation in the context of

v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR   at     I would ask whether it was a purpose of s   that to wrongly describe  an amount equal to the amount of the Excise duty which would have been payable      as a debt  when it is quite clear what is being demanded and why  should result in invalidity  Caltex did not advance any argument as to why such an error should result in invalidity  whether on a Project Blue Sky approach or otherwise   As I have found the residual oils not to be  refined  or  semi refined  products  they are not subject to excise duty under item   of the Tariff Act  Accordingly the Commissioner s objection decision the subject of the tax appeal must be set aside  together with the demand made by the Commissioner pursuant to s   of the Excise Act   The Commissioner should pay Caltex s costs of the tax appeal   The s  B proceeding is in substance dealt with by the result of the tax appeal  But for the agreement referred to at   it would have been
