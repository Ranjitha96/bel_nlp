Whittaker v Child Support Registrar   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedAllstate Life Insurance Co v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlI discussed this question of the required state of mind of the inducer in a case of inducing breach of contract in Allstate Life Insurance Co v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd   FCA         FCR     Allstate   at    in a judgment with which Lockhart and Tamberlin JJ agreed   Malice  in the sense of spite or ill will  is not an element of that tort  Zhu v Treasurer of the State of New South Wales   HCA         CLR   at     cf Northern Territory of Australia v Mengel     CLR     Mengel   at     citedBruce v Odhams Press  Limited     KB  The leading authority for that proposition is the judgment of Scott LJ in Bruce v Odhams Press  Limited     KB    His Lordship described the difference between a statement of material facts and particulars in the following terms  at      A  radical distinction  and none the less so that in cases near the dividing line there is a penumbra where the two may and often do overlap  just as between night and day there is zone of doubt which we call dusk     His Lordship said  at   that a statement of the material facts is a statement of the facts necessary to constitute a complete cause of action  He said that  particulars  are not to be used in order to fill material gaps in a statement of claim  His Lordship said  at       The use of particulars is intended to meet a further and quite separate requirement of pleading  imposed in fairness and justice to the defendant  Their function is to fill in the picture of the plaintiff s cause of action with information sufficiently detailed to put the defendant on his guard as to the case he has to meet and to enable him to prepare for trial  Consequently in strictness particulars cannot cure a bad statement of claim  But in practice it is often difficult to distinguish between a  material fact  and a  particular  piece of information which it is reasonable to give the defendant in order to tell him the case he has to meet  hence in the nature of things there is often overlapping  And the practice of sometimes putting particulars into the statement of claim and sometimes delivering them afterwards either voluntarily  or upon request or order  without any reflection as to the true legal ground upon which they are to be given has become so common that it has tended to obscure the very real distinction between them  Bruce v Odhams Press  Limited was a defamation case  The defendant company had published a newspaper article which referred to certain aeroplane smuggling exploits of  an Englishwoman   By her statement of claim  the plaintiff merely asserted that these words were meant and were understood to mean her  This was held to be failure to plead material facts  It was necessary for the plaintiff to plead extrinsic facts on which she would rely to link the words  an Englishwoman  to herself  In H   Nominees Pty Ltd v Galli and Apex Quarries Ltd   above  Northrop J  following Scott LJ in Bruce v Odhams Press  Limited   rejected  at   an argument that the particulars to a paragraph of a statement of claim should be treated as a statement of material facts for the purposes of the Federal Court Rules  citedH   Nominees Pty Ltd v Galli and Apex Quarries Ltd     ALR       FLR  The respondents cite H   Nominees Pty Ltd v Galli and Apex Quarries Ltd     ALR       FLR   and Trade Practices Commission v David Jones  Australia  Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   for the proposition that the material facts must be stated in the text of a pleading  not in  particulars   In H   Nominees Pty Ltd v Galli and Apex Quarries Ltd   above  Northrop J  following Scott LJ in Bruce v Odhams Press  Limited   rejected  at   an argument that the particulars to a paragraph of a statement of claim should be treated as a statement of material facts for the purposes of the Federal Court Rules  citedHospitality Group Pty Ltd v Australian Rugby Union Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe present case is not one of the Commonwealth officers  having induced Rotary or Mr Whittaker or both to decide to breach contracts giving rise to a secondary liability of the Commonwealth to the other contracting parties  Yet counsel for the applicants cited Hospitality Group Pty Ltd v Australian Rugby Union Ltd   FCA         FCR     a case of inducement of a breach of contract  If it is anything  the present case is one of direct interference by unlawful means with the performance by Rotary and Mr Whittaker of the respective contracts citedLumley v Gye     El   Bl     ER  There is  however  a more fundamental question which was also not raised on the hearing  This is whether the action lies for the benefit of Mr Whittaker and Rotary at all  The action for inducement of breach of contract does not lie for the benefit of the contract breaker  It lies only for the benefit of the other contracting party  Much of the debate on the hearing treated the claim as a species of inducement of breach of contract of the Lumley v Gye     El   Bl     ER   kind  yet this point was not raised  Is the position different when the claim is for direct interference with contractual relations by unlawful means  It may well be  On the other hand  the argument is open that it is no different  and that the applicants  remedy includes a claim for their economic loss in the damages they seek to recover for some other tort  such as  false imprisonment  In conclusion  the  Heads of Loss and Damage  document filed by the applicants on   April   showed that the allegation is not that the supply contract was breached  but that additional costs were incurred by the applicants in connection with its performance  Again  on the hearing it seems to have been assumed by both counsel that the applicants  claim was that the Commonwealth  through its officers  had prevented performance of the contracts  Paragraphs   and   will be struck out with leave to replead  The most careful consideration will need to be given as to what cause of action  if any  can properly be pleaded in their place  If claims are to be pursued for direct interference with contractual relations by unlawful means  they must be separately pleaded in respect of each applicant and each of the three contracts  Interference with trade paragraph  appliedLuton v Lessels   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThere is no substance in these attacks  see Luton v Lessels   HCA         CLR    Mr Whittaker has previously taken these contentions to the stage of a special leave application before the High Court  see Whittaker v Child Support Registrar   HCATrans    Special leave was refused  Previously Mr Whittaker s judicial power argument was rejected by Drummond J in Whittaker v Child Support Registrar   FCA         FCR   and Dowsett J in Whittaker v Child Support Registrar   FCA    His taxation power argument was rejected by Dowsett J in Whittaker v Child Support Registrar   FCA    On appeal  the Full Court held that Luton v Lessels  foreclos ed  any constitutional challenge    Whittaker v Child Support Registrar   FCAFC   at      As noted above  the High Court refused special leave to appeal  Further  an attempt to limit the scope of the operation of Luton v Lessels failed in Weekes and Child Support Registrar   FLC p        FamCA    Mr Whittaker  in person with leave  submitted that Luton v Lessels does not constitute a binding precedent because the originating process on the High Court file in that case did not bear the seal of the High Court  The submission is devoid of merit  I also note that the deletion of para   in the further amended application was consistent with an abandonment of the submission  Torts in relation to tax file numbers paragraphs     and  These paragraphs are as follows  Further or alternatively  prior to making the DPO on or about   December   the First Respondent negligently or in

Insurance Co v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd   FCA         FCR     Allstate   at    in a judgment with which Lockhart and Tamberlin JJ agreed   Malice  in the sense of spite or ill will

interference with trade or business interests by unlawful means  as distinct from interference with contractual relations  has not yet been recognised by the High Court  although neither has it been rejected  In Mengel at   and Sanders v Snell   HCA         CLR   at         it was referred to as an embryonic or emerging tort  For the purposes of the present motion  I proceed on the assumption that it forms part of Australian law discussedOBG Ltd v Allan  Douglas v Hello  Ltd  No   Mainstream Properties Ltd v Young     AC  Recently in OBG Ltd v Allan  Douglas v Hello  Ltd  No   Mainstream Properties Ltd v Young     AC     OBG   the members of the House of Lords had occasion to consider in detail the elements of the torts of  inducing a breach of contract  and  interference with contractual relations by unlawful means   The former is a secondary liability  the primary liability being that of the contract breaker  The latter is a primary liability alone  Because the matter was not debated before me  I simply refer the parties  especially the applicants  to the discussion of the elements of the tort of direct interference with contractual relations by unlawful means in OBG   In particular  they will need to consider  a  the unlawful means element  and  b  the element of the required state of mind of the respondents in the case of that species of tortious conduct  as distinct from the required state of mind in the case of inducing a breach of contract citedRanger Uranium Mines Pty Ltd v Federated Miscellaneous Workers  Union of Australia     FLR  Admittedly  the two bases of liability to which I have referred have often not been distinguished  Direct physical prevention of contractual performance by unlawful means has been treated as a species of inducing a breach of contract  See  for example  Ranger Uranium Mines Pty Ltd v Federated Miscellaneous Workers  Union of Australia     FLR   at      In Trindade  Cane and Lunney  The Law of Torts in Australia   th ed  OUP    the authors give as an example of the procurement of a breach of contract  a defendant s physically detaining a contracting party or depriving him of his tools  so that he cannot perform a contract with the plaintiff  at         p    See  too  John Murphy  Street on Torts   th ed  OUP    at     and The Laws of Australia  Lawbook Co   subscription service    Torts at      It will be necessary for the pleading to be amended in order to conform  not with the notion of inducing or procuring a breach of contract  but with that of direct inference by unlawful means with the performance of a contract citedSanders v Snell   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlA tort of interference with trade or business interests by unlawful means  as distinct from interference with contractual relations  has not yet been recognised by the High Court  although neither has it been rejected  In Mengel at   and Sanders v Snell   HCA         CLR   at         it was referred to as an embryonic or emerging tort  For the purposes of the present motion  I proceed on the assumption that it forms part of Australian law  I do not understand the basis on which  interference with trade  is pleaded as distinct from a pleading of interference with contractual relations by unlawful means  If the tort is recognised  the unlawfulness concerned will be not just unauthorised conduct but prohibited conduct  see Sanders v Snell   above  at      Counsel for Mr Whittaker puts the interference with trade case on two bases  an intentional interference with the business of the applicants  or an interference with their business by illegal means   The former seems to be nothing other than the claim of interference with contractual relations  As to the alternative  the illegal means identified is  the threat of an illegal act  namely what we have previously pleaded  or alternatively illegal false imprisonment  or alternatively trespass to goods   The  illegal means  must be pleaded with specificity   What we have previously pleaded  is not good enough  As well  I do not understand how a threat of false imprisonment or a threat of trespass to goods  without more  could have interfered with the applicants  trade  Unlike paras   and   para   does not state that it is based on  the premises  of paras   and    It seems to add no cause of action beyond that of interference with the performance of the three contracts  Unless  interference with trade  is intended to be different  and the difference is clearly articulated  it should not be repleaded citedTrade Practices Commission v David Jones  Australia  Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe respondents cite H   Nominees Pty Ltd v Galli and Apex Quarries Ltd     ALR       FLR   and Trade Practices Commission v David Jones  Australia  Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   for the proposition that the material facts must be stated in the text of a pleading  not in  particulars   The distinction between material facts and particulars was recognised by Fisher J in Trade Practices Commission v David Jones  Australia  Pty Ltd  above  at   ff   His Honour described the paragraph of the statement of claim in question in that case as  merely a statement of a conclusion drawn from facts which are not in the statement of claim   at    The paragraph pleaded that certain respondents had  made an arrangement or arrived at an understanding   The deficiency in that allegation was not cured by the giving of particulars of the individuals who had represented those respondents at a certain meeting  the date and place of the meeting  the identity of those present  and the effect of the arrangement or understanding  It may be that the distinction between material facts and particulars is not insisted upon as strictly nowadays as it was a few decades ago  An advantage of maintaining the distinction is that it emphasises  for the benefit of both the parties and the Court  that the applicant s position is that it is the facts pleaded in the text of the statement of claim  no more and no less  that the applicant needs to prove in order to establish the asserted cause of action  So long as the distinction is understood and observed  there will not be the confusion that arises when either party  if and when it suits its own purposes  refers to the particulars as if they formed an undifferentiated part of the pleading  The text of paras   and   is deficient  The expression  deprived him of his liberty  may mean  locked him in a room   forcibly man handled him into a room and stood guard at the doorway   handcuffed him   encircled him  and so on  The expression  restraining him  is subject to the same kind of criticism

paragraphs is that they are premised upon reasoning that led to the original paragraph   of the Amended Application  The respondents contended that there should be summary dismissal of that part of the proceedings relating to     this aspect of the case  The respondents  submissions in the summary judgment motion  which did not proceed to judgment  included the following   In any event  and more importantly  the underlying premise of the relief is misconceived and should be the subject of summary dismissal as having no reasonable prospect of success      The relief is premised upon the view that s  WB  of the Taxation Administration Act    Cth  prevents the Registrar from exercising powers under ss  C  of the Registration Act  a reference to the Collection Act  or s  D  of the Assessment Act to require the Commissioner of Taxation to provide the Registrar with information about people  including their tax file numbers  unless and until the person or persons concerned have first provided statements under ss  B  or   and  C  or   of those respective Acts      The short answer is that s  WB  of the Taxation Administration Act does not apply in connection with the Registrar exercising powers or performing functions under  or in relation to  the Assessment Act and the Registration Act   see s  WB A b  of the Taxation Administration Act and s  ga  of the Income Tax Assessment Act    Cth       This argument or one materially identical was considered and rejected by Dowsett J in Whittaker v Child Support Registrar   FCA   at         It has not merit whatsoever and this part of the proceeding should be summarily dismissed under s  A of the Federal Court of Australia Act   Section  C  of the Collection Act and s  D  of the Assessment Act empower the Registrar to require the Commissioner of Taxation to provide the Registrar with information about people  including tax file numbers  being information that is in the possession of the Commissioner  In each case  information provided by the Commissioner to the Registrar may be used only for the purposes that are specified in s  C  or  D  as the case may be  The general prohibition of s  WB of the TA Act and the power given by the Assessment Act to the Registrar do not impinge on the specific powers given to the Registrar by s  C of the Collection Act and s  D of the Assessment Act citedWhittaker v Child
