Management v Ringfab Environmental Structures Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlCounsel for the respondents has submitted that the relevant principles which should guide me in considering his clients  application were summarised by Lee J in Executive Director of the Department of Conservation and Land Management v Ringfab Environmental Structures Pty Ltd   FCA    In that case  his Honour said      Section   of the Corporations Law requires the leave of the Court to be obtained before an action may be commenced against a company in liquidation  The purpose of such a provision is to prevent a company in liquidation being subjected to actions that are expensive and  therefore  carried on at the expense of the creditors of the company and  perhaps  unnecessarily  Fielding v Vagrand Pty Ltd  In Liquidation      ACLC   at   Ogilvie Grant v East     ACLC   at   Maher v Taylor     ACLR   at   Re A J Benjamin Ltd  In Liquidation      WN  Pt    NSW    at     In determining whether leave should be granted  the Court considers whether the balance of convenience lies in allowing the applicant to proceed by way of action to judgment  or whether the applicant should be left to pursue his claim by lodging a proof of debt with the liquidator  The matter is one of discretion and the onus is on the applicant to demonstrate why it is more appropriate  in respect of a particular claim  to proceed by way of action  Fielding v Vagrand at   Ogilvie Grant v East at   Stewart v Intercity Distributors Limited   NZLR   at      For leave to be granted  it must be shown that there is a serious or substantial question to be tried  Oceanic Life v Insurance   Retirement Planning Services Pty Ltd  In Liquidation      ACLC   at   Olgilvie Grant v East at   and a real dispute between the parties  Fielding v Vagrand at   Zempilas v J N Taylor Holdings Ltd  In Provisional Liquidation   No       ACLC   at   Capita Financial Group Ltd v Rothwells Ltd  No       ACLC   at    Leave will not be granted where the applicant does not have a genuine claim or where the claim would be futile  Hence  leave has been refused where the claim has been for unliquidated damages arising otherwise than by reason of a contract  promise  or breach of trust  on the basis that by virtue of the joint application of s   Bankruptcy Act    Cth    Bankruptcy Act   and s   of the Corporations Law  or equivalent provisions  such a claim would not be provable in the winding up of an insolvent company unless judgment had been entered prior to the order for winding up  Re Autolook Pty Ltd  O Brien v Bills     ACLC   at   Re A J Benjamin Ltd  In Liquidation  at   Page v Commonwealth Life Assurance Society Ltd     SR  NSW    at   In re Southern Cross Coaches Ltd     WN   Cutten and Harvey v Mount     SASR     Fielding v Vagrand at     cf Re Berkeley Securities  Property  Ltd     All ER      As a result of amendments to the Corporations Law in    see ss   and  E  s   of the Bankruptcy Act is no longer imported into the Corporations Law   and a claim for damages against Nericon would no longer be futile for that reason  However  nonetheless it may be inappropriate in all the circumstances to grant leave in respect of such a claim  The orderly winding up of Nericon and the interests of Nericon s existing unsecured creditors must also be taken into account  Oceanic Life Ltd v Insurance and Retirement Planning Services Pty at    In a situation such as the present  where the liquidator has no funds to conduct a defence and there is little prospect of funds becoming available and the company is not insured against the damages sought  there is strong reason for refusing leave  Maher v Taylor at   Re A J Benjamin at      Furthermore  claims against Nericon cannot be sustained unless CALM succeeds in its claims against the first and second respondents   With respect to the declaratory and injunctive relief  it is a factor in favour of granting leave that the relief cannot be obtained otherwise than by a successful application to the Court  Vagrand Pty Ltd  In Liquidation  v Fielding     ACLC   at   Fielding v Vagrand at   Wyley v Exhall Coal Mining Co Ltd     Beav    The real purpose of the application to join Nericon is to obtain orders that will bind it in the event that the claims against the first and second respondents are made out  Another matter to consider in granting leave is that the joinder would enable the liquidator to participate in the mediation process provided by this Court and being used by the existing parties  However  these purposes can be achieved without Nericon actively participating in the proceedings as a respondent  It is likely that the declaratory and injunctive relief sought by CALM against Nericon could be obtained by consent  if CALM succeeded against either the first or the second respondent  On the material before the Court it is apparent that at least the second respondent will contest the applicant s claims  In view of the undertaking given by the liquidator  CALM s position is protected as far as Nericon is concerned and no interlocutory proceeding against Nericon is required  If circumstances change CALM may apply to vary the order I propose to make  Meanwhile  if it considers it appropriate CALM may lodge a proof of debt with the liquidator   A grant of leave can be made subject to conditions directed at minimising interference with the orderly winding up of the company in liquidation  Oceanic Life Ltd v Insurance and Retirement Planning Services Pty Ltd at    In the present case  it is appropriate in all the circumstances that leave be granted to join Nericon to the proceedings  the proceeding against Nericon being restricted to claims for declaratory and injunctive relief and not to include a claim for damages or account of profits  In addition  Nericon will not be required to participate in the proceeding by filing a defence or taking any other step  In essence  the applicant for leave must satisfy the Court that there is a serious or substantial question to be tried and that the interests of justice  including the balance of convenience  would be best served by the applicant for leave being permitted to proceed  The fact that a money judgment may not be ordered is not determinative  The prospect of making declarations may justify the grant of leave  One matter which is often important is whether the applicant for leave should be left to pursue his claim by lodging a proof of debt  In the present case there will almost certainly be difficulties in the respondents successfully lodging a proof of debt in the liquidation of Bedrock  However  this is not a significant matter in this case  since there is no prospect that any funds will be available to meet such a proof in any event  Although initially I had some reservations about granting the leave which the respondents seek  the respondents have now satisfied me that it is appropriate  in the present case  to make an order in the terms of the usual order made in cases such as this  I am prepared to make those orders because the subject matter of the contraventions alleged against Bedrock is serious and involves an important matter concerning the regulation of workers  safety and should  therefore  receive the consideration of the Court in the way contemplated by the reasoning of Lee J in Ringfab Environmental Structures Pty Ltd   FCA     notwithstanding the fact that the Court may not order any monetary judgment in favour of the respondents against Bedrock and notwithstanding the fact that Bedrock has no assets  For these reasons I propose to make the orders sought    I certify that the preceding fifteen   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the
