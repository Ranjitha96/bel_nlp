Brady King Pty Ltd v The Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia  No     FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedBoland v Yates Property Corporation Pty Ltd   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Boland v Yates Property Corporation Pty Ltd   HCA         ALR         at     Callinan J  although obiter  referred to this method     This court itself has in any event clearly accepted what has been described as the hypothetical development method of valuation  The method was described by Starke J in Australian Provincial Assurance Association Ltd v Commissioner of Land Tax      In the present case the valuation has been made on what has been variously described as the hypothetical building or development basis  The parties agree that the building upon the land does not return the rental that might reasonably be expected from it  So the rental from that building is discarded  and it is assumed that the land is vacant  The erection of a new building on the land is envisaged  providing office accommodation  which is the best method of obtaining the advantages that the land possesses  Accordingly a building is planned to obtain the full benefit of those advantages  Its cost is estimated  the gross annual rentals or receipts from it are estimated  and from these rentals or receipts are deducted various annual outgoings and interest charges which are also estimated to obtain the net receipts  The capital value of the land is then ascertained by capitalising the net receipts at some given rate of interest  and in this case  I may add  the parties were content to work upon a     basis  The unimproved value of the land is then deduced by deducting from the capital value so obtained the cost of the erection of the building  Adopting this method of ascertaining the unimproved value of the assessed land  I find as a fact that its unimproved value on   June   was the sum of  sterling          The method is neither novel nor especially difficult  and  as with all methods  requires the making of value judgments appliedCloser Settlement Ltd v The Minister     LGR  NSW    The methodology was also explained by Roper J  as he then was  in Closer Settlement Ltd v The Minister     LGR  NSW     at   In arriving at the value of land which is suitable for subdivision a familiar and appropriate method     is to estimate from whatever comparable sales of land in subdivision are available the price which would be realized by the land when sold  then to estimate the costs involved in the subdivision and the length of time that the realization would take  making provision for the payment of rates and for interest on money outstanding  and an estimated net return on the subdivision is obtained  It is of course clear that a person purchasing land in globo for the purpose of subdividing it would not pay the sum of money which is the present equivalent of that estimated return  Many factors in the calculation are speculative  the land in subdivision may not realize the prices which are at present expected  and the subdivision may take longer to realize than is at present anticipated  To compensate for the risk involved in the venture the purchaser would certainly discount the estimated returns   See also Port Stephens Shire Council v Tellamist Pty Ltd   NSWCA   at          However  whichever method is used  it would be necessary for a valuer to use  or at least take account of  market transactions for the purpose of obtaining basic information   see Alan Hyam  The Law Affecting Valuation of Land in Australia   rd ed   by at   and the above comments of Roper J  as he then was  in Closer Settlement   LGR  NSW     This would include all relevant sales data available to a valuer which could impact on his valuation   In my view  the appropriate way to proceed is to start with the question of whether the valuation complies with s     of the GST Act  To be a compliant valuation it must accord with the Determination  If a valuation complies with the Determination  then the valuation is valid and operative for the purposes of s      However  if the valuation fails to comply with the Determination  then the question will arise as to the consequences of such failure   The Commissioner contended that it appeared to be Mr Nicodimou s view that the relevant valuation principles positively forbade him from considering any information that post dated   July   in order to ascertain the market value of the strata units as at   July    I agree that  if Mr Nicodimou held this view  it would be a fundamentally incorrect view  see  eg  McCathie v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR         Melwood Units Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Main Roads   AC       and Closer Settlement   LGR  NSW    citedFaheem Khalid Lodhi v R   NSWCA  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  Mason J  as he then was  with Gibbs J  as he then was  agreeing  said  at   When sub s   directs the Permanent Head to  have regard to  the costs  it requires him to take those costs into account and to give weight to them as a fundamental element in making his determination   The Commissioner also referred to The Queen v Toohey  Ex parte Meneling Station Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR       per Gibbs CJ and Faheem Khalid Lodhi v R   NSWCA     at   per Spigelman CJ appliedGwynvill Properties Pty Ltd v Commissioner for Main Roads     LGRA   In Gwynvill Properties Pty Ltd v Commissioner for Main Roads     LGRA   Cripps J made the following observation  at   The hypothetical development method is normally suspect because it depends on a number of assumptions and a number of estimates  e g  cost of building  estimated gross rentals obtainable  probable outgoings and  most significantly  the rate percentum of return which could be expected and the profit and risk factor expressed in percentage terms  It has been said that because many estimates and assumptions must be made  the hypothetical development method ought not be used where some use can be made of a comparable sale appliedHunter Resources Ltd v Melville   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In some cases  compliance with a statutory requirement allows for no middle course  and is obligatory  see Hunter Resources Ltd v Melville   HCA         CLR       per Dawson J   In the case of a valuation under the Determination  it is clear that a valuation must be provided by a professional valuer  There could be no middle course here  if not provided by a professional valuation there would be no  valuation  citedLegal   General Life of Australia Ltd v Hudson Pty Ltd     NSWLR   It was submitted by the taxpayer that a valuation under s        is  or is akin to  an expert determination that is only open to challenge on a narrow set of grounds  Reliance was placed upon comments of McHugh J  then a member of the New South Wales Court of Appeal  in Legal   General Life of Australia Ltd v Hudson Pty Ltd     NSWLR   where his Honour said that  at       While mistake or error on the part of the valuer is not by itself sufficient to invalidate the decision or the certificate of valuation  nevertheless  the mistake may be of a kind which shows that the valuation is not in accordance with the contract  A mistake concerning the identity of the premises to be valued could seldom  if ever  comply with the terms of the agreement between the parties  But a valuation which is the result of the mistaken application of the principles of valuation may still be made in accordance with the terms of the agreement  In each case the critical question must always be  Was the valuation made in accordance with the terms of a contract  If it is  it is nothing to the point that the valuation may have proceeded on the basis of error or that it constitutes a gross over or under value  Nor is it relevant that the valuer has taken into consideration matters which he should not have taken into account or has failed to take into account matters which he should have taken into account  The question is not whether there is an error in the discretionary judgment of the valuer  It is whether the valuation complies with the terms of the contract   It was then submitted that although this decision concerned a valuation made under a contract  by adopting a valuation made in accordance with requirements specified by the Commissioner  s        establishes a means for determining value that is comparable to a contractual provision  The section does not provide any mechanism for such a valuation to be challenged  It was therefore of similar effect to a contractual term requiring the parties to abide by a valuation obtained in accordance with the contract  It was submitted that the Court should therefore adopt the principles set out in Legal   General Life of Australia Ltd   NSWLR   when determining what the Commissioner must establish in order to overturn Mr Nicodimou s valuation   The taxpayer alternatively submitted that the valuation should be reviewed in accordance with the ordinary principles of administrative law  A relevant matter to take into account is only a matter that the valuer is  bound  to take into account  The taxpayer submitted that the only relevant matters were specifically set out in what is described as Method   of the Determination appliedMcCathie v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Commissioner contended that it appeared to be Mr Nicodimou s view that the relevant valuation principles positively forbade him from considering any information that post dated   July   in order to ascertain the

austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The taxpayer referred to Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR   where Mason J  as he then was  identified the following propositions in connection with a failure to take into account a relevant consideration  at          a  The ground of failure to take into account a relevant consideration can only be made out if a decision maker fails to take into account a consideration which he is bound to take into account in making that decision               b  What factors a decision maker is bound to consider in making the decision is determined by construction of the statute conferring the discretion  If the statute expressly states the considerations to be taken into account  it will often be necessary for the court to decide whether those enumerated factors are exhaustive or merely inclusive  If the relevant factors    and in this context I use this expression to refer to the factors which the decision maker is bound to consider    are not expressly stated  they must be determined by implication from the subject matter  scope and purpose of the Act  In the context of judicial review on the ground of taking into account irrelevant considerations  this Court has held that  where a statute confers a discretion which in its terms is unconfined  the factors that may be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion are similarly unconfined  except in so far as there may be found in the subject matter  scope and purpose of the statute some implied limitation on the factors to which the decision maker may legitimately have regard      By analogy  where the ground of review is that a relevant consideration has not been taken into account and the discretion is unconfined by the terms of the statute  the court will not find that the decision maker is bound to take a particular matter into account unless an implication that he is bound to do so is to be found in the subject matter  scope and purpose of the Act           c  Not every consideration that a decision maker is bound to take into account but fails to take into account will justify the court setting aside the impugned decision and ordering that the discretion be re exercised according to law  A factor might be so insignificant that the failure to take it into account could not have materially affected the decision               d  The limited role of a court reviewing the exercise of an administrative discretion must constantly be borne in mind  It is not the function of the court to substitute its own decision for that of the administrator by exercising a discretion which the legislature has vested in the administrator  Its role is to set limits on the exercise of that discretion  and a decision made within those boundaries cannot be impugned      It follows that  in the absence of any statutory indication of the weight to be given to various considerations  it is generally for the decision maker and not the court to determine the appropriate weight to be given to the matters which are required to be taken into account in exercising the statutory power   references omitted  Before I go to the appropriate approach to take in consideration of the GST Act and the Determination  Method   of the Determination provided for what is known as the hypothetical development method of valuation  It is convenient to briefly describe this valuation method   In considering this matter  I have not found much assistance from the cases relied on by the taxpayer  The question is one of compliance with a statutory requirement and the consequences of any non compliance  We are not dealing with a contractual setting  nor with the exercise of a power by a public official  However  even if it were appropriate to apply by analogy the principles referred to in Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA       CLR     no different result would be reached in this proceeding  In the end it is a matter of determining what factors the professional valuer was bound to consider  and then to determine whether the failure to take into account a particular factor would result in invalidity   It is thus now necessary to address the application of Method   by Mr Nicodimou   As set out in cl   of the Determination  the methodology requires the valuer to assess the market value of the completed premises as at   July   and then subtract from this figure the costs to complete the partially completed premises and the profit margin and holding costs  What is left is the price that the hypothetical developer would pay for the partially completed premises on   July   and that is the value of those premises on   July   appliedPort Stephens Shire Council v Tellamist Pty Ltd   NSWCA   The methodology was also explained by Roper J  as he then was  in Closer Settlement Ltd v The Minister     LGR  NSW     at   In arriving at the value of land which is suitable for subdivision a familiar and appropriate method     is to estimate from whatever comparable sales of land in subdivision are available the price which would be realized by the land when sold  then to estimate the costs involved in the subdivision and the

appliedProject Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  This approach involves an analysis of the construction of the GST Act  and the result of any non compliance being determined by reference to that construction  see  eg  Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR         and Tasker v Fullwood     NSWLR       appliedR v Hunt  Ex parte Sean Investments Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The parties referred to a number of cases on various aspects of the operation of the GST Act and the Determination  The Commissioner submitted that the leading case on the meaning of statutory provisions that require the relevant person to  have regard to  certain matters is R v Hunt  Ex parte Sean Investments Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR    That case dealt with sub s  AA  of the National Health Act    Cth  which provided  The Permanent Head shall  in determining the scale of fees     have regard to costs necessarily incurred in providing nursing home care in the nursing home   Equally the valuer  must  have regard to three matters  the market value of the completed premises  the cost to complete the partly completed premises  and the profit margin and holding costs that are attributable to the period on or after the valuation date  Further  these matters would need to be given appropriate weight as important or essential elements in the making of the valuation  see R v Hunt   HCA       CLR        If the valuer did not have regard to these three matters  nor give them appropriate weight  then the language of s     and purpose for the valuation coming into existence  indicate that the valuation would be invalid and of no operation for the purposes of the Determination   However  just because another valuer may come to a different valuation figure does not mean that the valuation relied on may not be in compliance with the requirements of s     and the Determination  Within any valuation there will be matters of subjective judgement undertaken by the professional valuer based upon his or her expertise and experience   The fact that there may be matters of subjective analysis undertaken is encompassed and envisaged by the Determination which relies upon a professional valuer undertaking the task and coming to a valuation  However  in reaching the final valuation  the professional valuer must not deviate from the method of valuation dictated by the terms of the Determination  In this proceeding  the hypothetical development method of valuation was in fact adopted  and was the appropriate method as required by the Determination  To the extent that there are judgement calls to be made within the application of that method  then this would be a matter for the valuer s professional expertise upon which minds may differ in arriving at a particular value citedRiver Bank Pty Ltd v Commonwealth     ALJR   Undoubtedly  the  conventional valuation technique  is the use of comparable sales evidence to determine market value  see River Bank Pty Ltd v Commonwealth     ALJR       per Stephen J   However  this may not be an appropriate method of valuation in any given case  Certainly it was not the valuation technique adopted  nor to be adopted  for the purpose of the valuation the subject of this proceeding citedRondo v R   NSWCCA         A Crim R  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCCA  html  In view of the above reasons  I have not needed to address whether the cumulative effect of each failure to comply with the Determination could lead to a conclusion of invalidity  rather than taking each failure to comply in isolation  In any given case  this issue may arise  see  eg  Rondo
