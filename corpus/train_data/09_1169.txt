FCA   at    referred toLewis v Doran   NSWSC         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  htmlThere is some authority relating to the construction of the generally similar provision in s  A of the Corporations Act    Cth   That section defines solvency as requiring that  the person is able to pay all the person s debts  as and when they become due and payable   Like s  a  of the Act  the provision does not include the words  from his or her own money   In Lewis v Doran   NSWSC         ALR     Palmer J in the Supreme Court of New South Wales concluded that the omission of those words from s  A  leaves the Court free to determine insolvency  whether retrospective or prospective  as a question of commercial reality having regard to the particular facts of the case   at    The New South Wales Court of Appeal affirmed his Honour s decision   Lewis  as liq of Doran Constructions Pty Ltd  in liq  v Doran   NSWCA         ALR   and did not express disagreement with his exposition of the relevant legal principles  Giles JA  with whom Hodgson and McColl JJA agreed  suggested at   that  there is no compelling reason to exclude from consideration funds which can be gained from borrowings secured on assets of third parties  or even unsecured borrowings  provided that the company is capable of repaying this loan as and when it falls due  Giles JA noted  at   that even before the introduction of this wording of s  A  in a number of decisions courts had been prepared to pay regard to the ability to obtain unsecured borrowings followedMonk v Australia and New

austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlCounsel for ICM referred me to Totev v Sfar   FCA         ALR   at         Totev   where Allsop J  when a judge of this Court  discussed  inter alia  the matters that a debtor must prove in order to establish  other sufficient cause  within s  b  of the Bankruptcy Act   An appeal relating to that decision  Totev v Sfar   FCAFC         FCR     is not of present relevance  Importantly  counsel submitted that I could not be satisfied that the claim made by Mr Young in the   DC Proceeding was likely to be determined at any time in the near future  The fact was that Mr Young wished to file a significantly amended pleading in the   DC Proceeding and counsel for ICM said that this would prompt a request for particulars  His submission was that allowing for amendment of the pleadings  the supply of particulars  a revised discovery in the light of amended pleadings  and preparation for trial  the   DC Proceeding  assuming against ICM that it would succeed  could not be regarded as being likely to yield funds for the payment of Mr Young s creditors in anything like the near future so to overcome his present insolvency  Time did not permit the hearing to be concluded on   July   and the proceeding was stood over to     pm on Wednesday   July    There was a dramatic change at the resumed hearing on   July    Mr J T Svehla of counsel had come to represent Mr Young  without any instructing solicitor   He applied for an adjournment  Mr Svehla said that he had come into the matter only recently and that he wished to achieve the following steps in the interests of Mr Young  both in the Federal Court and elsewhere In order to establish  other sufficient cause   or  of course  ability to pay debts  Mr Young must establish that his claim against ICM is likely to succeed  not merely that he has an arguable claim  see the numerous cases listed in McQuade and Gronow  McDonald Henry and Meek s Australian Bankruptcy Law and Practice   th ed  Thomson Lawbook Co  as at   October   at       esp Totev at       The test is more stringent and demanding than that which applies under s   of the Bankruptcy Act   which relates to the extension of time for compliance with a bankruptcy notice where a debtor has applied for an order setting aside that notice on the ground that the debtor has a counter claim  set off or cross demand of the kind referred to in s  g  of that Act  As Allsop J observed in Totev at   the context is different under s  b   The authorities referred to by his Honour show that the debtor s claim against the petitioning creditor must be one which is  likely to succeed   For the reasons below and in the Earlier Reasons for Judgment  I am not satisfied that Mr Young s claim is likely to succeed  The terms of the assignment of   December   were previously noted  In my Earlier Reasons for Judgment I held that assignment invalid for the reasons there set out  I will not summarise those reasons beyond saying that I held the purported assignment to be of a bare cause of action which the parties accepted could be sustained only if Mr Young had a  genuine commercial interest  in taking the assignment and enforcing it for his own benefit  at    AAC and Mr Young have recently entered into the three deeds of assignment referred to below apparently in an attempt to overcome the problem referred to  Mr Young now seeks to support the assignment of the causes of action as being ancillary to and supportive of an assignment of property as well as on the  genuine commercial interest  ground  The three deeds were executed after the First Sequestration Proceeding was commenced by ICM on   March   and after this present sequestration proceeding was commenced by ICM on   June   citedTrendtex Trading

     NZLR    Assuming in favour of Mr Young that the assignments could be saved by Mr Young s having had a genuine commercial interest in taking them  see Trendtex   they would not be saved  Mr Young became the sole shareholder of AAC on   June    He did not have a genuine commercial interest as at   December    see the Earlier Reasons for Judgment at     and the mere fact without more that he was a one hundred percent shareholder in AAC at the time of the subsequent purported assignments on   June    July and   July   does not support those purported assignments  The question to be asked is  what genuine commercial interest did Mr Young have at the time of any assignment being considered that would be served by that assignment  It is not as if the assignment was necessary in order that the claimed cause of action against ICM be enforced and Mr Young s interest as shareholder be safeguarded  As sole shareholder  director and controlling mind of AAC  Mr Young was in a position to
