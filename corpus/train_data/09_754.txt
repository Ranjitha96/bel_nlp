Australian Communications and Media Authority v Radio  UE Sydney Pty Ltd  No     FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredAmalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden     NSWLR  The spoken word is the vehicle used to shape views on radio current affairs programs  The identity of the speaker  if known to the audience  can itself influence their receptivity to what he or she says  as can the speaker s oratorical style and manner of delivery  And  because of its orality  publication in a radio broadcast conveys a transient message  The listener may tune in or turn on the radio part way through a program  he or she may have missed an earlier disclosure announcement by the presenter when he or she returns to a topic that attracts an obligation to make such an announcement  If it is not made  that new listener will not be aware of what the disclosure standard  and the licence  require be conveyed contemporaneously  namely the presenter s sponsorship  Additionally  listeners may not always be attentive to what is being broadcast on radio and may miss the significance  or indeed the occurrence  of an earlier disclosure statement in the same program  That can affect the meaning which the listener understands to have been conveyed by what he or she hears the presenter saying later  These characteristics of transient communications  such as radio or television broadcasts  are also recognised in the common law principles of defamation  Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd v Marsden     NSWLR   at  G  E per Hunt CJ at CL  Mason P and Handley JA agreeing  Thus  the transience both of what is spoken on air during a radio broadcast and of the listening audience  who may tune in or out at any time and  when tuned in  may pay closer or lesser degrees of attention  underlie the policy behind the disclosure standard s insistence on the presenter making a disclosure announcement contemporaneously each time one of his or her sponsor s name  products or service is mentioned  The liability in s  A  corresponds to  but is distinct from the criminal liability imposed by s    The conduct proscribed by each section is the same  namely a breach of a condition of a licence set out in cl   of Sch   including a breach of the disclosure standard  But the objects of the two sections are not the same  One object of s  A  is to create a civil  not criminal  liability so as to enable the Authority to secure compliance with important provisions in the Act more readily than through criminal proceedings  But another object of the section is to reinforce the norm of conduct for licensees in s   and to provide a means to enforce their compliance with it less drastic than the remedies existing before   citedAustralian Capital Television Pty

failed to do to comply with the disclosure standard  This is because Mr Laws was acting as the licensee when using its licence to broadcast his program  Mason CJ  Wilson and Toohey JJ said of a provision similar to s  A  in Hamilton   CLR at   that it         speaks directly to the company  It is not a case of a company being made liable for an act performed by a servant of the company on its behalf  The liability imposed is direct  not vicarious  The distinction was drawn by Viscount Haldane LC in Lennard s Carrying Co Ltd v Asiatic Petroleum Co Ltd   AC   at p    Its significance is explained by Lord Reid in Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass   AC   at p      I must start by considering the nature of the personality which by a fiction the law attributes to a corporation  A living person has a mind which can have knowledge or intention or be negligent and he has hands to carry out his intentions  A corporation has none of these  it must act through living persons  though not always one or the same person  Then the person who acts is not speaking or acting for the company  He is acting as the company and his mind which directs his acts is the mind of the company   There is no question of the company being vicariously liable  He is not acting as a servant  representative  agent or delegate  He is an embodiment of the company or  one could say  he hears and speaks through the persona of the company   within his appropriate sphere  and his mind is the mind of the company  If it is a guilty mind then that guilt is the guilt of the company  It must be a question of law whether  once the facts have been ascertained  a person in doing particular things is to be regarded as the company or merely as the company s servant or agent  In that case any liability of the company can only be a statutory or vicarious liability         See also the statement of Denning LJ in H L Bolton  Engineering  Co Ltd v T J Graham   Sons Ltd     QB   at p        There can be no doubt  on the facts of the present case  that the respondent  in placing the advertisement and in dealing with those who replied to it  was the company  He was its managing director and his mind was the mind of the company  The company therefore was liable as a principal for the breaches of s   of the Code  The liability was direct  not vicarious    emphasis added appliedL Vogel   Sons Pty Ltd v

court must give careful attention to the maximum provided for in the Act  The maximum invites comparison between the worst possible case and the case before the Court  And the maximum can provide a yardstick when balanced with the other relevant factors  Markarian   CLR at        In this respect  ordinarily the worst possible case for a civil penalty would not be equivalent to the worst possible case for a criminal penalty under the corresponding section in the Act  That is because  first  the purpose of the Parliament providing for the civil penalty was to enable the Authority to use that power to address conduct not warranting the use of the corresponding criminal provision or the suspension or cancellation of a licence  Secondly  if a person has been convicted of an offence  e g  under s   constituted by substantially the same conduct as attracts a civil penalty  e g  under s  A  then s  L prohibits the Court making a civil penalty order against that person  And  s  M stays civil penalty proceedings if criminal proceedings have been or are later commenced in respect of substantially the same conduct  If the person is convicted  then s  M  provides for the civil penalty proceedings to be dismissed  but the stay is lifted if the person is acquitted  Conversely  s  N authorises criminal proceedings to be commenced in the opposite situation  i e  after a civil penalty order has been made  This preserves the option of later prosecution where  for example further evidence has come to light showing that a more severe penalty is called for than that in the civil penalty order  There is a prosecutorial discretion to bring criminal proceedings under s  N  Ordinarily  some enlivening factor must arise after the conclusion of the civil penalty order proceedings to warrant the initiation of the criminal proceedings so that they would not be seen as an abuse of process in light of the policy in ss  L and  M  e g  if facts subsequently were discovered  casting

Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCA         FCR   at  G  C  where Burchett and Kiefel JJ said     Because the fixing of the quantum of a penalty cannot be an exact science  the Court  in such a case  does not ask whether it would without the aid of the parties have arrived at the precise figure they have proposed  but rather whether their proposal can be accepted as fixing an appropriate amount      There is an important public policy involved  When corporations acknowledge contraventions  very lengthy and complex litigation is frequently avoided  freeing the courts to deal with other matters  and investigating officers of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to turn to other areas of the economy that await their attention  At the same time  a negotiated resolution in the instant case may be expected to include measures designed to promote  for the future  vigorous competition in the particular market concerned  These beneficial consequences would be jeopardised if corporations were to conclude that proper settlements were clouded by unpredictable risks  A proper figure is one within the permissible range in all the circumstances  The Court will not depart from an agreed figure merely because it might otherwise have been disposed to select some other figure  or except in a clear case  Their Honours emphasised that the Court in such cases recognised that the selection of a penalty is not an exact science and that  as in the formation of other discretionary judgments  there will usually be a range of penalties that could be appropriate  Generally  the Court does not undertake the exercise of fixing a penalty itself to assess whether it is prepared to give effect to the parties  suggestion  NW Foods   FCR at  B G  The assessment of a pecuniary penalty that is appropriate  having regard to all relevant factors under s  F  is  like a criminal sentence  the result of the  process of instinctive synthesis  described in Markarian   CLR at         and Wong v The Queen   HCA         CLR   at           per Gaudron  Gummow and Hayne  If what is suggested by the parties as an appropriate penalty is unreasonable or plainly unjust  the court can reject it on similar principles to those used when sentences are either manifestly excessive or inadequate  cf Markarian   CLR at       Lukatela v Birch     FLR   at        In Minister for Industry Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd   ATPR p    at     Branson  Sackville and Gyles JJ said     Just as the criminal court will take into account the prosecution s views on the appropriate sentence  so the court in the civil penalty case  as NW Frozen Foods explained  will take account of the regulator s position  But in neither case is the court relieved from the responsibility of exercising its own judgment as to the appropriate sentence  in criminal cases  or whether the proposed penalty is within the appropriate range for the contravention  in civil penalty cases   In each case  the Court should be satisfied that it is being given accurate  reliable and complete information on critical questions  In Australian Competition and Consumer Commissioner v Qantas Airways Ltd     ALR   at         Lindgren J identified   propositions relating to the fixing of penalties under the Trade Practices Act as flowing from the decisions in NW Foods   FCA       FCR   and Mobil   ATPR p     and these were recently applied by Jacobson J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v PRK Corporation Pty Ltd   FCA   at          These included the propositions that  the Court is not obliged to commence its reasoning with the level of the agreed penalty and limit itself to considering whether that penalty is within the range  the Court is entitled to address the question independently at the outset of its reasoning  the admissions and agreed facts should not be approached as if they had been  tailored or modified to reflect the difficulties faced by the  regulator  in proving its case  the regulator should always explain to the Court the process of reasoning said to justify a discounted penalty citedProject Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlWhere ss  L or  M apply  the apparent intention of the Parliament  was to exclude the use of the civil penalty order if criminal proceedings result in conviction  This is because the stamp or  possibility  of the conviction has characterised the contravention  even if only temporarily so  pending the determination of the criminal proceedings  as of a more serious kind  No doubt the civil penalty imposed would be relevant to the criminal penalty following conviction  where s  N applies  But  s  N must be read harmoniously with the legislative policy reflected in ss  L and  M  Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR   at           per McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ  The Parliament conferred power on the Court to impose and to determine the amount of any pecuniary penalty  s  F     For many years the Court has recognised the ability of parties to such proceedings to make a joint or agreed submission as to the civil penalties to be imposed for contraventions of legislation  Agreement as to the suggested result can be reached prior to the institution of the proceedings for civil penalties  as happened here  Ordinarily  there will be savings in time and public and private expense that can be expected from parties putting forward  in a responsible manner  as they have in these proceedings  agreed contraventions and suggested penalties  The Court may reject the suggested penalty  and impose a different one  But  in the ordinary case the use of this sensible approach will result in a speedy determination of the proceedings  Such a consequence is obviously of considerable benefit to the community  a lengthy and expensive trial and possibly an appeal or appeals are averted and a just penalty is imposed  But there is another  very important benefit in the approach  it gives the wrongdoer a degree of certainty and a speedy imposition of the penalty  Where a result is uncertain  such as the outcome of a contested trial and the consequent penalty  whether a criminal sentence or the imposition of a civil penalty  it is all too human for a wrongdoer to procrastinate in the hope that something will work out favourably  But if a wrongdoer  such as a person who contravenes a civil penalty provision in legislation  can have relative assurance that  however severe  an agreed penalty is likely to be imposed promptly  that degree of certainty is a powerful spur to action

imprisonment using the method preferred in Mill   CLR at    The High Court suggested its preference for making sentences wholly or partially concurrent  where practicable  to reflect the appropriate

discussed the principle  Concurrent pecuniary penalties cannot be imposed  So the Court must consider the overall burden imposed by the set of pecuniary penalties to assess whether  in totality  the

cases cth HCA  htmlThe chairman of the Authority  Chris Chapman  explained its reasons for commencing these proceedings in a media release  Radio  UE relied on the media release  its dissemination and its terms as evidence of harm to Radio  UE s reputation in respect of compliance and of its public denunciation in respect of the   contraventions  cf Ryan v The Queen   HCA         CLR   at           per McHugh J        per Kirby J        per Callinan J   Mr Chapman said     ACMA has taken the step of applying for civil penalty orders against  UE  having earlier tried to address  UE s compliance failures through other means  These latest breaches occurred at a time when  UE had given ACMA an enforceable undertaking to improve its performance  particularly in relation to the John Laws Morning Show         However  ACMA  and the Australian Broadcasting Authority before it  has emphasised in previous findings against  UE that the obligation to comply with program standards lies with the licensee itself  in fact it goes to the heart of a licensee s obligations       Broadcasting licences are not given out lightly by government and convey significant benefit to those to whom a licence is granted   It is a licensee s unrelenting responsibility to manage its business  including its presenters and production staff  so as to ensure satisfactory compliance with the regulatory requirements      Company management put at real risk the retention of these licences when they allow on air personalities or other staff to breach the rules  One consideration informing the Authority s agreement to consenting to the civil penalty order was its assessment that Fairfax genuinely accepts that proposition    emphasis added The grant of the licence is a privilege to use the public resource of the radio spectrum  Abuse of the privilege  by breaching a condition of a licence  attracts liability under ss   and  A   The primary purpose of s  A  is to protect the public by holding licensees to the standard of conduct that their licence requires them to observe  The disclosure standard addresses a particular  and insidious  means of abusing the privilege of a commercial radio broadcasting licence  That standard recognised the significant degree of influence current affairs presenters could exert in shaping community views in Australia  see s    The more prominent the

under s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and s  Y of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth   They relied on what Flick J had said in Secretary  Department of Health and Aging v Pagasa Australia Pty Ltd   FCA   at          He helpfully reviewed a large number of cases imposing civil penalties arising under a number of Acts  Pagasa   FCA   at         concluding at      Although the form of words set forth in other legislative provisions may be the same or comparable to those employed in the   Act  the legislative mandate that the Court   must have regard to all relevant matters   in s  Y  assumes obvious importance  It is that mandate which directs attention to those more specific matters which can only be discerned from an analysis of the   Act itself  Of central importance in identifying those matters which are   relevant     and which must therefore be taken into account   are the objects and purposes of the   Act  I agree with Flick J s approach to the construction of provisions like s  F  of the Act  French J remarked in CSR   ATPR p    at   the other general objects of the criminal law apart from deterrence  namely retribution and rehabilitation  had no      part to play in

licensee by requiring it not to breach a condition of its licence set out in cl   of Sch   to the Act  That liability is not a vicarious liability imposed on Radio  UE for the conduct of its presenters  but a direct liability on it  Hamilton v Whitehead   HCA         CLR   at      There  Mason CJ  Wilson and Toohey JJ held that when an employee acted in the course of his or her employment he or she did so as the embodiment of the corporate employer  Hamilton   CLR at   Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass   UKHL       AC   at   per Lord Reid  Under s  A  a corporation will incur liability for what its agent  Mr Laws  did or failed to do to comply with the disclosure standard  This is because Mr Laws was acting as the licensee when using its licence to broadcast his program  Mason CJ  Wilson and Toohey JJ said of a provision similar to s  A  in Hamilton   CLR at   that it         speaks directly to the company  It is not a case of a company being made liable for an act performed by a servant of the company on its behalf  The liability imposed is direct  not vicarious  The distinction was drawn by Viscount Haldane LC in Lennard s Carrying Co Ltd v Asiatic Petroleum Co Ltd   AC   at p    Its significance is explained by Lord Reid in Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass   AC   at p      I must start by considering the nature of the personality which by a fiction the law attributes to a corporation  A living person has a mind which can have knowledge or intention or be negligent and he has hands to carry out his intentions  A corporation has none of these  it must act through living persons  though not always one or the same person  Then the person who acts is not speaking or acting for the company  He is acting as the company and his mind which directs his acts is the mind of the company   There is no question of the company being vicariously liable  He is not acting as a servant  representative  agent or delegate  He is an embodiment of the company or  one could say  he hears and speaks through the persona of the company   within his appropriate sphere  and his mind is the mind of the company  If it is a guilty mind then that guilt is the guilt of the company  It must be a question of law whether  once the facts have been ascertained  a person in doing particular things is to be regarded as the company or merely as the company s servant or agent  In that case any liability of the company can only be a statutory or vicarious liability         See also the statement of Denning LJ in H L Bolton  Engineering  Co Ltd v T J Graham   Sons Ltd     QB   at p        There can be no doubt  on the facts of the present case  that the respondent  in placing the advertisement and in dealing with those who replied to it  was the company  He was its managing director and his mind was the mind of the company  The company therefore was liable as a principal for the breaches of s   of the Code  The liability was direct  not vicarious    emphasis added distinguishedappliedTrade Practices Commission v CSR Limited   ATPR p   A primary purpose of civil penalties is deterrence  Trade Practices Commission v CSR Limited   ATPR p    at   per French J  Hence  in assessing the penalty to be imposed  a court will consider whether  in all the circumstances relevant to be taken into account  here under s  F  others would be deterred by the penalty and at the same time the licensee will be penalised or punished appropriately  The range of relevant matters under s  F  ordinarily will include  borrowing from what French J suggested in CSR   ATPR p    at    I agree with Flick J s approach to the construction of provisions like s  F  of the Act  French J remarked in CSR   ATPR p    at   the other general objects of the criminal law apart from deterrence  namely retribution and rehabilitation  had no      part to play in economic regulation of the kind contemplated by Pt IV  of the Trade Practices Act   The pecuniary penalties must put a price on the contraventions that is sufficiently high to deter repetition by Radio  UE as the contravenor and by others who might be tempted to contravene the Act and the disclosure standard  see CSR   ATPR p    at   per French J  I am of opinion that there will be a substantial deterrent effect given to licensees by the penalties I will impose  The kind of contraventions that Mr Laws caused Radio  UE to make and its inadequate attention to the requirements of compliance must be deterred if the purpose of the disclosure standard is to be upheld  I am satisfied that there will not be a repetition of Mr Laws  conduct only because he has retired from presenting his program on Radio  UE  Radio  UE has not had to deal with or test whether Mr Laws would now comply under its new measures  However  I am also satisfied that Radio  UE has implemented genuine and satisfactory changes to its compliance systems that are likely to lead to compliance by its other presenters  And  I am also satisfied that no bad faith was involved on the part of Radio  UE s management or Mr Mott  Licensees must be deterred from taking lackadaisical attitudes to compliance with their statutory and licence obligations  Takeovers and changes of control in ownership occur on a fairly regular basis in the broadcasting industry  Such events are not an excuse for a licensee to fail to comply with the Act  the disclosure standard or its licence  If Mr Mott and all the senior management were too busy to protect the very basis which generated Radio  UE s entitlement to earn income  namely its licence  then a clear message must be sent by condign penalisation of that attitude  Such an attitude is unacceptable  It demonstrates an inattention to the public trust in commercial radio broadcasting licensees

punish Radio  UE by imposing a heavier penalty for the   contraventions because of its further breaches of the enforceable undertaking  The circumstances in which those further breaches occurred are nonetheless relevant  in accordance with s  F  of the Act  for the purpose of assessing the conduct of Radio  UE  because of their contemporaneity and interrelation with the   contraventions and the extent to which they went unremedied  cf Weininger v The Queen   HCA         CLR   at     per Gleeson CJ  McHugh  Gummow and Hayne JJ     Alternative enforcement options The Centre identified other enforcement powers that were available to the Authority  which it had not sought to use in this matter  It relied on the context of the Parliament s decision to expand the potential remedies available to the Authority  Under s   the Authority was given power  by notice in writing  to suspend a licence for such period  not exceeding three months as was specified in the licence or to cancel the licence where a commercial radio broadcasting licensee breached a condition of the licence  In addition  s  X provided the Authority with power to apply to the Court  where a person had given an enforceable undertaking under s  W that the Authority considered had been breached  for orders that included any order that the Court thought appropriate  s  X d   The Centre argued  that accordingly  the Authority had formed the view that it would proceed with the less drastic remedy of seeking pecuniary penalties under s  F and declaratory relief  The Authority and Radio  UE both argued that the availability of other sanctions was not relevant to the quantum of a civil penalty to be imposed and that Radio  UE should not be penalised more severely because of the existence of other enforcement remedies which the Authority chose not to employ  I accept that submission     Deterrence A licensee cannot assume that nothing will go wrong  Far less could Radio  UE have assumed this with Mr Laws who  after all  had been the cause of giving the enforceable undertaking  Radio  UE had a duty to be vigilant to ensure compliance with its licence  the disclosure standard and the Act  Instead  Radio  UE committed the contraventions when it permitted Mr Laws to use its licence knowing that  first  Mr Laws had a history of previous contraventions of the disclosure standard  cp Weininger   CLR at     per Gleeson CJ  McHugh  Gummow and Hayne JJ  secondly  he had an antipathy to the disclosure standard  thirdly  he had six very substantial commercial agreements and  fourthly  he made frequent references during his program to his sponsors  their products and services  But for Radio  UE s mitigating conduct  I would have imposed higher penalties for these serious breaches  Rather than making declarations  I consider that it is appropriate to state each contravention and the pecuniary penalty I have imposed for it in the formal orders  The Authority  licensees and the public will be able to relate the two together in that way  In my opinion  these contraventions should be marked with severe and substantial pecuniary penalties  The agreed penalties are  overall  but with the three exceptions I have noted  manifestly inadequate  indeed  negligible  To be sure  the Parliament intended that ss  A and  F would be a means of dealing with contraventions not calling for more severe
