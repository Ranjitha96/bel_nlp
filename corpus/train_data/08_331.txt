Karsten v Federal Republic of Germany   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedBertran v Vanstone   FCA       ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The statutory expression   in force   is to be construed as requiring consideration simply to be given to   whether a person had been accused of a criminal offence and whether that accusation had led to the initiation of criminal proceedings   Bertran v Vanstone   FCA   at       FCA       ALR     For the purposes of the Motion  any challenge to the manner in which the Minister exercised the power conferred by s   on this basis has no reasonable prospects of success   Moreover  such further evidence as is now before the Court on the present Motion seems to amply support a finding that the warrant remains in force and that there is no reason to question that conclusion  even now  Thus  an   Opinion   dated   April   as subsequently provided under the signature of the Senior Chief Public Prosecutor for the Hannover Department of Public Prosecutions  states in part as follows         The detention order by the Regional Court of Hannover dated September     was generated in the manner provided by law and fulfils the rules of the StPO  German Code of Criminal Procedure  under formal aspects as well   The allegation of the prosecuted person that the detention order had expired in December   is not true  According to StPO  an order for detention awaiting trial shall only become invalid  when it is lifted by a court     That Opinion stands in contrast to an affidavit filed in proceedings in the Australian Capital Territory by Mr Karsten  being an annexure to an Affidavit filed in the present proceedings in this Court  that asserts        The warrant provided with the extradition request expired in December   according to my sources      No further details were provided nor were the   sources   identified  For present purposes  it is considered that no conclusion is open other than that the warrant remains   in force    Further written submissions filed on   March   by Mr Karsten seek to annex further materials  Some of these materials are in German and have not been translated into English  To the extent that the Court has been able to consider those materials  the conclusion remains the same consideredBrock v Minister for Justice   Customs   FCA  http

review may constitute an abuse of process  Rivera v Minister Administering the Extradition Act    Cth    FCAFC   at     per Rares J    FCAFC       ALD    See also Brock v Minister for Justice   Customs   FCA    In the present proceedings  it is considered an abuse of process for the Applicant to now again seek to agitate the validity of the order made under s   and to thereby attempt to vitiate the subsequent s   determination consideredBrock v United States of America   FCAFC       FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Whether or not either of these two fields of inquiry can be properly characterised as   jurisdictional facts   thus need not be resolved  The resolution of whether a fact is jurisdictional or not remains a matter of statutory construction  Timbarra Protection Coalition Inc v Ross Mining NL   NSWCA   at       NSWLR   at   per Spigelman CJ  Mason P and Meagher JA agreeing   Less difficulty may be experienced in characterising as a   jurisdictional fact   a question as to whether a person has informed a magistrate of his consent  greater difficulty  however  may be experienced in characterising as   jurisdictional   whether a magistrate had   reason to believe that the consent was not given voluntarily    The potential inconvenience consequent upon construing s   in such a manner may be a telling reason to conclude that such matters are not   jurisdictional   cf Brock v United States of America   FCAFC   at   per Black CJ    FCAFC       FCR   followedBuck v Bavone   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Section  a  it will be noted  confers power by reference to whether the Attorney General forms an   opinion   and s   refers to the Attorney General being   satisfied   of the matters there specified  On behalf of the Respondent Minister  reference was made to the confined ambit of judicial review available where powers are so conferred  Buck v Bavone   HCA         CLR    Gibbs J there observed at         It is not uncommon for statutes to provide that a board or other authority shall or may take certain action if it is satisfied of the existence of certain matters specified in the statute  Whether the decision of the authority under such a statute can be effectively reviewed by the courts will often largely depend on the nature of the matters of which the authority is required to be satisfied  In all such cases the authority must act in good faith  it cannot act merely arbitrarily or capriciously  Moreover  a person affected will obtain relief from the courts if he can show that the authority has misdirected itself in law or that it has failed to consider matters that it was required to consider or has taken irrelevant matters into account  Even if none of these things can be established  the courts will interfere if the decision reached by the authority appears so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could properly have arrived at it  However  where the matter of which the authority is required to be satisfied is a matter of opinion or policy or taste it may be very difficult to show that it has erred in one of these ways  or that its decision could not reasonably have been reached  In such cases the authority will be left with a very wide discretion which cannot be effectively reviewed by the courts   In the present extradition process  an issue which assumes significance was the making of an order under s    That section provides as follows    Consent to surrender     Where     a  a person is on remand under section   and    b  the Attorney General has given a notice under subsection   in relation to the person    the person may inform a magistrate that the person consents to being surrendered to the extradition country concerned in relation to the extradition offence  or all of the extradition offences  for which surrender of the person is sought by that country      Where the person informs the magistrate that he or she so consents  the magistrate shall  unless the magistrate has reason to believe that the consent was not given voluntarily     a  advise the person that the effect of so consenting will be that         i  the person will be committed to prison without any proceedings being conducted under section   to determine whether the person is eligible for surrender in relation to any extradition offence  and    ii  the person will  if the Attorney General issues a surrender warrant or a temporary surrender warrant  be surrendered to the extradition country  and        b  if  after the person has been advised as mentioned in paragraph  a  the person again consents to being surrendered         i  by warrant in the statutory form  order that the person be committed to prison to await surrender under a surrender warrant or temporary surrender warrant or release pursuant to an order under subsection   and    ii  advise the Attorney General in writing of the offence or the offences in respect of which the person has so consented   It is difficult to conclude that the Applicant does not fall within the terms of s  a i  of the Extradition Act   namely a person in respect of whom there is   a warrant     in force     in relation to an offence     against the law   of Germany   The warrant as issued does not on its face disclose any limitation as to the period of time during which it is to operate  The manner of operation of a warrant issued under a foreign law  including any limitation as to the period of time during which it is to operate  is a question of fact  As contended by the Respondent Minister  the existence of the warrant and the absence of any limitation upon its face provided a sound basis upon which the Respondent Minister could lawfully form an   opinion   for the purposes of s   cf Buck v Bavone   Moreover  the request for extradition  being a document also before the Minister when giving the notice  also proceeds upon the assumption that the warrant issued in September   remained in force when the request was being made in April     As at the date when the s   notice was given  the material then available provided a sound basis for the requisite   opinion   being formed  A discrete submission advanced on behalf of the Respondent Minister again focused attention upon the confined ambit of such judicial review as is available  Buck v Bavone   Section  a ii     as with s  a i     again vests the decision making function in the Attorney  or the Minister  if he is   of the opinion   that the person involved has committed an   extradition offence    That submission is again accepted   A contrary conclusion advanced by Mr Karsten was based upon what was said to be a discrepancy between what the German Criminal Code may have provided in terms  and the sentences in fact imposed upon others involved in the events giving rise to the charges against him  That   parity of sentencing   as urged by Mr Karsten dictated a different conclusion  It is considered that the   opinion   formed on   October   was one open to be reached by the Minister on the materials before him and one which should be accepted for the purposes of the present Motion    Albeit subsequent to the point in time when the s   notice was issued on   October   it may further be noted that there was no later reason to revisit that conclusion  The   Opinion   provided in April   thus also states in part as follows          German police officers are not authorised to make offers to terminate criminal procedures   Additionally  execution of imprisonment may  under Section   StPO  only be suspended on probation  when it does not exceed   years  In the case concerned here however  the minimum punishment provided by law is   years of imprisonment  One could only go below this when other circumstances  which are regulated by law  come up  Such specific circumstances are not recognisable  however  For this reason  probationary suspension of the imprisonment to be imposed when a sentence is passed would  at the current state of knowledge  not be possible    consideredCabal v United Mexican States  No     FCA       ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth

construction and effect of s  A of the Federal Court of Australia Act were exhaustively reviewed by Rares J in Boston Commercial Services Pty Ltd v GE Capital Finance Australasia Pty Ltd   FCA   at      His Honour stated the relevant principles at   and they may be summarised as follows    In assessing whether there are reasonable prospects of success  the Court must be cautious not to do an injustice by summary dismissal     There will be reasonable prospects of success if there is evidence which may be reasonably believed so as to enable the party against whom summary judgment is sought to succeed at the final hearing     Evidence of an ambivalent character will usually be sufficient to amount to reasonable prospects     Unless only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable  the discretion under s  A cannot be enlivened   In the present proceedings it is recognised that  when resolving the Minister s Motion   it is not necessary to conclude that Mr Karsten s case is either   hopeless   or   bound to fail    It is  however  considered that it has   no reasonable prospect  s  of success    It is considered that Mr Karsten has no reasonable prospects of any conclusion being reached other than that   a  he is an   extraditable person   within the meaning of ss   and   of the Extradition Act      b  the offence in respect of which his extradition is sought is an

to again impose a requirement upon the Attorney General or the Minister to inquire into the penalty likely to be imposed is an approach which should be rejected  The definition of   extradition offence   it has been said  is   not concerned with whether there are other alternate and lesser possible penalties  nor with the actual penalty likely to be imposed on the person whose extradition is being sought   Dutton v O Shane   FCAFC   at       FCAFC       FCR   at   per Finn and Dowsett JJ   It is thus considered that there is no doubt that the offence for which extradition has been sought

opinion     It is understood that the Applicant s contention in respect of the determination made under s   is that he was not an   eligible person   because   the applicant was not the subject of a

Intervening  namely in February   was the decision of Connolly J of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory  R v Karsten   ACTSC       FLR    In those proceedings Mr Karsten sought to challenge the decision of the magistrate  Justice Connolly entertained a Notice of Appeal against the decision of the magistrate  Relevant to the order made by the magistrate are the following observations of his Honour        The Extradition Act   of the Commonwealth provides two routes by which the question of whether surrender will occur may proceed  By s   a person who has been remanded  may consent to their surrender  The matter is then laid before the Commonwealth Attorney General for determination as to whether surrender will  in fact  occur  Or  pursuant to s   there may be a contested hearing in relation to whether there is eligibility to surrender     The common factual ground here is that Mr Karsten indicated his consent to being extradited and  as I understand it  there is no dispute that the learned Magistrate went through the necessary steps under s   which requires a magistrate  unless they have reason to believe the consent was not voluntary  to advise the person of the effect and consequences of their determination to surrender  There is no specific provision in the Act relating to a variation of that determination   His Honour s reasons for decision record the submission made through the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions that the Supreme Court had          no general jurisdiction     to entertain firstly an appeal from a s   decision  and specifically no jurisdiction to permit a variation in the form of consent that was on the papers at least given at that hearing   The question before Connolly J was formulated by his Honour as being   whether or not this Court has the jurisdiction to entertain an application to allow Mr Karsten to withdraw his consent to an extradition     ACTSC   at     That question was answered in the negative  His Honour did  however  go on to further observe        There is a general discretion in the Attorney in relation to the extradition process  and it seems to me that the question of the voluntariness of consent would be a question that the Attorney would need to satisfy himself of  Clearly  if a situation was one where a person had no English skills at all  or had been tricked in some way into agreeing to consent  that would be a matter that would necessarily attract attention and the Attorney and  sic  would need to make a determination to that effect   Before the Supreme Court Mr Karsten was legally represented  A more general submission advanced on the hearing of the present Motion before this Court that Mr Karsten was thereafter represented by counsel  it is considered  should not be accepted  What advice was given to Mr Karsten by his then legal representative when appearing in the Supreme Court remains  not surprisingly  unknown   Relevantly  however  by the time the s   determination was made  the only judicial challenge to the s   decision had been heard and resolved against Mr Karsten  In such circumstances it is considered that the requirements of s   had been met  namely that there was a lawful   order of a magistrate made under section     and that any condition precedent to the exercise of the power conferred by s   had been satisfied   Even if the construction of s   which has been given to that section be incorrect  it is considered that it would be an abuse of process to now permit the Applicant to advance such a contention  It would be an abuse of the process of the Court for a person the subject of extradition proceedings to seek to challenge an order made pursuant to s   to be informed that the means of challenge then being invoked were not available to him  to thereafter await a determination made under s   and  when that determination is adverse  to be permitted to then revert to his earlier position by asserting that there was no power to make the s   determination followedRivera v Minister Administering the Extradition Act    Cth    FCAFC       ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The Further Amended Application seeks to challenge a notice issued under s   of the Extradition Act    Cth  on   October   and a determination that the Applicant be surrendered pursuant to s   of that Act  The Applicant contends that for the purposes of the Act that     i  he is not an   extraditable person   within ss   and        ii  the offence in respect of which extradition is sought is not an   extradition offence   within ss   and     and    iii  he is not an   eligible person   within s       These contentions  if made out  are said to constitute jurisdictional error on the part of the Respondent Minister   On   February   a Further Amended Notice of Motion was filed on behalf of the Respondent Minister seeking the dismissal of the Further Amended Application   It is that Motion which is presently before the Court   It is considered that each of the Applicant s contentions should be rejected and that the orders as sought in the Respondent Minister s Motion should be made   A warrant under s   was thereafter issued on   December   by Magistrate Madden  a magistrate of the Australian Capital Territory  On the same day a letter was forwarded by the Magistrate to the then Attorney General  the Honourable Phillip Ruddock  identifying the Applicant and stating   As required by s  b ii  of the Extradition Act   I advise that on   December   the abovenamed consented to being surrendered to the Federal Republic of Germany in relation to the following offence     attempted incitement to commit murder contrary to sections   and   of the German Criminal Code   count     I enclose a copy of the warrant under subsection  b i  that I signed today   On   July   the Applicant was advised that the Minister had determined under s   that the Applicant was to be surrendered to Germany and that a warrant had been issued for his surrender   Repetitious challenges to decisions made under the Extradition Act    Cth  or a failure to raise for resolution issues relevant to a decision the subject of review may constitute an abuse of process  Rivera v Minister Administering the Extradition Act    Cth    FCAFC   at     per Rares J    FCAFC       ALD    See also Brock v Minister for Justice   Customs   FCA    In the present proceedings  it is considered an abuse of process for the Applicant to now again seek to agitate the validity of the order made under s   and to thereby attempt to vitiate the subsequent s   determination followedTervonen v Minister for Justice   Customs  No     FCA       ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The approach urged upon the Court by Mr Karsten  namely an invitation to go behind the face of both the request and  more importantly  the warrant itself is an invitation which should be rejected  Section     framed as it is in terms of an   opinion   should not be construed as requiring the Attorney General or the Minister to become an expert in foreign law and construed in a manner which has the potential to frustrate the discharge by Australia of its obligations under extradition treaties  Tervonen v Minister for Justice   Customs  No     FCA       ALD    Rares J there observed      In Director of Public Prosecutions  Cth  v Kainhofer   HCA         CLR   at   Brennan CJ  Dawson and McHugh JJ left open the meaning to be attributed to the word  accused  in s  a i  of the Act  noting  It is sufficient to say that  in considering whether a person is an extraditable person under s  a i  of the Act  it is necessary to bear in mind the statutory object of enabling Australia to carry out its obligations under extradition treaties with countries that adopt a variety of criminal procedures different from our own     The Attorney General cannot be expected to be an expert in foreign law  Williams v Minister for Justice and Customs   FCAFC       FCR   at       Minds may differ as to the proper construction of s  a i  and whether a particular warrant relied on by an extradition country falls within it  as the decision of the Full Court  which the High Court reversed in Kainhofer   HCA         CLR     illustrates   For this reason s  a i  is framed so that the Attorney General must form the opinion that the person is an extraditable person    His Honour continued      Having regard to the terms of the warrants and other material before him  I am of opinion that it was open to Senator Ellison to form the opinion that they met the criterion in s  a i   Each warrant asserted that there was probable cause for suspecting that Mr Tervonen had committed an offence and that the Court which issued the warrant considered he ought be arrested          Each warrant  on its face  was termed a  warrant   It was issued by a Finnish court for the arrest of Mr Tervonen who was stated to have been suspected on probable cause of having committed an offence  The Minister could reasonably form the opinion that each document was a warrant  issued by a Finnish Court  in force  for the arrest of Mr Tervonen in relation to an offence against the law of Finland that he was accused of having committed within the meaning of s  a i   While other persons may not have formed the same view  having regard to the significant differences between the laws of other countries and Australia  to which Mason CJ  Dawson and McHugh JJ referred to in Kainhofer   HCA         CLR   at   I am of opinion that it was open to Senator Ellison to form the view that each of the warrants was one which met the description in s  a i    An appeal from this decision has been allowed in part  although it was not necessary for the Full Court to make any comment in relation to the above observations of the learned trial judge  Minister for Home Affairs v Tervonen   FCAFC    See also Cabal v United

Whether or not either of these two fields of inquiry can be properly characterised as   jurisdictional facts   thus need not be resolved  The resolution of whether a fact is jurisdictional or not remains a matter of statutory construction  Timbarra Protection Coalition Inc v Ross Mining NL   NSWCA   at       NSWLR   at   per Spigelman CJ  Mason P and Meagher JA agreeing   Less difficulty may be experienced in characterising as a   jurisdictional fact   a question as to whether a person has informed a magistrate of his consent  greater difficulty  however  may be experienced in characterising as   jurisdictional   whether a magistrate had   reason to believe that the consent was not given voluntarily    The potential inconvenience consequent upon construing s   in such a manner may be a telling reason to conclude that such matters are not   jurisdictional   cf Brock v United States of America   FCAFC   at   per Black CJ    FCAFC       FCR   followedVasiljkovic v Commonwealth   HCA       CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Extradition Act    Cth  sets forth a four stage process for the extradition of a person from Australia  These four stages have been summarised as follows by the Full Court in Harris v Attorney General  Cth      FCR   at     The Act contemplates four stages in extradition proceedings as follows    Commencement    Remand    Determination by a magistrate of eligibility for surrender    Executive determination that the person is to be surrendered  In summary form  the scheme is as follows  The commencement of proceedings is by the issue of a provisional warrant under s   or by the giving of a notice under s    Once arrested  the person is required by s   to be taken before a magistrate and remanded in custody or on bail for such period as may be necessary for eligibility proceedings to be taken under s    Where a person is on remand under s   and the Attorney General has given a notice under s   provision is made under s   for a magistrate to conduct proceedings to determine whether the person is eligible for surrender  If eligibility is so determined by the magistrate  provision is made by s   for the Attorney General to decide whether the person is to be surrendered   This approach has subsequently been endorsed by Gleeson CJ in Vasiljkovic v Commonwealth   HCA   at       HCA       CLR   and by Gummow J in Director of Public Prosecutions  Cth  v Kainhofer   HCA       CLR   at    It has most recently been endorsed by a Full Court of this Court in Minister for Home Affairs v Tervonen
