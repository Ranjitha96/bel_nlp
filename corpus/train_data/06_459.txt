No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The second issue arose because at   of the reasons in Rubibi No     I raised the question of whether the determination should limit the exploitation of the resources in the Yawuru claim area to non commercial exploitation  The Yawuru claimants opposed any such limitation and contended that that limitation would be inconsistent with their right to exclusive possession  which they claimed entitled the native title holders to determine the purposes for which the land and waters were to be used  The Yawuru claimants relied upon Sampi v State of Western Australia  No     FCA     Sampi No     in which it was contended that the determination of native title fishing rights should expressly exclude  non commercial rights   French J stated  at      Given that commercial fishing rights are subject to legislative control and that the native title rights and interests are to be exercisable in accordance with the laws of the State and the Commonwealth  it is difficult to see how the determination as proposed by the applicants would extend to commercial fishing rights   The Yawuru claimants contended that commercial exploitation of the resources of the land and waters in the Yawuru claim area is likewise the subject of extensive governmental regulation  They also pointed to s  a  of the NTA which only exempts native title holders from the restrictions imposed by that regulation for  non commercial communal needs  citedMembers of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v State of Victoria   HCA         CLR  http www

http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  WAFIC submitted   as a matter of formality  that all native title rights to take and use P  maxima  a species of pearl oyster  have been extinguished by the enactment of the Pearling Act    WA  and the legislative predecessors to that Act  particularly the Pearling Act    WA   The reason for the  formal  submission was that WAFIC accepted that in Sampi  on behalf of the Bardi and Jawi People  v Western Australia   FCA     Sampi   at     French J had rejected the same submission  WAFIC also accepted that the decision of French J would be followed by other single judges of the Court unless it was shown to be clearly wrong  Although WAFIC wished to preserve the point for any appeal  it did not contend that the decision of French J was clearly wrong  Accordingly  I reject WAFIC s submission for the reasons given by French J in Sampi   with which I respectfully agree   Several issues arose concerning the description of the native title holders  In accordance with the evidence concerning the traditional laws and customs acknowledged and observed by the Yawuru community  and the findings in Rubibi No   and Rubibi No     I am satisfied that     a  Lulu should not be named as one of the apical ancestors         b   i  membership of the native title holding community in the case of a descendant of an apical ancestor does not require the criteria of self identification or general community acceptance to be satisfied where both parents of the descendant are Yawuru   ii  where only one parent of a descendant is Yawuru  the criterion of self identification must be satisfied  and        c  persons who are not descendants of an apical ancestor may nonetheless be members of the native title holding community if they were adopted as children or grown up by a Yawuru person as a member of the Yawuru community  or are persons who were born in or have a long term physical association with the Yawuru claim area and have cultural responsibilities in relation to that area  provided that the criteria of self identification and general community acceptance are satisfied   The Walman Yawuru representative made certain criticisms of the criteria in  b  and  c  above  In particular  it was contended that the criterion of general community acceptance should apply where there was only one Yawuru parent  The criterion of general community acceptance referred to in par  c  above is based on the findings and observations I made concerning that matter at   and   in Rubibi   and at   and   in Rubibi     I have been troubled by whether that criterion should also apply to the situation of a descendant who has only one Yawuru parent but have decided  primarily on the basis of the evidence referred at   in Rubibi No     that that criterion is not required by traditional law and custom  However  it should be emphasised that in order for self identification to be genuine  something more is required than an announcement on a particular day that a person identifies himself or herself as a member of the Yawuru community  The genuineness of self identification is to be determined by reference to all relevant facts  which can include past conduct in relation to self identification  In all the circumstances  I am not satisfied that traditional law and custom requires that the additional criterion of general community acceptance must be satisfied in the case of a descendant who only has one Yawuru parent appliedNeowarra v State of Western Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Section   of the NTA as originally enacted  cf s  A of the current NTA   provided that an impermissible future act is invalid to the extent that it  affects native title   Section   of the NTA as originally enacted provided that an act affects native title if it extinguishes native title rights and interests  or if it is otherwise wholly or partly inconsistent with their continued existence  enjoyment or exercise  The freehold grants were future acts that were not validated by any provision of the NTA   with the result that they were impermissible future acts under the NTA as originally enacted and appear to be invalid to the extent that they affect native title  see Neowarra v State of Western Australia   FCA     Neowarra   at    While it can be accepted that the freehold grants are valid insofar as they do not affect native title  they cannot have any extinguishing effect or confer rights that are inconsistent with the native title rights and interests I have found to exist  However  as a result of my finding later in these reasons that reserve    which included   of the relevant freehold areas  was validly created  the native title rights and interests in respect of   of the relevant freeholds are not exclusive rights  It also appears that the remaining freehold lot was subject to a similar prior tenure or reserve  Accordingly  such of the rights and interests of the freehold owners as are not inconsistent with the rights and interests of the native title holders can co exist with those native title rights and interests   The State argued that  as the freehold grants were valid for some purposes  s  B could not apply to the grants  I doubt that the argument is correct but nothing turns on it because  as explained above  the freehold grants appear to have had no extinguishing effect on native title with the consequence that there was no extinguishment to be disregarded under s  B  In any event  no relevant occupation was established for the purposes of s  B so the section would not apply to the areas covered by the   freehold grants   However  the State contended for a different outcome in respect of areas covered by mining leases issued under the Mining Act    WA   the MA    The State relied upon the extensive rights conferred under s   of the MA to use  occupy and enjoy the land in respect of which the mining lease was granted  The rights included the right to do all things that are necessary to carry out  mining operations  in  on and under the land  The phrase  mining operations  is given a wide definition in s   of the MA   The State also relied upon the decisions in Neowarra  at   and   and Daniel  at     and   to contend that any permanent native title right to live on the land in respect of which a mining lease has been granted has been extinguished   In Rubibi Community v Western Australia  No     FCA         FCR   I determined that the date  when the application is made  is the date of the filing in the Court of the application for native title in respect of  the area  referred to in ss  A c  and  B c   Plainly   the area  referred to in those sub sections must be an area within the area the subject of a claimant application  However  as was explained by Sundberg J in Neowarra at   and   the area need not be the whole of the area claimed as that could lead to clearly unintended consequences in relation to the operation of ss  A and  B  Rather  the relevant area is the particular area with which each of the sections is concerned   Textual  contextual and purposive considerations all point to  the area  that is referred to in s  A c  being  the area  referred to in s  A b   That is   the area  is the particular area the subject of the defined freehold estate  the defined lease  the defined vesting or the land expressly held or reserved for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders  That was the view taken by Sundberg J in Neowarra  at   and  in my view  is clearly correct  Insofar as there may be doubt about that matter  pars         of the Explanatory Memorandum for the Native Title Amendment Bill     which inserted ss  A and  B  make it clear that the occupation is to be in respect of  the land  the subject of the past  land rights type  grant  trust  reservation or other historical act that would otherwise have extinguished native title in relation to that land  It follows that the occupation that must be established for the purposes of s  A c  is an occupation in respect of the relevant  area  that is the whole  rather than merely a part  of the particular area the subject of the freehold estate  lease  vesting etc   The situation under s  B differs from that under s  A because s  B requires that at the date the application is made  the area  is not covered by a freehold estate  lease  reservation etc  However  as was pointed out by Sundberg J in Neowarra at   the relevant area for the purposes of s  B is  the particular area in relation to which it has been concluded that  but for the section  native title rights would be extinguished   That construction of s  B is consistent with par     of the Explanatory Memorandum for the Native Title Amendment Bill   which states     Section  B is a statutory mechanism designed to allow native title claimants who are in occupation of vacant Crown land to overcome the effect of past extinguishment and have their claim determined by the Court  The current section   allows a claim for pastoral lease land  notwithstanding past extinguishment  where the claimants hold the pastoral lease  This provision will allow a claim for vacant Crown land where the claimants are in occupation of the land  notwithstanding possible extinguishment by any historical act   It follows that the occupation that must be established for the purposes of s  B c  must also be an occupation in respect of the whole  rather than merely a part  of the particular area in respect of which  but for s  B  native title rights would be extinguished  see Neowarra at       This approach has been accepted and followed in a number of other cases  see  for example  Daniel at   Alyawar at     and Neowarra at     In Neowarra at     Sundberg J considered the requirement in s  A b ii  that the area be held expressly for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples  His Honour considered that  expressly  meant not merely impliedly and not arising merely by inference  His Honour also referred to cases that had decided that for something to be express  rather than implied  it must arise directly from the language used and not by inference therefrom   Sundberg J then applied the above criteria to an association incorporated under the ACA Act and stated  at      The remaining question is whether  as they assert  the Rules of Kupungarri Aboriginal Corporation  under the ACA Act  show that Kupungarri holds the lease  expressly for the benefit of   Aboriginal peoples   Kupungarri s property is  available  at the discretion of the Committee  for the purpose of carrying out the objects of the Association   The objects in r   are all directed to the benefit of a group of Aboriginal people education  job training  housing  health services and so on  The Rules clearly and unmistakably disclose that Kupungarri s property is held by it for the benefit of Aboriginal persons  They make that explicit  There is no need to imply that from the Rules or any other source  The case falls within s  A b ii    The remaining issue is whether the requisite occupation has been established in respect of area    I accept  as did Sundberg J in Neowarra at   that a combination of activities in the area can amount to occupation by claim group members  notwithstanding that the area is also occupied by the corporation  The problem with the claim under s  A in respect of area   is that the activity relied upon is residence in one of the two houses on the area by a Yawuru claim group member  As explained above  s  A requires occupancy of the whole of the area  not merely part of the area  Accordingly  the requisite occupancy has not been established   The State argued that the area is not within s  A and that there is no relevant occupation  This area is a freehold block in Broome at which Bidyadanga Aboriginal Community La Grange Inc  an Aboriginal Association incorporated under the ACA  conducts a sobering up centre  The association is not relevantly distinguishable from the associations above  For the reasons given in respect of area   the area is held expressly for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples  However  the involvement of some Yawuru persons  as well as others  in co ordinating and using the centre is not sufficient to constitute occupation of the centre for the purposes of s  A   The State argued that this area is not within s  A and that there is no relevant occupation  For the reasons given in respect of area   this area is held by Nirrumbuk Aboriginal Corporation expressly for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples  However  the requisite occupation at the date of the application has not been established by the evidence   Although it was accepted by the parties that the resolution of the dispute involved matters of fact and degree  the State s submissions set out a number of useful examples and guidelines     In Hayes v Northern Territory   FCA         FCR     Hayes   at page    xiv  Justice Olney found that  it may well be inferred that  recreation equipment  would be both a structure and a fixture   Again  at page    viii  his Honour stated that      there is no evidence of any building or structure in the nature of a fixture other than possibly a fence      Clearly Justice Olney regarded recreation equipment and fences as examples of structures that could be considered as public works for the purposes of the NTA   This accords with the ordinary meaning of structure being simply something  built or constructed       At page   of Hayes his Honour said           Whether or not a particular structure is to be regarded as a fixture will depend upon the context in which that question has to be determined but the general principles are well established and do not need to be recited here           The general principles can be summarised as follows                The common law previously looked to the degree of annexation of an item  if substantially affixed  the item was a fixture  otherwise  it remained a chattel        The importance of annexation has  however  declined over time  and the focus now is on the intention with which the item was put in place  if for better use or enjoyment of the land  the item is a fixture  for better use or enjoyment of the item  it is likely to be a chattel            There are two prima facie presumptions applied                first  if an item is affixed to the land  it is presumed to be a fixture  and the burden of proof lies on those who assert it is not        second  if an item rests by its own weight  it is presumed not to be a fixture  and the burden of proof rests on those asserting that it is            The presumptions may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary  for example  stone blocks resting by their own weight and placed to form a dry stone wall would be intended for better enjoyment of the land  and hence a fixture  whereas such blocks stacked in a builders yard would not      A concrete rail head or culvert for a drain  on the principles set out above  is more likely to have been put in place to enhance enjoyment of the land  hence would be a fixture  regardless of whether it is affixed or resting of its own weight  Likewise  it cannot be said as a matter of generality that playground equipment or pine bollard fencing are not fixtures  as it will depend upon the intention of the person or persons who bring it onto the land      In Daniel v State of Western Australia   FCA   at   Nicholson J found that water tanks and sewerage and waste water treatment plants were public work previous exclusive possession acts      In Sampi at   and   his Honour Justice French found a radio site constructed by Telstra to be a public work previous exclusive possession act      As to major earthworks  the Explanatory Memorandum to the Native Title Bill   gave as examples               dams and weirs whose construction permanently and significantly disturbs or changes the land           Excluded from the examples given were digging wells  cultivating land for crops or establishing a walking trail in a National Park              In any event  as to the extent of the public works in each area  the First Respondent relies upon the decision of his Honour Justice Sundberg in Neowarra v State of Western Australia  No     FCA         FCR     Neowarra   at   to   to the effect that           Section  D  NTA  is specifically directed to public works  and is plainly intended to operate in conjunction with ss  B  and  C   There is no reason to deny its beneficial function of ensuring that a public work has the benefit of adjacent land that is necessary for or incidental to the operation of the work  especially in relation to access to landlocked works  appliedWestern Australia v The Commonwealth  Native Title Act Case    HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Commonwealth made submissions on this issue because two of the   freeholds in question are held by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission  In the course of the Commonwealth s submissions  it became apparent that the   freehold grants were in the Cable Beach area and probably had houses constructed upon them by the freehold grantees  or by purchasers from those grantees  who had not been informed of these proceedings or of the likelihood that their rights were subject to the rights and interests of the native title holders  This extraordinary situation apparently came about because the Western Australian statutory regime relied upon by the State  to ensure that freeholds granted by it after   January   prevailed over native title  was held by the High Court in State of Western Australia v The Commonwealth  Native Title Act Case    HCA         CLR    the Native Title Act Case   to be invalid  Plainly  the situation is one that will have to be resolved between owners of the freeholds  the State and the native title holders  One likely method of resolution is an indigenous land use agreement under which the native title holders may relinquish their native title rights and interests on appropriate terms   When this issue arose at the hearing  I expressed grave concern at how the matter had arrived at this stage without the freehold grantees or their purchasers having notice of the likelihood that the freehold grants are invalid to the extent that they affect native title  The Commonwealth s response to my concern appears to provide the answer which is that  properly construed  the relevant application of the Yawuru claimants did not claim the areas in respect of which the freehold grants were made  If that contention is correct that would preclude the Court from making a determination of native title in respect of the relevant areas but it will not make the problem disappear  As against the State I have found that  subject to extinguishment  native title exists throughout the Yawuru claim area  Even if the   lots do not technically fall within that area they are not relevantly distinguishable from the surrounding areas in which native title has been found to exist  It must follow that the problem created by the State by its   freehold grants  which were not validated by the NTA   will still have to be resolved by the relevant parties   I now turn to consider whether the   lots fall within the Yawuru claim area  The relevant application  WN  which was filed on   January   was known  prior to the consolidation of the various applications  as Rubibi       The application was lodged with the Native Title Tribunal on   January   which was prior to the decision in the Native Title Act Case   After certain amendments  which were made during January   the application was accepted by the Native Title Tribunal  The application was in the form prescribed by Sch   of the NTA which  relevantly  provided for a description and a map of the area covered by the application and for the applicants to set out the information known to them about other interests in relation to the land and waters in the claim area  see pars A  and A  of the prescribed form  Paragraph A  of the amended application stated that the area covered by the application was the land indicated on the attached map  It added that     The land claimed is in the State of Western Australia in the West Kimberley Region and covers all areas of land  currently designated Vacant Crown Land or Reserve   as fall within the area edged and hatched in heavy black lines on the accompanying map  save and except  certain specified Reserves         emphasis added appliedSouth Australia v Tanner   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The law applicable to a challenge to the validity of a regulation made in the exercise of a statutory power to make regulations would appear to be applicable to the analogous exercise of a power to reserve land for certain purposes under a regulation that provides for the exercise of that power  In South Australia v Tanner   HCA         CLR   at     Brennan J stated that  as the validity of a regulation depends on whether it answers the statutory description  the problem is one of characterisation  His Honour explained that the character of the regulation is ascertained by the court s own assessment of the directness and substantiability of the connection between the likely operation of the regulation and the statutory object to be served  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ stated  at          there must be conceded a broad  rather than a narrow  approach in determining the nexus between the exercise of the power and the achievement of the purpose for which it is conferred      and  at      In the course of argument the parties accepted the reasonable proportionality test of validity  cf  Deane J  in The Commonwealth v Tasmania  the Tasmanian Dam Case  namely  whether the regulation is capable of being considered to be reasonably proportionate to the pursuit of the enabling purpose    footnote omitted  Regulation   is in the broadest of terms and extends to any purpose of public  utility  or of  otherwise facilitating the improvement and settlement of the Colony   In my view   public purposes adjoining Broome  Roebuck Bay  is plainly capable of being considered reasonably proportionate to the pursuit of the enabling purpose and therefore falls within reg    It is a purpose that is implicitly  if not explicitly  associated with the development of the Broome township and  as such  is both directly and substantially connected to being a purpose of public  utility  and is also capable of being characterised as a purpose facilitating the improvement and settlement of Broome in the Colony of Western Australia   In Ward HC   the question of extinguishment in respect of a reserve was carefully considered in the majority judgment at            It is important to recall that the ultimate question is whether  by the steps that were taken  the Crown created in others  or asserted  rights in relation to the land that were inconsistent with native title rights and interests over the land  It was submitted that the features of the statutory regulation of public reserves which we have mentioned indicated that reservation  even without vesting  amounted to dedication to the purpose specified in the instrument of reservation in the sense  so it was submitted  that reservation prevented the Crown from applying the land to some other purpose and created some right in members of the public generally or a section of the public       The reference by Brennan J  in the passage of his reasons in Mabo  No   that is set out earlier  to use of the land that is reserved  may distract attention from the relevant inquiries  They are  as we have said  whether rights have been created in others that are rights inconsistent with native title rights and interests  and whether the Crown has asserted rights over the land that are inconsistent with native title rights and interests  Use of the land may suggest  it may even demonstrate  that such rights have been created or asserted  but the basic inquiry is about inconsistency of rights  not inconsistency of use  Further  as has already been pointed out  it is often necessary to examine inconsistency by reference to the particular native title right and interest concerned                     Nevertheless  by designating land as a reserve for a public purpose  even a purpose as broadly described as  public utility  the executive  acting pursuant to legislative authority  decided the use or uses to which the land could be put  The executive thus exercised the power that was asserted at settlement by saying how the land could be used  The exercise of that power was inconsistent with any continued exercise of power by native title holders to decide how the land could or could not be used  The executive had taken to itself and asserted  pursuant to the authority conferred in that regard by statute  the right to say how the land could be used  This step was not  however  necessarily inconsistent with the native title holders continuing to use the land in whatever way they had  according to traditional laws and customs  been entitled to use it before its reservation       The reason that the right to use the land may have survived reservation is the same reason that the grant of a pastoral lease extinguished the right to control access to the land  but not necessarily all the rights of native title holders to use it in accordance with the rights held under traditional laws or customs  The provisions of the Acts providing a penalty for  unlawful or unauthorised use or occupation  of lands  including  lands reserved for or dedicated to any public purpose  did not  on their proper construction  prohibit use or occupation by native title holders  It is  therefore  not right to say  as a proposition of universal application  as Western Australia submitted  that reserved lands could not lawfully be used except for the reserved purpose  The facts that the   amendments to the Land Act   permitted leasing of reserves not immediately required for their purpose or that in   the Land Act   was amended to permit leasing or licensing of certain kinds of reserve for depasturing stock require no different conclusion  Whether a right in native title holders to use the land continued unextinguished depends upon other considerations  particularly what  if any  rights in others were created by the reservation or later asserted by the executive       The designation of land as a reserve for certain purposes did not  without more  create any right in the public or any section of the public which  by reason of inconsistency and apart from the State Validation Act   extinguished native title rights and interests                     The majority of the Full Court treated the use that had been made of reserved land  even land that had been vested in a body or person  as determining whether native title had been extinguished  So  for example  it was held in relation to Reserve    a reserve which had been created in   for  public utility  but had not been vested in any body or person  that  t he general use of the area for watering cattle  and as a pastoral lease destroyed the exclusivity of native title rights   Their Honours went on to say that  t he close use  of the area of Reserve   which now forms part of another reserve  would have wholly extinguished native title in that area   Similarly  in the case of reserves vested in a body  their Honours looked to the use that had been made of the land       As we have said earlier  we consider that looking to the use that has actually been made of land distracts attention from the central inquiry which is an inquiry about rights created in others or asserted by the executive  not the way in which they may have been exercised at any time  Neither the Full Court nor the primary judge considered that central inquiry   The above passages provide the answer to the State s submission  By creating the reserves for a gaol and a police station  the executive did not create rights in others  Rather  the executive asserted its right to say how the land could be used and the assertion of that right extinguished any native title right to control or say how the land could or could not be used  However  that was not necessarily inconsistent with the native title holders continuing to use the land in whatever way they had  according to traditional laws and customs  been entitled to use it before its reservation citedBathurst City Council v PWC Properties Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It can be accepted that the phrase  public purposes  has a broad meaning  In Bathurst City Council v PWC Properties Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR     Bathurst   at     Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ stated that the phrase  public purposes  connotes  the giving to the public of some rights in the land which subtract from the Crown s full ownership   Their Honours stated at        the meaning of  public purposes  depends in part upon the scope and purposes of the particular legislation    appliedWestern Australia v Ward   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Further  in the majority judgment in Western Australia v Ward   HCA         CLR     Ward HC   at         their Honours observed         Reservation of land under the relevant Western Australian provisions inhibited the Crown s future action in relation to that land  The inhibition  however  was not  and could not be  absolute  As Windeyer J pointed out in Randwick Corporation v Rutledge   even if land were dedicated to a public purpose  it did not take the land outside the authority of the legislature  Moreover  under the Western Australian statutes  reserves  other than those dealt with by the Permanent Reserves Act    WA  and its legislative successor  could be cancelled or the purpose of the reservation altered by executive act  Even permanent reserves could be cancelled or the purpose of the reservation altered by statute  Further  as had been held in Williams v Attorney General for New South Wales  the Government House Case   the Crown appropriating lands to a particular purpose  without the creation of a trust  did not mean that the land became dedicated to that purpose  or that it could not later be used by the Crown for some other purpose       Nevertheless  by designating land as a reserve for a public purpose  even a purpose as broadly described as  public utility  the executive  acting pursuant to legislative authority  decided the use or uses to which the land could be put  The executive thus exercised the power that was asserted at settlement by saying how the land could be used  The exercise of that power was inconsistent with any continued exercise of power by native title holders to decide how the land could or could not be used  The executive had taken to itself and asserted  pursuant to the authority conferred in that regard by statute  the right to say how the land could be used  This step was not  however  necessarily inconsistent with the native title holders continuing to use the land in whatever way they had  according to traditional laws and customs  been entitled to use it before its reservation    footnotes omitted  Although their Honours were not determining the precise legal consequences of a reservation of land for public purposes  there is nothing in the above passages that suggests that there is any particular difficulty with such a reservation   For the above reasons  I am satisfied that reserve   was created for one of the purposes specified in reg     and was validly created   Reserves     and   were created for  public purposes  under the Land Regulations    WA  which were not relevantly distinguishable from the Land Regulations    WA  save that the later regulations assumed that reserves could be created for  public purposes  see regs   and    which defined  public purposes   Thus  if there is any distinction to be drawn between the two sets of regulations  it is one that provides added support to the State s argument in favour of the valid creation of the relevant reserves  As it was accepted by the parties that the finding in respect of reserve   would determine the issue of validity in respect of all four of these reserves  I need not pursue this aspect of the matter further  It follows that reserves     and   were also validly created   On   April   a special lease was purportedly granted under s   of the Land Act    WA   the LA     over Broome Lot    which comprises all of area    The lease  which was for a term of five years commencing on   April   was for the purpose of  a foreshore

claimed in respect of the areas on which the gaol and the police station have been constructed  As I later explain  it is common ground that extinguishment has occurred in any event in respect of those areas because the gaol and police station are public works  The contest relates to the vacant land in the reserves that has not yet been used for the purposes of a gaol or police station  Although a similar issue was considered in Daniel v State of Western Australia   FCA     Daniel   at   and   the question of whether the assertion of the right to build a gaol or a prison on part of the reserved land extinguished inconsistent native title rights over the whole of the reserved land was not considered in Daniel or Ward HC    Although it was accepted by the parties that the

    Whether or not a particular structure is to be regarded as a fixture will depend upon the context in which that question has to be determined but the general principles are well established and do

affixed  the item was a fixture  otherwise  it remained a chattel        The importance of annexation has  however  declined over time  and the focus now is on the intention with which the item was put in place  if for better use or enjoyment of the land  the item is a fixture  for better use or enjoyment of the item  it is likely to be a chattel            There are two prima facie presumptions applied                first  if an item is affixed to the land  it is presumed to be a fixture  and the burden of proof lies on those who assert it is not        second  if an item rests by its own weight  it is presumed not to be a fixture  and the burden of proof rests on those asserting that it is            The presumptions may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary  for example  stone blocks resting by their own weight and placed to form a dry stone wall would be intended for better enjoyment of the land  and hence a fixture  whereas such blocks stacked in a builders yard would not      A concrete rail head or culvert for a drain  on the principles set out above  is more likely to have been put in place to enhance enjoyment of the land  hence would be a fixture  regardless of whether it is affixed or resting of its own weight  Likewise  it cannot be said as a matter of generality that playground equipment or pine bollard fencing are not fixtures  as it will depend upon the intention of the person or persons who bring it onto the land      In Daniel v State of Western Australia   FCA   at   Nicholson J found that water tanks and sewerage and waste water treatment plants

public works in each area  the First Respondent relies upon the decision of his Honour Justice Sundberg in Neowarra v State of Western Australia  No     FCA         FCR     Neowarra   at   to   to the effect that           Section  D  NTA  is specifically directed to public works  and is plainly intended to operate in conjunction with ss  B  and  C   There is no reason to deny its beneficial function of ensuring that a public work has the benefit of adjacent land that is necessary for or incidental to the operation of the work  especially in relation to access to landlocked works  appliedDe Rose v South Australia  No     FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  There remains the question of whether  by constructing a gaol and a police station on the reserves  the Crown  created in others  or asserted  rights in relation to the land that were inconsistent with native title rights and interests over the land  see   in Ward HC   In my view  the exercise of the right to construct a gaol or police station on part only of the reserved land is not necessarily inconsistent with native title rights and interests in the remaining part of the reserved land if that part of the reserve is not reasonably necessary for  or incidental to  the operation or enjoyment of the gaol or police station  cf De Rose v South Australia  No     FCAFC         FCR     De Rose No     at     and      In De Rose No     that formulation was applied in respect of the extinguishment that occurred upon the exercise by the lessee of the lessee s right under a pastoral lease to construct improvements  In the present context  the exercise of the right to construct an improvement on a reserve in pursuance of the reserved purpose is analogous to the exercise of the right to construct an improvement under a pastoral lease  Accordingly  it is appropriate to apply the same criterion  As that criterion is similar to  but not identical with  the criterion that is to be applied to the gaol and police station as public works under s  D of the NTA   it is appropriate to deal with both criteria in the context of the extinguishment that resulted from the construction of the gaol and the police station as public works   In summary  construction of the gaol and police station on part of the reserves extinguished native title rights and interests in the areas on which the gaol and police station were constructed and on areas adjacent thereto that were reasonably necessary for or incidental to the operation or enjoyment of the gaol or police station  However  the construction did not necessarily extinguish native title rights and interests in respect of the remaining areas of the respective reserves   It was common ground that  as a result of the decision in Ward HC   the grant of valid pastoral or mining leases was inconsistent with  and therefore extinguished  any native title right or interest to exclusive possession of  or to control access to or use of  the areas the subject of the leases  It was also common ground that  as a result of the decision of the Full Court in De Rose No   at         the exercise by the pastoral lessees of their rights under the leases to construct improvements on the land leased was inconsistent with the continuation of any inconsistent native title rights or interests insofar as they related to the land on which the improvements were constructed and any adjacent land the use of which was reasonably necessary for  or incidental to  the operation or enjoyment of the improvements appliedNorthern Territory of Australia v Alyawarr  Kaytetye  Warumungu  Wakaya Native Title Claim Group   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The issue on which the Yawuru claimants and the State differed concerned whether the native title right and interest  to live  on the leased land was inconsistent with the rights conferred by the pastoral or mining leases  The State accepted that I was bound by the decision of the Full Court in Northern Territory of Australia v Alyawarr  Kaytetye  Warumungu  Wakaya Native Title Claim Group   FCAFC         FCR     Alyawarr   at         to find that the native title right to live on a pastoral lease is not inconsistent with the rights of the lessee under the lease  In Alyawarr   the Full Court stated at              The pastoral leases which have affected the claim area in the present case are historical grants  The relevant extinguishment of native title rights and interests derives only from inconsistency with the rights historically conferred by those leases  No question of prospective activity under a subsisting pastoral lease arises  Consistently with what was said by Nicholson J in Daniel  No   and Sundberg J in Neowarra   the right to  live  on the land can be interpreted as a right to live permanently on the land without any conflict with pastoral leaseholders  rights  That right does not necessarily involve permanent settlement at a particular place  The issue therefore reduces to the question whether a native title right of permanent settlement is inconsistent with a pastoral leaseholder s rights  There is no logical reason why it must be so  Just as the right to live permanently on the land does not necessarily give rise to inconsistency with the pastoral leaseholder s rights  neither does the right to erect a permanent structure  The existence of such a structure does not preclude a pastoralist s right to require its removal in the event that it conflicts with a proposed exercise by the pastoralist of a right under the lease  It is not inevitable that such a conflict will arise       The inconsistency posited by the Northern Territory in respect of the grant of historical pastoral leases long expired  is based on a theoretical conflict which would not inevitably have occurred  No inconsistency of rights giving rise to extinguishment of the native title right to live on the land and to erect permanent structures thereon is demonstrated  The concept of  permanency  referred to here is  in any event  a relative one       The right defined in par  b  to live on the land  to camp  to erect shelters and other structures  and to travel over and visit any part of the land and waters  should stand   Accordingly  subject to the outcome of any appeal in Alyawarr   the State accepts that the determination proposed by the Yawuru claimants  which includes a native title right to live in the areas covered by pastoral leases  should stand   The passages relied upon by the parties must now be considered in the light of the Full Court decisions in Alyawarr and De Rose No     As was pointed out in Alyawarr   a right to live upon the land does not necessarily involve permanent settlement at a particular place  Thus  even if a permanent structure was erected in pursuance of the right to live upon the land  that  does not preclude a pastoralist s right to require its removal in the event that it conflicts with a proposed exercise by the pastoralist of a right under the lease  see Alyawarr at    Their Honours added that it  is not inevitable that such a conflict will arise    The same reasoning applies to the exercise of the extensive range of rights conferred under a mining lease  A native title right to live on the land leased is not necessarily inconsistent with any of the rights conferred under a mining lease  In the event there is a necessary inconsistency  the lessee s rights will prevail  As is clear from the reasoning in De Rose No     if the right under the lease was  for example  to erect improvements necessary for mining operations  the exercise of that right will extinguish any inconsistent native title rights  including the right to live on the land  in respect of the area on which the improvements have been constructed and any adjacent area necessary for their enjoyment  However  it is not suggested that there has been any exercise of rights that are inconsistent with a native title right to live on the areas the subject of the mining leases that are within the Yawuru claim area   Accordingly  I do not accept the State s contention that the rights conferred by the grant of the mining leases under the MA are necessarily inconsistent with  and therefore extinguish  a native title right to live on the leased land  However  the native title right to live on the leased land is qualitatively different from a native title right to live on land in respect of which the holders of the native title right have a right of exclusive possession because  in the latter case  the right of the holder is not subject to the risk of subsequent extinguishment   The more difficult question arising under ss  A and  B concerns the requirement that there be occupation of the relevant area  In Alyawarr at       the Full Court discussed several cases which had considered that requirement         The requirement of occupation in s  A of the NT Act  which is the same as that in s  B  was considered by Beaumont and von Doussa JJ in Ward FC     Their Honours considered that a broad view should be taken of the word  at        We think this requirement is met where a claimant member is one of many people who share occupancy  and that the land may be relevantly occupied even though the person is rarely present on the lands so long as the person makes use of the land for the reserved purpose as and when that person wishes to do so            In Rubibi Community v Western Australia   FCA         FCR   Merkel J found the following activities to evidence occupation of an area of land for the purposes of s  A c  of the NT Act        continuing supervisory and protective activities of the senior Yawuru men in relation to the claim area        the holding of traditional ceremonies on the claim area as and when the senior lawmen authorised those activities        continued storage of sacred objects on the claim area        occupancy of the Leregon structures constructed on the claim area by members of the Lee family who are acknowledged to be members of the Rubibi claim group        In Passi v Queensland   FCA   Black CJ  on a consent determination  said that although the islands the subject of that determination were not permanently inhabited the evidence showed that the Meriam people used the land as and when they wished  Its use was consistent with its reserved purpose  His Honour was satisfied that the people occupied the relevant islands  In Daniel at   Nicholson J also applied what Beaumont and von Doussa JJ had said in Ward FC     He equated  connection  and  occupation        As Toohey J said in Mabo  No   at   presence on land does not have to be possession at law to amount to occupancy  He referred to United States and Canadian cases which established occupancy by reference to the demands of the land and society in question  in accordance with the way of life  habits  customs and usages of the  indigenous people  who are its users and occupiers  Sac and Fox Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma v United States     F  d   at    His Honour observed in particular that      a nomadic lifestyle is not inconsistent with occupancy   In reliance upon the cases referred to by the Full Court  the Yawuru claimants adduced extensive evidence of connection with  visits to and use of  numerous urban and bush areas within the Yawuru claim area  The evidence was relied upon by the Yawuru claimants to contend that the traditional connection with  and use of  the areas in question over a period of time by certain members of the claimant group constituted occupation of those areas at the relevant date  The Yawuru claimants even argued that they did not have to establish use because the entitlement I had found to exclusive possession of the Yawuru claim area  which was subject to the findings on extinguishment  was sufficient to constitute occupation  The argument is erroneous as it fails to distinguish between the criteria under s   of the NTA that must be satisfied in order to justify a finding of a native title right to exclusive occupation and the discrete requirement in ss  A and  B for occupation as a matter of fact   The State contended that the difficulty with the broad brush approach adopted by the Yawuru claimants is that it equates visits to and use of an area from time to time with occupation of that area  While use and visitation may be sufficient in some instances  each case will depend on its own facts   This approach has been accepted and followed in a number of other cases  see  for example  Daniel at   Alyawar at     and Neowarra at   citedDaniel v State of Western Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The Yawuru claimants disputed the State s contentions  They relied upon a later decision of RD Nicholson J in Daniel v State of Western Australia   FCA       to contend that a mining lease is not relevantly distinguishable from a pastoral lease  Under both leases  so it was argued  a native title right to live on the land the subject of the lease is not inconsistent with the rights of the lessees under the relevant leases although the Yawuru claimants accepted that  upon the exercise of some of the lessee s rights  inconsistent native title rights and interests may be extinguished   RD Nicholson J adopted this approach in Daniel at     Although it is not necessary to establish frequent use of the land  it is clear that frequency of the use of the land can be a relevant factor in determining whether or not there is occupation of that land   In Ward FC at     use of the land for the reserved purpose was regarded as an indicator of occupation  In Daniel  at   RD Nicholson J also regarded it as significant that the claimants made use of the land  for its purpose as and when  they wished  to do so   The references in the cases to the  purpose  of the use  at least in relation to s  A  indicate that a traditional use of the area  or a use that is consistent with the purpose of the reservation  being for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples  may be more likely to result in a finding of occupation of  the area   The reason for that was explained by Olney J in Hayes in the passage referred to above appliedRubibi Community v Western Australia  No     FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In Rubibi Community v Western Australia  No     FCA         FCR   I determined that the date  when the application is made  is the date of the filing in the Court of the application for native title in respect of  the area  referred to in ss  A c  and  B c   Plainly   the area  referred to in those sub sections must be an area within the area the subject of a claimant application  However  as was explained by Sundberg J in Neowarra at   and   the area need not be the whole of the area claimed as that could lead to clearly unintended consequences in relation to the operation of ss  A and  B  Rather  the relevant area is the particular area with which each of the sections is concerned citedWestern Australia v Ward   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Although occupation is a question of fact involving matters of fact and degree  some general principles can be discerned from the cases  In Western Australia v Ward   FCA         FCR     Ward FC   Beaumont and von Doussa JJ considered the meaning of the term  occupy  in ss  A and  B and stated  at        A broad view should be taken of the word  occupy  in the requirement in s  A c  that one or more members of the native title claim group occupy the area  citedHayes v Northern Territory   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In Hayes v Northern Territory   FCA         FCR     Hayes   at     Olney J pointed out that  given the context in which s  B was enacted  namely as part of Parliament s response to the decision in Wik Peoples v Queensland   HCA         CLR   the requirement for occupation of the land should be understood in the sense that the indigenous people had traditionally occupied the land  rather than in the sense of occupation according to common law principles  His Honour then stated at          The use of traditional country by members of the relevant claimant group which is neither random nor co incidental but in accordance with the way of life  habits  customs and usages of the group is in the context of the legislation sufficient to indicate occupation of the land    A similar approach was adopted by French J in Sampi at     In Ward FC at     use of the land for the reserved purpose was regarded as an indicator of occupation  In Daniel  at   RD Nicholson J also regarded it as significant that the claimants made use of the land  for its purpose as and when  they wished  to do so   The references in the cases to the  purpose  of the use  at least in relation to s  A  indicate that a traditional use of the area  or a use that is consistent with the purpose of the reservation  being for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples  may be more likely to result in a finding of occupation of  the area   The reason for that was explained by Olney J in Hayes in the passage referred to above   The State argued that the kind of occupation contemplated by ss  A and  B was traditional occupation  in the sense of use of the land in accordance with traditional laws and customs  rather than random or co incidental use  Whilst random or co incidental use may be unlikely to constitute occupation  and traditional use may be more likely to constitute occupation  there is no proper basis for reading a requirement of traditional occupation into ss  A and  B  However  traditional use was successfully relied upon to establish occupation in Hayes and Daniel   Where the use is not traditional  the question remains whether the evidence about connection  use  habitation or visitation is sufficient to warrant a conclusion  as a matter of fact  that the requisite occupation has been established   Finally  it is not necessary for the occupation of the land to be exclusive or confined in fact to persons who are members of the claimant group  In Ward FC  at     Beaumont and von Doussa JJ noted that it was sufficient for the claim group member to be  one of many people who share occupancy  and that occupation by non claimant persons does not preclude the claimants from occupying the area  However  in my view  if the evidence establishes a similar non traditional use of the relevant area by the general public  the fact that some members of the public using the area are claim group members is unlikely to be sufficient to justify a finding of occupation of the area by one or more claim group members  The Shire of Broome contended that  where the physical presence of a claim group member in an urban area is for a purpose and of a character that is indistinguishable from the physical presence of a member of the public  the presence should not be considered to be  occupation  for the purposes of ss  A or  B  Although there is merit in the Shire s submission  I would not go so far as to accept it as a criterion for refusing to find the requisite occupation  However  general public use of the relevant area is a relevant  if not a determinative  factor  Ultimately  the question is whether the requisite occupation by a claim group member has been established   The Yawuru claimants argued that their traditional connection with the Yawuru claim area  or with specific areas  distinguishes the use of claim areas by claim group members from use by the general public  While that question is a matter for evidence  I do not accept that the connection contended for can be assumed in respect of use of public areas where the use of those areas by claim group members is not a use for a traditional activity and is not distinguishable from use of the areas by other members of the public   Although it was accepted by the parties that the resolution of the dispute involved matters of fact and degree  the State s submissions set out a number of useful examples and guidelines     In Hayes v Northern Territory   FCA         FCR     Hayes   at page    xiv  Justice Olney found that  it may well be inferred that

for the benefit of Aboriginal peoples citedGumana v Northern Territory of Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The State contended  correctly in my view  that exclusive native title was not recognised in these areas under s  c  of the NTA   As a consequence  ss  A and  B cannot be relied upon to claim exclusive possession because the sections are concerned with past extinguishment  rather than non recognition  see Gumana v Northern Territory of Australia   FCA   at      The State contended that past extinguishment by the exercise of the right to erect an improvement on a leasehold to which s  A or s  B applies  is not to be disregarded notwithstanding that the sections require the grant of the lease or prior interest to be disregarded  In my view  the contention is not correct because the past extinguishment only occurred by the grant of the lease or prior interest which conferred the right to construct the improvement  As is clear from De Rose No   at   the extinguishment arises from the grant of the lease and operates when the improvement is constructed  It follows that  if the grant of the lease or other prior interest is to be disregarded under s  A or s  B  there can be no extinguishing effect by the exercise of the right to construct the improvement   Public works that are category A past acts  s   or previous exclusive possession acts  s  B  extinguish native title  A public work is defined in s   of the NTA to mean       a  any of the following that is constructed or established by or on behalf of the Crown  or a local government body or other statutory authority of the Crown  in any of its capacities             i  a building  or other structure  including a memorial  that is a fixture  or    ii  a road  railway or bridge  or    iia  where the expression is used in or for the purposes of a Division   or  A of Part   a stock route  or    iii  a well  or bore  for obtaining water  or    iv  any major earthworks  or            b  a building that is constructed with the authority of the Crown  other than on a lease  citedMabo v Queensland  No     HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  If settlements do not occur and native title claims have to be resolved in an adversarial proceeding  there remains the risk for the claimant community that native title may prove to be yet another of the prospects held out to indigenous communities where the realisable gain falls short of that originally expected as a result of the decision in Mabo v Queensland  No     HCA         CLR    However  if compromises are able to be achieved  the cause of reconciliation between Australia s past and present will be greatly advanced and the economic  social and educational benefits available to all Australians may be better able to be accessed by members of claimant communities   There remains the question of how the present native title gridlock may be resolved by mediation  Plainly  some changes to the present system of mediation and resolution are necessary  The areas of possible change include       a  amending s   of the NTA to   i  make it quite clear that the requirement of agreement of parties to mediated outcome only applies to the parties whose interests are affected by the outcome  s   of the NTA      ii  empower the Court to give effect to a mediated outcome of part of the claim when that is agreed to by all parties whose interests are affected by that outcome  leaving it to the remaining parties to contest the balance of the proceeding only insofar as their interests are affected by the outstanding and unresolved part of the claim         b  providing for formal and confidential offers of settlement to be made by parties in the course of mediation the offers may be presented to the trial court after a final determination has been made so that adverse costs consequences may follow for the parties for whom the final outcome was not greater than that offered in the mediation   c  greater emphasis being placed in mediation on case management and the narrowing of contested issues thereby reducing costs and enhancing the efficiency of the trial process   d  reviewing the guidelines for Commonwealth funding of NTA claims to include as one of the guidelines whether there has been a recommendation of a mediator that the funded party has made a bona fide and reasonable endeavour to resolve the dispute     e  each state party developing a mediated settlement model that may be used generally by the state party for mediated outcomes  and   f  adopting a practice in mediation and in the Court of determining issues that have not been resolved by mediation at an early hearing such a practice will require the parties to finally decide to either settle or contest the native title claim   Hopefully  if notice is taken of the above observations  it might diminish the risk of  and the harm that can flow from  a final finding at an adversarial hearing that the  tide of history  has washed away recognition of a community s native title under Australian law  It might also greatly advance the reconciliation between Australia s past and present     I certify that the preceding one hundred and seventy   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Merkel   Associate Dated
