the majority indicated  at   that  in Shaw   a  majority of the Court also held at   that Patterson should be regarded as authority for what it decided respecting s   of the Constitution and the constructive failure in the exercise of jurisdiction by the Minister     That is  it should not be regarded as authoritative in deciding what the law was pertaining to identification of who are aliens  Shaw at         This is particularly telling given that there is a material factual distinction between the present case and that considered in Patterson   In that case  one member of the majority  McHugh J  posited that a British subject living in Australia at the time of the enactment of the Royal Style and Titles Act    Cth  in   was not an alien  In the present case  the deceased was not living in Australia in   but had returned to Scotland at that time for about four years after only a two year presence in Australia  Hence  it would seem even on the stated reasoning in Patterson that a majority of the Justices would have been of the view that the deceased in this case was an alien  That this conclusion was the correct result has been confirmed by the decision in Shaw      The Minister contends that there is no basis for contending that the officer who took the deceased into detention failed to hold a reasonable suspicion that the applicant was an unlawful non citizen even as the law stood in February    which is not the correct test for the reasons outlined above      The High Court decided  in Ruddock v Taylor   that it was sufficient to found a reasonable suspicion in that case  at          a  that the detaining officers had been provided with what  on its face  appeared to be a regular and effective decision of the Minister to cancel the respondent s visa  and   b  each officer had checked whether the respondent had any other visa          It did not make the detention unlawful in Ruddock v Taylor that the High Court had  in an earlier decision  quashed the cancellation  What was determinative was the power to detain in s   of the Act  That power is not based on the validity or otherwise of the cancellation decision that founds the reasonable suspicion      In the case before this Court  Mr Coleman was detained on   February   after the first respondent had cancelled his visa pursuant to s   of the Act  The evidence establishes that the officer who detained Mr Coleman  Mr Robicheau  held the view that the deceased was an unlawful non citizen  The Minister s first contention is that this view was plainly correct and  as such  Mr Robicheau relevantly knew him to be such  In any event  the evidence establishes Mr Robicheau s reasonable suspicion under s          a  first  Mr Robicheau was provided with the cancellation decision     b  second  Mr Robicheau reviewed Mr Coleman s file documents  and   c  third  Mr Robicheau formed the view that in light of the cancellation decision and the fact that he did not hold any other visas  that he was an unlawful non citizen          Once Mr Coleman s detention was lawful on   February   nothing remains of the applicant s case for a declaration and damages for false imprisonment  There is no change pleaded between   February   and   December   that would make the lawful detention unlawful     The respondents submit that the cancellation decision of the first respondent  acted upon by Mr Robicheau  resulted in the lawful detention of Mr Coleman  There is no cause of action disclosed by the FASC  In those circumstances the applicant has no reasonable prospect of successfully

hopeless or bound to fail  s  A    The FASC should be dismissed   In response  counsel for the applicant effectively resiled from the pleading at   and from part of the pleading at   of the FASC  excerpted at   above  by stating that the applicant no longer pressed that the respondents  in particular the first respondent s officer Mr Robicheau  had no cause to reasonably suspect that Mr Coleman was an unlawful non citizen within the meaning of the Act  Having regard to the unchallenged evidence of Mr Robicheau referred to in   above and his unchallenged evidence that at the time of Mr Coleman s detention he continued to reasonably suspect that he was an unlawful non citizen and that at no subsequent stage leading up to the formal transfer of Mr Coleman to Villawood Immigration Detention Centre did he cease to hold a reasonable suspicion that Mr Coleman was an unlawful non citizen  coupled with the following observations of Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Heydon JJ in Ruddock v Taylor at         At the trial of these proceedings  those officers who had been responsible for effecting the respondent s detention gave unchallenged evidence of the steps each had taken before detaining the respondent  Each officer had been provided with what  on its face  appeared to be a regular and effective decision of the Minister to cancel the respondent s visa  Each officer checked whether the respondent held any other visa  Upon finding that he did not  the officer concerned detained the respondent        Plainly  each suspected that the respondent was an unlawful non citizen  It was not suggested that either had acted in bad faith  The conclusion that each reasonably suspected that the respondent was an unlawful non citizen follows inevitably        It also follows from that fact  and the reasons given earlier  that the respondent s detention was lawful and required by the Act  Nothing was said to have occurred during either period of detention that would affect the conclusions that  until an order was made quashing the relevant decision to cancel the respondent s visa  those who detained the respondent reasonably suspected that he was an unlawful non citizen  and that accordingly  his detention was lawful and required by the Act     there is no doubt  in my view  that counsel for the applicant was correct in resiling from the pleading in the way he did   This argument has a number of hurdles in the way of raising unlawful detention to a level of being a cause of action with reasonable prospects of success      First  as Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Heydon JJ observed in Ruddock v Taylor at   a majority of the High Court in Shaw held that Re Patterson is not to be understood as overruling Nolan v Minister for Immigration   Ethnic Affairs   HCA         CLR   but even it were to be so understood      what were reasonable grounds for effecting the respondent s detention did not retrospectively cease to be reasonable upon the Court making its orders in Patterson or upon the Court later publishing its reasons in that case      Patterson said nothing about the validity of s       Second  as noted by the majority in Shaw  at   in Re Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte Te   HCA         CLR   four members of the High Court agreed that there was no single strain of reasoning in the majority judgments in Re Patterson which contains a binding statement of constitutional principle and that there were differing views in the majority as to what were the facts material to the decision  One of those four Justices  McHugh J  concluded that Re Patterson had no precedent value beyond its own facts  A little later  at   the majority said   That case  Re Patterson  henceforth should be regarded as authority for what it decided respecting s   of the Constitution and the constructive failure in the exercise of jurisdiction by the Minister      See too the respondents  submissions at     above    Third  the idea that Mr Coleman s detention was unlawful from   March   until the High Court handed down its decision in Shaw on   December   when the applicant effectively conceded that it thereupon became lawful  flies in the face of the principle of the retrospective operation of judicial lawmaking  so that even if Re Patterson changed the law  Shaw changed it back with retrospective operation  As Sackville J  with whom Foster and Lehane JJ agreed in Torrens Aloha Pty Ltd v Citibank NA     FCR   observed at  G     In the absence of a doctrine of prospective overruling  changes in the law offered by

some breach in bringing the deceased into detention or maintaining him in detention  if he was liable to be kept in lawful custody  as he clearly was as is clear from the judgment in Shaw   the deceased was not ever entitled to be discharged from detention but only remanded to some lawful custody  R v Bevan  Ex parte Elias and Gordon   HCA         CLR   Starke J at      That is  if Mr Robicheau personally did not  know  or  reasonably suspect  Mr Coleman was an unlawful non citizen  Mr Coleman is not entitled to pursue an action for wrongful imprisonment but could seek only to be remanded to lawful custody     The decision in Re Patterson is a decision in which the reasons of the majority do not have a single strain of reasoning and which has been described as having  had no precedent value beyond its own facts  Shaw at           Indeed  in Ruddock v Taylor   the majority indicated  at   that  in Shaw   a  majority of the Court also held at   that Patterson should be regarded as authority for what it decided respecting s   of the Constitution and the constructive failure in the exercise of jurisdiction by the Minister     That is  it should not be regarded as authoritative in deciding what the law was pertaining to identification of who are aliens  Shaw at         This is particularly telling given that there is a material factual distinction between the present case and that considered in Patterson   In that case  one member of the majority  McHugh J  posited that a British subject living in Australia at the time of the enactment of the Royal Style and Titles Act    Cth  in   was not an alien  In the present case  the deceased was not living in Australia in   but had returned to Scotland at that time for about four years after only a two year presence in Australia  Hence  it would seem even on the stated reasoning in Patterson that a majority of the Justices would have been of the view that the deceased in this case was an alien  That this conclusion was the correct result has been confirmed by the decision in Shaw      The Minister contends that there is no basis for contending that the officer who took the deceased into detention failed to hold a reasonable suspicion that the applicant was an unlawful non citizen even as the law stood in February    which is not the correct test for the reasons outlined above      The High Court decided  in Ruddock v Taylor   that it was sufficient to found a reasonable suspicion in that case  at          a  that the detaining officers had been provided with what  on its face  appeared to be a regular and effective decision of the Minister to cancel the respondent s visa  and   b  each officer had checked whether the respondent had any other visa          It did not make the detention unlawful in Ruddock v Taylor that the High Court had  in an earlier decision  quashed the cancellation  What was determinative was the power to detain in s   of the Act  That power is not based on the validity or otherwise of the cancellation decision that founds the reasonable suspicion      In the case before this Court  Mr Coleman was detained on   February   after the first respondent had cancelled his visa pursuant to s   of the Act  The evidence establishes that the officer who detained Mr Coleman  Mr Robicheau  held the view that the deceased was an unlawful non citizen  The Minister s first contention is that this view was plainly correct and  as such  Mr Robicheau relevantly knew him to be such  In any event  the evidence establishes Mr Robicheau s reasonable suspicion under s          a  first  Mr Robicheau was provided with the cancellation decision     b  second  Mr Robicheau reviewed Mr Coleman s file documents  and   c  third  Mr Robicheau formed the view that in light of the cancellation decision and the fact that he did not hold any other visas  that he was an unlawful non citizen          Once Mr Coleman s detention was lawful on   February   nothing remains of the applicant s case for a declaration and damages for false imprisonment  There is no change pleaded between   February   and   December   that would make the lawful detention unlawful     The respondents submit that the cancellation decision of the first respondent  acted upon by Mr Robicheau  resulted in the lawful detention of Mr Coleman  There is no cause of

for the respondent to establish that the proceeding are hopeless or bound to fail  s  A    The FASC should be dismissed   On the other hand  the consequence is that the FASC is to be read as if   was not there and as if   was amended so as to exclude Mr Coleman s actual detention on   February   and be confined to his continuing detention up to   December    Indeed  counsel for the applicant conceded as much  confining the pleading at   to Mr Coleman s continuing detention from   March   when Mr Coleman s brother telephoned the Department and spoke to a Ms Cecilia Cheung  informing her that his brother and the whole family first arrived in Australian in   and asking her whether she was aware of a High Court decision about British subjects not being subject to deportation  From that time on  so the argument went  Mr Coleman s continued detention until   December    when the High Court handed down its decision in Shaw   was  in the face of the decision of the High Court in Re Patterson   unlawful in that the detaining authority was  from that time on  on notice that Mr Coleman first arrived in Australia on   October   and it could no longer reasonably suspect Mr Coleman of being an unlawful non citizen   This argument has a number of hurdles in the way of raising unlawful detention to a level of being a cause of action with reasonable prospects of success      First  as Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Heydon JJ observed in Ruddock v Taylor at   a majority of the High Court in Shaw held that Re Patterson is not to be understood as overruling Nolan v Minister for Immigration   Ethnic Affairs   HCA         CLR   but even it were to be so understood      what were reasonable grounds for effecting the respondent s detention did not retrospectively cease to be reasonable upon the Court making its orders in Patterson or upon the Court later publishing its reasons in that case      Patterson said nothing about the validity of s       Second  as noted by the majority in Shaw  at   in Re Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte Te   HCA         CLR   four members of the High Court agreed that there was no single strain of reasoning in the majority judgments in Re Patterson which contains a binding statement of constitutional principle and that there were differing views in the majority as to what were the facts material to the decision  One of those four Justices  McHugh J  concluded that Re Patterson had no precedent value beyond its own facts  A little later  at   the majority said   That case  Re Patterson  henceforth should be regarded as authority for what it decided respecting s   of the Constitution and the constructive failure in the exercise of jurisdiction by the Minister      See too the respondents  submissions at     above    Third  the idea that Mr Coleman s detention was unlawful from   March   until the High Court handed down its decision in Shaw on   December   when the applicant effectively conceded that it thereupon became lawful  flies in the face of the principle of the retrospective operation of judicial lawmaking  so that even if Re Patterson changed the law  Shaw changed it back with retrospective operation  As Sackville J  with whom Foster and Lehane JJ agreed in Torrens Aloha Pty Ltd v Citibank NA     FCR   observed at  G     In the absence of a doctrine of prospective overruling  changes in the law offered by judicial decisions are not confined to events or transactions occurring after the date of the decision changing the law  Doubtless from a historical perspective  this owes a good

executrix of the estate of Gerard William Coleman who died on   March    The applicant claims Mr Coleman was falsely imprisoned in the period   February    when he was first detained  to   December    when Shaw v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   HCA         CLR   was decided by the High Court of Australia  paras   and   of the Further Amended Statement of Claim  the FASC    The background facts are not in dispute and are relevantly set out in the respondents  written submissions as follows      Mr Coleman arrived in Australia on   October   when he was   years old      On   December   Mr Coleman departed Australia      On   January   Mr Coleman returned to Australia and remained in Australia from that time onwards except for two relatively brief periods    December     January   and   June     December       On   September   Mr Coleman became the holder of a Transitional  Permanent  Visa pursuant to reg   of the Migration Reform  Transitional Provisions  Regulations       On   January   the first respondent cancelled the applicant s Transitional  Permanent  Visa pursuant to s   of the Migration Act    Cth   the Act        On   February   an officer of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  the Department  as it was then known  notified Mr Coleman that his visa had been cancelled     On   February   a delegate of the Secretary of the Department issued a search warrant to John Bernard Robicheau  an officer of the Department  pursuant to s   of the Act   The search warrant authorised Mr Robicheau to enter and search   any building  premises  vehicle  vessel or place in which you have reasonable cause to believe there may be found   a  an unlawful non citizen  a removee or deportee  within the meaning of the Act             Prior to detaining Mr Coleman  Mr Robicheau reviewed Mr Coleman s file  including the Visa Cancellation Decision record  He formed the view that Mr Coleman was an unlawful non citizen     On   February   Mr Robicheau executed the search warrant and detained Mr Coleman pursuant to s   of the Act   The applicant was taken first to Wyong Police Station and then to Villawood Immigration Detention Centre      Mr Coleman was held in Villawood Immigration Detention Centre from   February   to   August    The period of detention that is relevant to these proceedings is the period   February   to   December     The applicant s cause of action is pleaded in paras   and   of the FASC in the following terms         On and from   February   the first respondent and the second respondent did not know within the meaning of section   of the Migration Act   and had no cause to reasonably suspect that the deceased was an unlawful non citizen within the meaning of the said Act           PARTICULARS            a  The deceased was a British subject                       b  The deceased was not an alien                       c  Following Re Patterson  Ex parte Taylor   HCA         CLR   s   of the Migration Act    the Act  could not apply to the deceased                       d  There was no basis for the formation of a reasonable suspicion that the deceased was an unlawful non citizen under the Act                   The action of the first respondent and the second respondent by its representative the first respondent in causing the deceased to be detained at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre and continuing to detain him up to   December   being the date of the judgment of the High Court of Australia in Shaw v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         CLR   was                 a  Unlawful  illegal and a breach of the Migration Act   in that it failed to have regard to the fact the deceased was not an unlawful non citizen under the Act                   b  Unlawful  illegal and unreasonable for any period longer than was necessary to identify that the deceased was not an unlawful non citizen under the Act   In their written submissions  the respondents submitted that even if it were open to the applicant to establish that the cancellation decision was invalid because s   had no application to Mr Coleman following Re Patterson  Ex parte Taylor   HCA         CLR   the action for false imprisonment must fail  The submissions took the following course      In order to establish wrongful detention  the applicant must establish that the detention of Mr Coleman was beyond the power of the respondents  or their officers  and thus unlawful   The applicant submitted to the contrary that it is for the respondents to demonstrate that the detention was lawful and  although nothing turns on this in the case at hand  I think this must be correct     Section   of the Act imposes an obligation  a duty  on an officer of the Department  who  knows or reasonably suspects that a person in the migration zone      is an unlawful non citizen  to detain that person  The distinction between  knows  and  reasonably suspects  reveals that the duty to detain applies at least to the following circumstances         a  where the officer believes the person to be an unlawful non citizen and is ultimately correct in that belief  knows  and   b  where the officer believes the person to be an unlawful non citizen  ultimately is not correct about that but had reasonably grounds for the belief  reasonably suspects           In Ruddock v Taylor     CLR   the judgment of the majority shows the interplay between the objective and subjective elements at             It may be accepted that in so far as s   required  and thus authorised  the detention of those who are unlawful non citizens  a want of power to cancel a visa  or failure in lawful exercise of that power  would lead to the quashing of the decision to cancel  It would then be apparent that the person was not an unlawful non citizen and not within that aspect of the operation of s                  But that does not exhaust the operation of s    Section   is directed not only to cases where an officer knows that a person is an unlawful non citizen  it extends to cases where the officer reasonably suspects that a person has that status  It follows that demonstrating that a person is not an unlawful non citizen does not necessarily take the person beyond the reach of the obligation which s   imposes on officers  Had it been intended that those who were to be subject to detention by an officer should be confined to those who are in fact unlawful non citizens  s   would have been much simpler  The section would have read   an officer shall detain an unlawful non citizen   The reference to an officer s state of mind is explicable only if the section is understood as not confined in operation to those who are  in fact  unlawful non citizens                Emphasis in original                     This passage reveals that s   of the Act authorises and requires the detention of persons who are  at law   unlawful non citizens   However  it is not confined to such persons and extends to persons who the officer reasonably suspects to be such     In the present case  the law is now clear beyond argument that the applicant was in truth and at law an  alien  at all material times   Shaw   and  not having a valid visa  was therefore an unlawful non citizen  s   of the Act      The short answer to the applicant s case is that the officer was correct in forming the view that the deceased was an unlawful non citizen the officer relevantly  knew  him to be such  In these circumstances  the detention was authorised under s   of the Act and the applicant s present application must fail     Furthermore  even if there had been some breach in bringing the deceased into detention or maintaining him in
