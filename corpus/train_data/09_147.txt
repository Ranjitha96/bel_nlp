SZKPB v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   Another   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedNAMJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALD  The learned Federal Magistrate concluded that the Tribunal had met its obligations to afford a real hearing opportunity pursuant to s    Mr Reilly  for the Minister  very properly in the course of his submissions drew my attention to NAMJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALD    hereafter NAMJ    In that case  at paras     and   Branson J summarises the effect of earlier decisions of the Full Court in relation to the affording of a meaningful opportunity to be heard  as required by s     in circumstances where an applicant before the Tribunal is not in a fit state to take part in the hearing  The case before her Honour concerned a circumstance where it was alleged that the Tribunal did know of an asserted unfitness on the part of the applicant  but nonetheless reached a conclusion that the applicant was fit to take part in the hearing  Her Honour observed  at para   and para   page     I accept the submission of the respondent that in making a judgment as to the fitness of the applicant to take part in the hearing before the tribunal  I should accord weight to the view taken by the tribunal  The tribunal was satisfied that the applicant knew the purpose of the hearing  and had been able to give a comprehensive and lucid account of his claims  I do not consider that this assessment is rendered improbable by the conclusions that I ve reached above based on the expert evidence placed before me  It seems to me that by analogy with a claim of procedural unfairness the applicant must bear the onus of establishing that he was unfit to take part in the tribunal hearing      Her Honour then refers to authority      Having regard  particularly to the assessment of the applicant made by the tribunal member  I m not satisfied that at the time of the tribunal hearing the applicant lacked the capacity to understand the concerns relating to his claim to be entitled to a protection visa that the tribunal raised with him  including the tribunal s concern as to his credibility  Nor am I satisfied that he lacked the capacity to understand and respond to the questions put to him by the tribunal  Further  I am not satisfied that the applicant lacked the capacity to give an account of his experiences in Bangladesh  or the capacity to present arguments in support of his claim to be entitled to a protection visa  In this case the Appellants introduced no evidence  lay or professional  before the Tribunal in relation to the supposed  or the asserted  incapacity of the male Appellant  There was an assertion apparently on the part of the female Appellant  but this does not seem to have been developed in any detailed way in evidence before the Tribunal  The same applies in respect of the proceedings before the Federal Magistrates Court  and  for that matter  before this Court  Upon the appeal being called on  the male Appellant indicated that he wished the submissions in respect of the appeal to be made by the female Appellant  In NAMJ there was evidence received from a clinical social worker and a general practitioner  There is no such evidence at any stage of this case  In many cases  where a claim of an absence of compliance with s   on the part of the Tribunal is advanced  the introduction of medical evidence concerning capacity at the time of the hearing would be necessary  It is certainly possible  though  to conceive of cases where lay evidence may provide a satisfactory foundation for a conclusion as to an absence of capacity on the part of a visa applicant  The difficulty here is that there was just no evidence at all  The Tribunal made its own observation  which is recorded in the passage from which I have quoted  Against this background  and having regard to the court s decision in NAMJ   there is no error in the Federal Magistrate s conclusion that there was no violation of s    That  in one way or another  is the nature of the challenge which the Appellants advance  In my opinion  that challenge cannot  for the reasons given  succeed  The appeal is therefore dismissed    I certify that the preceding twenty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

Magistrates Court followed  This was unsuccessful  An appeal to this Court against that Federal Magistrates Court s decision did prove successful  see the judgment of Rares J  SZKPB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA    The upshot of the successful appeal to this Court came to be a rehearing of the application for review of the visa refusal decision by a differently constituted Tribunal  On   June   for reasons which it published to the Appellants under cover of a letter dated   July   the Tribunal again decided to affirm the visa refusal decision  The Appellants again sought the judicial review of that decision by the Federal Magistrates Court  On   November   for reasons delivered that day  the Federal Magistrates Court dismissed the judicial review application  It is from that court s decision that the Appellants now appeal to this Court  The grounds of appeal to this Court are as follows  The Tribunal  exceeding its jurisdiction had constructively failed to exercise its jurisdiction by failing to accept the fact that the first Appellant is suffering from intellectual and physical impairment with his memory  which prevents him from understanding the questions put to him at the hearing   The Federal Magistrates Court failed to accept the incapacity and ordered the tribunal to grant the opportunity for the first appellant to obtain medical reports to prove his incapacity   The Federal Magistrates Court and the tribunal failed to accept that the failure to produce medical evidence at the hearing does not necessarily mean that the first appellant is not suffering from physical and intellectual impairment  sic   Some reference to the basis of the claim for a protection visa is necessary  The male Appellant claimed to fear persecution in India from persons associated with the Bharatiya Janata Party  BJP  and Rashtriya Swayamsevac Sangh  RSS
