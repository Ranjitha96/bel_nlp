make a similar proclamation with respect to anything which in the opinion of the Governor General is a lighthouse is another thing   In the way it was expressed  the Commission s final determination did not adapt the provisions of Code   because it presupposed the fundamental matter that an ULLS transfer request had to determine  namely  the existence of an ULLS to transfer  This created a fundamental uncertainty both as to how the final determination should be construed and the methodology for Telstra to follow postulated in par    If the presupposition is wrong in respect of a request made by Optus  will Telstra be in breach of the final determination since it can never supply the service over the identified pathway used by the soft dial tone  Alternatively  will Telstra be entitled to reject the request in any event because the omission of essential information in the ULLS transfer request process in cl   of Code   and or cl   of Guideline    namely the ULLS identifier  entitled it to do so  Neither scenario makes the final determination certain  The presupposition takes the place of the processes in cl   of Code   without establishing that the process in par  a  can be applied to a particular line with a soft dial which is not  in fact  an ULLS  And  notwithstanding that par  a  treats every request where a soft dial tone is present as an ULLS transfer request

misconstruction or misunderstanding of the purposes of Code   and its October   determination in the sense that the Commission did not have regard the whole of to cl   as being a determination under s

parties to engage in a pointless exercise of submitting a Vacant ULLS request in circumstances where it was already known that they should be rejected  It pointed to the necessity to construe the words of par  e  in a way that gave them a practical operation consistent with the intention of the Commission  Gill     WLR at     per Lord Reid   Optus argued that the Commission was concerned to specify a practical means of identifying and connecting a particular line to a customer s premises  It said that that par  e  read together with par  a  showed that the existence of a soft dial tone indicated an existing continuous connection on a particular line from the customer s apartment with an MDU to the exchange  It contended that the practical utility of this was to enable Telstra  when provided with the other information in par  a  to identify the particular line in place and allow for connecting  jumpering  Optus  equipment to occur at the exchange without the need for technicians to visit the apartment building to connect a different pair of copper wires to the customer s premises  Optus argued that par  e  applied to situations other than those in par  a  namely that there was no soft dial tone so that it was not possible to identify an existing continuous connection   While these submissions of Optus recognised the practical operation of the final determination  they pointed to the fact that it did not operate on an ULLS connection  but rather in respect of a presupposed situation where there either was an ULLS  par  a  or there was no ULLS  par  e   That was the very difficulty of which Telstra complained  The drafting of par   was inapt to specify terms and conditions for ordering and provisioning a communications wire or ULLS in a practical or intelligible fashion  The Commission s power was conferred to enable it to regulate a declared service  such as the ULLS  not to regulate something else  The Commission s powers under Part XIC of the Act to determine access to the declared service  being the ULLS  did not extend to determining matters where no ULLS existed as contemplated in par  e   I am of opinion that the Commission exceeded its

findings on those questions of fact which it considers to be material to the decision it has made and the reasons it had for reaching that decision as explained by McHugh  Gummow and Hayne JJ in Yusuf     CLR at       The purpose of the arbitration was to determine whether Optus should be granted access to the ULLS in a manner different to its then current access  The subject matter  scope and purpose of ss  CP  and  CR d  required the Commission  in making a final determination about the subject matter of the arbitration concerning access by Optus to the declared ULLS service to have regard to the actual direct costs which Telstra would incur in providing the access to Optus as required by the final determination   The Commission accepted that there were already direct costs incurred by Telstra in providing the existing access  But  the Commission  as decision maker  had to have regard in addition to the direct cost to Telstra of effecting what it was considering as a final determination  This view is reinforced by the prohibition imposed by s  CQ f   That directs the Commission not to make a final determination for access if in doing so Telstra would be required to bear an unreasonable amount of the costs of extending or enhancing the capability of a facility  Thus  not only was the Commission required to have regard to Telstra s actual direct costs for the

so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute   I am of opinion that the requirement in s  CR d  that the Commission take into account the direct costs of providing access to the declared service in making a final determination must be read consistently with its obligation to refrain from making such a determination if  in doing so  a party would be required to bear an unreasonable amount of the costs of extending or enhancing the capability of a facility   The Commission did not set out any findings as to the direct costs of Telstra providing access to the ULLS either generally  see Reasons at   or specifically those which would be incurred by Telstra in providing the service required in the final determination  The Act required the Commission to have regard to those costs by giving them proper  genuine and realistic consideration in arriving at its final determination  A mere recitation of submissions to it and then the expression of an unreasoned conclusion  could not suffice to comply with the Commission s obligation  within the meaning of s  CR d  to have regard to Telstra s direct costs of providing access and its claim that they would be about     million  It did not have regard to Telstra s direct costs of providing the access it required under its final determination   For these reasons  I am of opinion that the final determination was uncertain both in expression and in operation  It was therefore unlawfully made  Project Blue Sky Inc     CLR at         Telstra also argued that the final determination was unreasonable in the sense provided in s  g  of the ADJR Act   namely an exercise of power that was so unreasonable that no reasonable person could so exercise the power  and that therefore  there had been an improper exercise of power   ADJR Act   s  e   Telstra argued that the final determination was illogical in the sense that it did not depend upon the Commission s evaluation of evidence or the drawing of factual inferences  It also contended that the final determination was illogical because it required the parties to the arbitration to comply with rules that were inconsistent internally with one another  This  in essence  was another way of arguing the same issues as have been discussed above   Optus argued that Telstra understood the practical

matter explicitly mentioned as a matter to be taken into account and  secondly  the scheme of the provisions was that once an approval were given  the proprietor of the nursing home was not permitted to exceed the scale of fees fixed by the decision maker   As Mason J pointed out the section did not require the decision maker there to fix the scale of fees exclusively by reference to particular costs  The decision maker was entitled to have regard  he said  to other relevant considerations  But  the function of the decision maker was to determine a scale of fees for the particular nursing home  not all nursing homes  Thus the Act directed that regard be had to the costs incurred in providing care in that nursing home  Sean Investments   CLR at     I am of opinion that when s  CR d

precision or in such a way that both Telstra and the Court can determine whether a particular request by Optus must be dealt with in a certain  identified way  cf  Herald Sun TV Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal   HCA         CLR   at   per Gibbs CJ  Mason  Wilson  Deane and Dawson JJ  Telstra contended that par   was      so vaguely expressed that either its meaning or its application is a matter of real uncertainty      and so was not      reasonably certain  using the words of Kitto J in Television Corporation Ltd v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at    Kitto J said there that the latter concept included both certainty of expression and certainty in operation   I am of opinion that par   is uncertain for the reason given by Kitto J in Television Corporation   CLR at   when he said of conditions imposed in a licence by a Minister purportedly under a statutory power to do so   After all  the power given to the Minister is to prescribe the conditions of his own authority to deprive a licensee of its licence  Is it really to be supposed that the Parliament intended that he might prescribe conditions in words of such dubious import that no one but himself would be sure how far he meant them to go  The Parliament did not give the Minister power to suspend or revoke licences at will  The course it took was to require him to describe in advance  by the formal method of imposing conditions upon a licence  what conduct of the licensee would expose the licence to suspension or revocation  I can see no justification for so loose an interpretation of the Act that a form of words which by reason of vagueness fails to perform that function may be held a condition within the intended scope of the authority   The provisions of par   of the final determination must be read as a whole  This is because the whole of par   purports to specify what Telstra must do to order and provision so as to provide access  Thus  in pars  a  and  e  the Commission equated the presence of a soft dial tone as the signification that an ULLS exists that provides the connection over which the soft dial tone is transmitted  For the reasons that I have given  that is fallacious  And because it is fallacious  but fundamental to the requirement for Telstra under par  a  to treat the request as a valid ULLS transfer request  if Optus  construction is correct  I am of opinion that the final determination is uncertain and unworkable   This view is reinforced by consideration of par  f  and  g   These deal with the situation where Optus has submitted an ULLS transfer request that meets the requirements in par  a   In the first case  Optus must accept any risk as to quality of connection      on the existing copper path between the Telstra exchange and the end user premises   emphasis added   Again  this demonstrates the Commission presupposed that in every case the presence of a soft dial tone identified the existence of a copper path  What is Telstra to do if that assumption is  as it can be  incorrect  It cannot supply the service the subject of the request as an ULLS service because  even though the soft dial tone is transmitted by the path that exists  that path is not an ULLS path  And  if Optus and the Commission are correct  Telstra cannot reject the transfer request but must treat it as valid even though it does not relate to an ULLS  That is  the final determination commits Telstra to processing as an ULLS transfer request  a request based on no more than the existence of a soft dial tone and the provision of a telephone number to Optus  new subscriber s address referred toTelstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Here  s  CR  prescribes a number of matters for consideration  This is a sure legislative indication that these matters must be central matters for the Commission  But  because s  CR  expressly widens the range of matters which the Commission may consider  it is authorised to arrive at a final determination  after due consideration  which accords more weight to some other factor or factors than those in s  CR   Indeed  the factors in s  CR  itself tend in different directions  The interests of a carrier  s  CR b  and those of all persons who have a right to use a declared service  s  CR c  more often than not will be opposed  If the Commission were to give fundamental weight to each in the sense which Telstra argued  how could it arrive at a decision favouring one at the expense of the other  cf Telstra Corporation Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCA   at       per Lindgren J   In Telstra   FCA   at   Lindgren J held that s  CR a  is the factor which should be given fundamental weight  namely  whether the determination will promote the long term interests of end users of services supplied by means of carriage services  This was because  he held  that factor reflected the sole object of Part XIC of the Act as expressed in s  AB  see Telstra   FCA   at     Of course  s  AB e  supplements this concept by identifying an objective of encouraging the economically efficient use of  and economically efficient investment in  the infrastructure by which listed services are supplied  Often that objective may not be attained if an infrastructure investment is not economically feasible for the service provider to make or support  So  by dint of s  AB e  the interests of end users may well include that the service provider is not forced to act in a way which for it is economically unjustifiable  Possibly  a monopolist may be able to be forced to lower prices or make way for competition under s  AB e  but not to run the business as a charitable exercise or at a loss   Therefore  depending on the facts of a particular arbitration  one or more of the matters in s  CR  may become of greater or lesser weight in the decision making process  However  as a matter of law  none of the factors  including s  CR d  is entitled to a fixed weighting in that process regardless of the subject matter of any arbitration and all other relevant factors  Peko Wallsend   CLR at   per Mason J  Foster   CLR at       per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J  cf  Telstra   FCA   at   per Lindgren J citedTelstra Corporation Ltd v The Commonwealth     ALR       HCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Many MDUs have a main distribution frame  MDF   The MDF is used to connect the telephony wires of dwellings within the MDU to appropriate wires that  in turn  connect to a telephone exchange  A form of connection is by use of a copper or aluminium wire  which  as explained below  is defined as a  communications wire   One  but by no means the exclusive  means of connection between the exchange side of the MDF and the exchange itself is through an unconditioned communications wire  This form of communication is called an unconditioned local loop service  ULLS   Telstra Corporation Limited owns and maintains those local loops  It also owns over   local exchanges as explained in Telstra Corporation Ltd v The Commonwealth   HCA         ALR   at           per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne  Heydon  Crennan and Kiefel JJ   The essential and defining characteristics of the ULLS are that it consists of an unconditioned communications wire  usually a twisted pair of copper or aluminium wires  between  in substance  the exchange side of the MDF and the telephone exchange itself  However  there are other means of connecting between the exchange side of the MDF and the telephone exchange  including using fibre optic cable  Thus  the mere fact that there may be wires physically present at the exchange side of the MDU does not mean that the whole path to the exchange from that wire will always be physically along a copper or aluminium communications wire or wires   Other telecommunications providers

Board  Ex parte Melbourne Stevedoring Co Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at    There  Dixon CJ  Williams  Webb and Fullagar JJ referred to the important distinction between a mere insufficiency of evidence or other materials to support a conclusion of fact when the function of finding the fact has been committed to a person or body by the Parliament and  on the other hand  the absence of any foundation in fact for the fulfilment of the conditions upon which  in point of law  the existence of the power depends  They said that it was not enough if the repository of the power  properly interpreting the section of the Act under which it was conferred and applying the correct test         nevertheless satisfies itself or himself on inadequate material that facts exist which in truth would fulfil the conditions which one or other or both of those paragraphs prescribe  The inadequacy of the material is not in itself a ground for prohibition  But it is a circumstance which may support the inference that the tribunal is applying the wrong test or is not in reality satisfied of the requisite matters  If there are other indications that this is so or that the purpose of the function committed to the tribunal is misconceived it is but a short step to the conclusion that in truth the power has not arisen because the conditions for its exercise do not exist in law and in fact   As McHugh and Gummow JJ identified in S    ALR at     the principle in Melbourne Stevedoring   CLR at   does not depend upon unreasonableness but upon the absence of a factual basis in which the power could be exercised  For the reasons that I have given above  in reality  the Commission was not satisfied of the requisite matters upon which its power to make the final determination depended  namely  it acted on the misconception that the presence of a soft dial tone demonstrated the existence of an unconditioned communications wire or ULLS  This was because of its misunderstandings of the subject matter with which it purported to deal  that I have described  The Commission s determination was therefore unreasonable and an improper exercise of power followedThe Queen v Toohey  Ex parte Meneling Station Pty Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I am of opinion that when s  CR d  required the Commission  in making a final determination  to take into account Telstra s direct costs of providing access to the ULLS in the manner the Commission proposed  it was required to take that matter into account  together with the other matters referred to in the section  and to give weight to them as a fundamental element in making its decision  The Queen v Toohey  Ex parte Meneling Station Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at   per Gibbs CJ applying what Mason J had said in Sean Investments   CLR at   to a section requiring a decision maker to take a variety of matters into account  Mason J said that the requirement to have regard to a matter meant that it would become a central element for the decision maker in his considerations  Meneling Station   CLR at    And  as he later explained in his classic judgment in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   in the absence of any statutory indication of the weight to be given to various considerations  it is generally for the decision maker and not the Court to determine the appropriate weight to be given to the matters which are required to be taken into account in exercising a statutory power  Mason J said that the Court could set aside an administrative decision which had failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance  or had given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no great importance  but the preferred ground on which that power was to be exercised was that the decision was  manifestly unreasonable   A person entrusted with a discretion must call his own attention to the matters which he is bound to consider  Peko Wallsend   CLR at   per Mason J applying Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corp     KB   at   per Lord Greene MR   I am of opinion that the sense in which the High Court used the expression  fundamental weight  in this context is to require the decision maker to treat the consideration of the factors  as opposed to the factors themselves  as a central element in the deliberative process  Meneling Station   CLR at   per Mason J  In this way the decision maker will give appropriate weight to those factors  The Parliament sought to ensure that the Commission would give proper  genuine and realistic consideration to each of the factors it specified in s  CR  but without confining it to those matters  as s  CR  showed  Such consideration must be reflected in the Commission s reasons for its decision citedTobacco Institute of Australia v National Health   Medical Research Council     FCR   A decision maker must give proper  genuine and

fundamental precept of constitutional law  When legislative power is used to create rights or impose liabilities and obligations  one consequence is that the freedom of those affected by the legislation is constrained or expanded by what the law provides  Where the law requires the executive branch of government  such as the Commission  to do something to give effect to the intention of the Parliament  the executive must obey the law  just like every other member of the community  be it a corporation or individual  This is because it is the duty of the executive branch of government to obey the law as laid down by the Parliament and the Courts  even if the executive does not agree with those decisions  The Commonwealth v New South Wales   HCA         CLR   at   per Isaacs  Rich

Tamberlin J admitted evidence of this kind in judicial review proceedings so that the Court was in the position to understand the particular meaning of words used in the specialised area concerned  He applied what Street J had earlier held in Ancher  Mortlock  Murray   Woolley Pty Ltd v Hooker Homes Pty Ltd     NSWLR   at   that an argumentative process between experts enables the Court to proceed
