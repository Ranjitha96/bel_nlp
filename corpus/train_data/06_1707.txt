Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Ltd  ACN     v Global Gaming Supplies Pty Ltd  ACN         FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAnton Piller KG v Manufacturing Process Ltd   EWCA Civ       Ch   Moreover  it seems to me that the approach proposed by the respondents is not consistent with the usual practice which applies to search orders  The terms of O  B of the Federal Court Rules are to be considered in light of the practice which evolved in the years following the decision in Anton Piller KG v Manufacturing Process Ltd   EWCA Civ       Ch     Prior to the advent of the computer era  the practice was for a physical search to be conducted at the premises  Questions of relevance were not an issue  although provision was always made for the protection of material claimed to be privileged or confidential  The computer imaging which now takes place seems to me to be the equivalent of what Mr Cobden SC for the applicants called the  flick through  which took place in the searched premises in the days when only hard copy documents and other physical materials were the subject of searches   I accept that the effect of the modern regime of computer imaging as applied in the present case is to grant an applicant a far more leisurely period in which to examine the seized materials than was previously available  This will be a particular concern where the seized materials are obtained from a trade competitor as has happened in the present case  This emphasises the draconian and exceptional nature of the remedy   However  in order to obtain a search order an applicant must satisfy the stringent conditions laid down in O  B r    As I have already noted  Allsop J was satisfied that the necessary conditions were met  His Honour was also satisfied that the search should not be limited to the precise cause of action known to the applicants when the search order was obtained citedHome Office v Harman     AC   Order   provides for the respondents to file and serve affidavits setting out the nature and basis of any claim for privilege or confidentiality  Order   provides in effect for a complete release of the obligations arising from the principle in Home Office v Harman     AC     On   October   the computer experts prepared a report in accordance with Order    They stated that  in accordance with Order   they performed an independent analysis of the forensic images and extracted certain files from the images based upon the search regime  They stated that the results have been saved to a series of spreadsheets accompanying the report   The computer experts  report was not provided to the solicitors for the respondents until   October   and the relevant files  Extracted Files  referred to therein were only made available for inspection on   November    The solicitors inspected the Extracted Files and determined that there are approximately   electronic files in some   folders  and approximately   emails  Plainly the work involved in the search of that material to determine the existence of privileged or confidential material is significant   With one exception  I am not satisfied that there are sufficient changed circumstances to warrant any amendments to the orders made on   September    The exception is that the Home Office v Harman exemption  which is contained in Order   ought in my view to be deleted  In many instances such an exemption may be appropriate  but in the circumstances of the present case where the known infringement consisted of the sale of a limited number of gaming machines in Peru in     I do not think that the terms of Order   should be maintained  It seems to me to be contrary to the interests of justice in the case for them to remain as part of the court orders  It follows that I will make orders in terms of those that have been provided to me by senior counsel for the applicants     I certify that the preceding thirty four   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson J    Associate Dated    November   Counsel for the Applicants  R Cobden SC with N Murray     Solicitor for the Applicants  Baker   McKenzie     Counsel for the Respondents  J Ireland QC with M Green     Solicitor for the Respondents  Paul Bard Lawyers     Date of Hearing    November       Date of Judgment    November           AustLII  Copyright Policy   Disclaimers   Privacy Policy   Feedback   URL  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html
