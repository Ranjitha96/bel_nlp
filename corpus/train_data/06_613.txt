applicant seeks the final report of the inspector in order to determine whether an action on this ground in fact lies consideredConway v Rimmer and Anor   UKHL       AC   There is a tension between the public interest in disclosing documents which may assist a party in enforcing its legal rights and the public interest in keeping documents of a certain nature confidential  As Lord Upjohn stated in Conway v Rimmer and Anor   UKHL       AC   at      On the one side there is the public interest to be protected  on the other side of the scales is the interest of the subject who legitimately wants production of some documents which he believes will support his own or defeat his adversary s case  Both are matters of public interest  for it is also in the public interest that justice should be done between litigating parties by production of all documents which are relevant and for which privilege cannot be claimed under the ordinary rules  They must be weighed in the balance one against the other  referred toGull Petroleum  WA  Ltd v Tah Land Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The applicant submits that the entirety of the draft reports is required in order to consider whether he has a basis to allege that APRA treated him inconsistently  I accept that the draft reports may be relevant to the question of any ultimate claim against APRA  should such a claim be brought  but those reports are not properly the subject of a notice to produce brought in proceedings under O  A r    The requirements of O  A r   are not particularly stringent  see

possess sufficient factual material to substantiate O  A r  a  then the deficiency cannot be rectified by seeking production of material from a respondent before the preliminary discovery application is heard distinguishedHarris v Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Ors     ALR   There was one further consideration raised by APRA which I consider to be significant  APRA submitted that the public interest in non disclosure was heightened when the report was in draft form  and referred to the decision of Beaumont J in Harris v Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Ors     ALR    That case involved interim reports prepared in the course of an investigation into the legal department of the Australian Broadcasting Commission  An application was made under the Freedom of Information Act for the release of the interim reports prepared by the investigator  At the time the application was made  the final report had not been completed  His Honour was required to decide whether the public interest required that the interim reports remain confidential and observed at      Given that the public interest is not a static concept  in my opinion  full disclosure of the reports  at this stage  would  on balance  be contrary to the public interest  The unchallenged evidence is that  in submitting her  interim  reports  Miss Pearlman did not seek information or comment from the applicant  No doubt  this course was adopted for sound practical reasons  presumably in the interests of expedition  But an incomplete inquiry conducted on such a limited footing could only lead to the formation  at that point  of views or opinions of a tentative or provisional kind  cf Blackshaw v Lord     WLR   at    However  publication of such views or opinions  provisional as they may be  could create a misleading  perhaps unfair  impression in the minds of readers who do not have the benefit  if there be any  of knowing the response of the applicant  The formation of such impressions in the public mind could  in turn  influence the decision makers in their review of the situation   The considerations which arise in evaluating the public interest in a freedom of information application may be different from those in a claim of public interest immunity  The interest in a freedom of information application is that of the public generally in being able to gain access to government documents and in transparent governance more broadly  whereas a litigant opposing a public interest immunity claim has a specific and significant interest in obtaining documents relevant to his or her claim  Nonetheless  the considerations are likely to be similar   In Harris   Beaumont J found that it was not in the public interest to release draft reports where the final report had not been completed  because of the potential of the draft reports in isolation to mislead  His Honour was concerned that the release of details before the conclusion of the investigation may influence the minds of the decision makers in their review of the matter   That is not the situation in the present proceedings  Although it has not been released  the final report has been completed and has been in the possession of APRA since   July   that is  a period of almost a year  ASIC has already determined that it does not wish to pursue any criminal prosecutions  As recorded in the letter of the Attorney General forwarded to APRA on   November   the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions did not have any objections to the reports being released to ZFS and ZAI  In respect of APRA  although it is continuing to review its position with respect to potential action which it may take against individuals  I am not able to determine  at this stage  that the release of the entirety of the draft reports to the applicant would materially influence APRA s future conduct   It is true that a person reading the draft reports may be misled or may come to conclusions about individuals named in the reports which are unfair unless the totality of the evidence included in the final report is known  But in my opinion  mere unfairness to a party named in the draft report should not  without more  be a reason to declare it subject to public interest immunity and thereby deprive a litigant of a document which is relevant to proceedings which he wishes to pursue referred toMinister

privilege of the executive government  to decide whether a document will be produced or withheld  see Sankey v Whitlam at    An objection may be taken to the production of a document because it would be against the public interest to disclose its contents  or because the document belongs to a class of documents which  in the public interest  ought not be produced  see Sankey v Whitlam at    The category of documents to which the  class  rule applies is relatively narrow  and includes documents such as cabinet minutes and documents which relate to the framing of government policy at a high level  see Sankey v Whitlam at    The claim in the present case is made on the basis of the contents of the draft reports  and not on the basis that the draft reports are a class to which public

Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd and Anor     ALR   There could be no dispute that APRA possesses the documents in question and accordingly par  c  of O  A r   is satisfied  As to par  b  of O  A r   it seems unlikely that APRA will dispute that production of the final report would be necessary for the applicant to decide whether to bring proceedings  see Hely J in St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia

affidavit of   December   which accompanied the application  The affidavit describes the course of APRA s investigation as it related to the applicant and to the facts which he believes indicated differential treatment of him by the inspector   APRA has indicated in its written submissions that it intends to dispute that there is a reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief from APRA in this Court  It has indicated that such challenge will be made because the final report  by virtue of the confidentiality provisions in the APRA Act  is only available to the inspector  APRA  ASIC  the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General  see s  a  and the definition of   financial sector supervisory agency   in s   of the APRA Act

application for preliminary discovery are narrow in scope  The primary question to be answered is whether pars  a   b  and  c  of O  A r   of the Federal Court Rules are satisfied  In Tyco Australia Pty Ltd v Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR   the Full Court of the Federal Court held that in limited circumstances a notice to produce could be issued under O   r   of the Federal Court Rules in relation to an application for preliminary discovery under O  A r    In those proceedings  Hill J  with whom Hely and Conti JJ agreed  held that a notice to produce could be issued where there was a factual dispute related to one of the requirements of a preliminary discovery application under O  A r    His Honour gave the example of a respondent who wished to call into question whether an applicant had made reasonable enquiries  as required by O  A r  b   His Honour cautioned  however  at      An applicant who seeks to use a notice to produce  in effect  to gain production of the very documents which are the subject of the pre action discovery will not have given the notice to produce in good faith  but rather  will have acted in a way that is an abuse of process  referred toYoung v Quin     FCR   A Court will not order the production of a document  even if relevant and admissible  if it would be injurious to the public interest to disclose it  see Alister and

Commission and Ors     FCR   Spargos Mining NL   Anor v Standard Chartered Aust Ltd   Ors  No       ASCR   at    The very restriction on the release of the final report without approval by the Attorney General under s   suggests that reports of this nature may well contain information which  in the public interest  should not be disclosed   However  in an application such as this  the Court must be satisfied that the specific documents sought by the applicant contain information of that nature  In Zarro Lockhart J observed at        In these days with large government instrumentalities and agencies involved in time consuming and extensive investigations into possible irregularities and offences  great care is required by the bodies themselves in ensuring both that the correct person within the structure of the organisation  that is  a person who knows the facts  has seen the documents and who is preferably at a high level within the organisation  swears the appropriate affidavit claiming public interest immunity and that the claim is not made too widely so as to sweep within its net documents that are not legitimately an essential integer in the investigative process  This also calls for vigilance by the courts lest documents are shielded from public scrutiny or inspection by parties to litigation under an unduly broad umbrella of public interest immunity   In the present matter the final version of the report may be released in the future to ZFS and ZAI  under s   of the Insurance Act   as well as being publicly released  under s    In addition  if proceedings are in the future brought against the applicant  then pursuant to s   the Court may order that he be provided with a copy of the final report   It is therefore anticipated by the Insurance Act that in some circumstances a report of this nature will be made public or at least be provided to bodies outside of APRA  Accordingly  it must be anticipated that a report will not necessarily contain information which it is not in the public interest to reveal  even if the conduct of an investigation may require that its release be delayed  If such considerations apply to a final report  they may also apply to a draft report   It is possible that the draft reports could contain material which falls into a category which usually attracts public interest immunity  but it is by no means certain  In these circumstances  before they would attract public interest immunity  I would need to be satisfied that these specific draft reports contain information which should not be released  because they identify informers  contain confidential information  because their release would prejudice ongoing investigations or legal proceedings or on some other basis   The evidence provided by APRA does not contain details to this effect  but rather talks generally of the public interest in maintaining confidentiality of draft reports of APRA  It does not refer in any way to the specific basis on which the contents of these draft reports attract public interest immunity  Mr McKenzie Craig s affidavit states generally that the release of draft findings of APRA   could lead to tailoring or tainting of evidence  concealment of documents  or other conduct which diverts  hampers or even misleads APRA or the Inspector in the investigation    However  the affidavit does not indicate why the release of the specific information contained in the draft reports would have this effect  Given that the final report has now been completed and those parts of the document which are referable to the applicant have already been provided to him  it is not immediately obvious that  if the reports were released for the limited purpose of these proceedings  APRA s investigations would be prejudiced  It appears that the evidence gathering stage of the investigation is wholly completed and the decision is now a forensic and or legal one
