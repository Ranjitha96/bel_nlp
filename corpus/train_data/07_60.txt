HCA  html  As best I can understand the claim that Mr Cirillo seeks now to make it is not revealed in his Statement of Claim it is that in defending the application he made for an inquiry as to damages  CAL  seemingly with the knowledge of the other respondents  sought to avail of a ground of defence not open to it in consequence of the  Packer agreement  that defence  which never had to be considered given the answers to the preliminary questions  was one not open to CAL and yet it is said to have added very significantly to the costs incurred by Mr Cirillo in prosecuting his application  the respondents allegedly abused the processes of the court in this and in a way  unspecified  that gives rise to the tort of abuse of process  cf Williams v Spautz   HCA         CLR     It is unnecessary for me to speculate further about such a possible claim because there is  in my view  an insuperable obstacle to it as the chronology reveals citedSiminton v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The order for costs of   made by Olsson AJ involved a determination of the rights and liabilities of the parties to the inquiry application in respect of the costs of and incidental to that application that were incurred by them  Mr Cirillo has not sought to have this order set aside  In consequence it stands as a valid and conclusive order of a superior court of record unless and until it is set aside  see Siminton v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority   FCAFC   at          As best I can understand the changing picture presented by counsel for Mr Cirillo in submissions it has no reflection in the present pleadings the damages claimed for the proposed tort of abuse of process include  it would seem  at least that part of his own solicitor and client costs in the inquiry as to damages which were incurred in consequence of the conduct of the respondents alleged to give rise to the tort  I am uncertain what else the damages would include although it again seems likely that  as in the present application  Mr Cirillo would also be attempting to be relieved indirectly of the obligation to pay some  or part of  the monies he has been ordered to pay under the consent order citedChamberlain v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Nonetheless  as I have noted  the consent order as to costs determined the incidence of costs as between Mr Cirillo and the first to fourth respondents in respect of all issues of costs in the inquiry as to damages application  For Mr Cirillo to make the claim he now foreshadows without first seeking to have that costs order set aside constitutes  in my view  an indirect challenge to the costs

involves a form of collateral attack on the order made distinguishedHanrahan v Ainsworth     NSWLR   Counsel for Mr Cirillo has sought to avoid this conclusion by relying on the decision of Hunt J in Hanrahan v Ainsworth     NSWLR   where His Honour refused to strike out an action for abuse of process in which costs and expenses associated with an earlier instituted proceeding against the now plaintiff by the now defendant were held to be recoverable in the latter proceeding if proved   That case is clearly distinguishable from the present  The earlier proceeding had never been set down for trial and in consequence no costs order had been made in it  In consequence  no issue of res judicata or of collateral attack on a final order arose in that case   For the above reasons  I am satisfied that the application should be dismissed as against the first to the fourth respondents citedR v Balfour  Ex parte Parkes Rural Distributions Pty Ltd     FCR   In relation to Finlaysons  motion  I am equally satisfied that to allow the application to remain on foot would in the circumstances be manifestly unfair to that firm and would itself constitute an abuse of process  The foreshadowed claim would in substance be seeking  amongst other things  to reverse the effect of the consent order and the agreement underpinning it  cf R v Balfour  Ex parte Parkes Rural Distributions Pty Ltd     FCR   at    If successful it would result in a judgment that conflicted with Olsson AJ s consent order   I have considered the proposed claim notwithstanding the opaque manner in which it has come forth in the course of the hearing before me  I would dismiss the application against all five respondents for the reasons I have given   However  I would in any event dismiss the application without attempting to divine what the proposed claim might comprehend and for this reason  the present application and Statement of Claim are so removed from the type of claim proposed and are so vexatious in character  as to constitute an entirely inappropriate vehicle for possibly giving life to that claim
