Aktiebolaget H ssle v Alphapharm Pty Ltd   HCA         ALR   at   in these terms     Once an invention has been made it is generally possible to postulate a combination of steps by which the inventor might have arrived at the invention that he claims in his specification if he started from something that was already known  But it is only because the invention has been made and has proved successful that it is possible to postulate from what starting point and by what particular combination of steps the inventor could have arrived at his invention  It may be that taken in isolation none of the steps which it is now possible to postulate  if taken in isolation  appears to call for any inventive ingenuity  It is improbable that this reconstruction a posteriori represents the mental process by which the inventor in fact arrived at his invention  but  even if it were  inventive ingenuity lay in perceiving that the final result which it was the object of the inventor to achieve was attainable from the particular starting point and in his selection of the particular combination of steps which would lead to that result citedKimberly Clark Australia Pty Ltd v Arico

    CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The respondents say there was a lack of fair basis in the present case because the specifications of the patents in suit do not provide real and reasonably clear disclosure of the invention  The relevant principles as to fair basis were set out in Lockwood Security Products Pty Limited v Doric Products Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at  ff   I do not accept this submission of the respondents  For reasons given above  I consider the disclosure is not limited to a rigid lock which operates as a  shear  member  Rather  it includes a lock with an adjustment assembly which in fact operates in the way claimed  Accordingly  the specification provides a sufficient disclosure for the adjustment assembly in the terms of the claim   I direct the parties to consult with a view to agreeing upon and sending to my Associate in chambers Short Minutes of Order giving effect to the above reasons  If the parties are unable to agree  they are to send to my Associate in chambers competing Short Minutes of Order with brief reasons consideredLockwood Security Products Pty Limited v Doric Products Pty Limited  No      HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The issue of obviousness which arises in this case is whether a hypothetical person skilled in the relevant art in light of the common general knowledge as at   November   would have regarded it as obvious  in the production of an improved wear assembly  to utilise a screw as a means of eliminating looseness in the wear assembly and thereby arrive at the claimed invention in Jones III  see s   of the Act   Lockwood Security Products Pty Limited v Doric Products Pty Limited  No      HCA         ALR   at    When addressing this question  the Court must be careful not to substitute its own deduction or perception for that of the hypothetical person  Furthermore  as the High Court has stated on several occasions   a  scintilla of invention remains sufficient in Australian law to support the validity of a patent  see Lockwood   ALR at   and cases cited therein   The applicants contend that the person skilled in the relevant art in this case is someone who works in the earthmoving industries who would be involved in the design and manufacture of wear assemblies and therefore would be familiar with factors relevant to their design and development  It is said by the applicants that Professor Wightley is not a person skilled in the relevant art because he had no experience in the design  operation or manufacture of wear assemblies attached specifically to excavators   The respondents  contention is that only Professor Wightley and Messrs Meyers  Ashworth and McClanahan are persons skilled in the relevant art  It is said that Professor Wightley is a mechanical engineer with extensive experience in design and manufacture of replacement wear parts for use in the mining industry generally  Mr Meyers is a mechanical engineer with experience in the design  manufacture  sale and maintenance of replaceable wear parts for excavators  and Messrs Ashworth and McClanahan are relevantly skilled mechanical engineers  On the other hand  say the respondents  Mr Alden  the expert called by the applicants  is a structural engineer  which means he is not skilled in the relevant art  In addition  the respondents argue that the only witness called by the applicants on the issue of obviousness was Mr McClanahan  the co inventor of the patents  and that the evidence called by the respondents in relation to this point was therefore not directly challenged by any qualified expert   In my opinion  Professor Wightley and the other mechanical engineers whose evidence was adduced by the respondents have sufficient expertise to express the opinions as persons skilled in the art  However  for reasons given below  I do not accept Professor Wightley s evidence and the respondents  submission that the solution provided by the invention in Jones II and Jones III was obvious   The applicants say that the invention in this case is an improved wear assembly which is constituted by the combination of elements set out in claims   and   of Jones II and claim   of Jones III  Each of these claims in suit  it is said  involves a combination of elements in a way that constitutes a new inventive thing  despite the fact that each of the elements  other than the lock adjustment assembly  was contained in the Toplok shroud  which the applicants  properly acknowledged formed part of the common general knowledge  In simpler terms  the new combination achieved by the patents in this case provided a new benefit beyond what had previously been provided  and was therefore inventive   The applicants submit that the invention the subject of Jones II and Jones III was based on perceptions that    the Toplok shroud provided a good foundation upon which to develop an improved wear assembly that could serve not only as a shroud but also as an adapter    the forces to which an adapter may be exposed could produce looseness in mounting of the wear assembly to a Toplok style of mounting  and    this looseness could be overcome by an adjustment assembly that moved the relative positions of the bearing surfaces of the Toplok style lock so as to pull the wear assembly over the mount   The applicants  argument is that the use of this type of adapter with a Toplok style of mounting was not part of the common general knowledge at the relevant date  Furthermore  the applicants say that  since there were at the relevant date many wear assemblies available to be used as the starting point to develop an improved assembly which overcame looseness between the wear member and the boss  the use of Toplok as the starting point was not required by any design principle  and was therefore not obvious  Indeed  as Professor Wightley acknowledged in cross examination  even if an inventor were confined to the Toplok shroud as a starting point  there were several other locking methods known which may have been used instead of the method ultimately used in the invention  One such alternative method was the use of two piece pins  wedges and spools to take up any looseness in the wear assembly consideredMeyers Taylor Pty Ltd v Vicarr Industries Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The dangers inherent in drawing conclusions with the benefit of hindsight have been emphasised in the authorities  As Aickin J pointed out in Meyers Taylor Pty Ltd v Vicarr Industries Ltd   HCA         CLR   at          subsequent analysis of an invention  the dissection of the invention  is not often helpful in resolving the question of obviousness  It has been criticized as being a mistaken approach  see Blanco White  Patents for Inventions     th ed    at par      This matter was also discussed by Menzies J in Commonwealth Industrial Gases Ltd  v M W A  Holdings Pty  Ltd  where he commented on the undesirability of analysis by hindsight because once one sees an invention it may very often appear very simple and one may then wonder why no one previously had thought of so simple
