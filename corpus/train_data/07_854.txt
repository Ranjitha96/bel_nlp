Applicant S  of   v Minister for Immigrationand Citizenship   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedCamden v Commissioners of Inland Revenue     KB   I see no reason to doubt that the Macquarie Dictionary is  a document the authority of which cannot reasonably be questioned  within the meaning of s    Judges regularly refer to authoritative dictionaries such as the Macquarie Dictionary for the purpose of determining or confirming the meaning of English words  Indeed  the common law rule is that evidence is not admissible for the purpose of interpreting ordinary English words   Camden v Commissioners of Inland Revenue     KB   Cross on Evidence     th Australian Edition at    It is unnecessary to give consideration here to whether this rule has survived the enactment of the Evidence Act    It was open to the Federal Magistrate to refer to the above definitions  It goes without saying that it has always been open to the Minister s legal representatives to refer to them   The above definitions of  Sindh  and  Sindhi  confirm that an assertion by a citizen of India that he is a Sindhi is an assertion of geographic significance  it is a statement that his  or his family s  geographic origin is in Sindh province which now forms part of Pakistan  The above definition of  caste  confirms that an assertion by a Hindu that he is of a particular caste is an assertion of social significance  it is a statement as to the social class into which  as a Hindu  he was born  The Tribunal plainly understood that the appellant claimed to be of the Dalit caste and that Dalit is a low caste citedCDJ v VAJ   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Order   r   of the Federal Court Rules   subject to any dispensation from compliance  see O

cases cth HCA  html  In the circumstances the Tribunal was required to determine whether low caste Hindus  ie Dalits  were capable of constituting a social group for the purposes of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees   as amended by the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees    together  the Convention   If it answered that question affirmatively  it was required to determine whether the appellant was a member of that social group  If it answered that question affirmatively  it had then to deal with the questions whether the appellant feared persecution if he returned to India  whether his fear was well founded and whether his fear was by reason of his membership of the social group constituted by Dalits   Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         ALR   per Gummow and Callinan JJ  with whom Hayne J agreed  at     The reasons for decision of the Tribunal reveal that it did not follow the above process of reasoning  Rather it either accepted or assumed that the appellant was a member of a social group for the purposes of the Convention  It seems that the social group that it had in mind was either constituted by  or included in its membership  both Sindhis and Dalits as it proceeded on the basis that it was essentially the same to be a Sindhi and a Dalit  It then had regard to information concerning the treatment in India of members of the Sindhi community  including information which suggested that  generally speaking  the Sindhi community in Maharashtra State is not ill treated  It thereafter noted  and apparently accepted  an Amnesty International report that Dalits  are routinely subjected to beatings  mutilation  murder  rape  and destruction of property    It then concluded  consistently with its assumption that it was essentially the same to be a Sindhi and a Dalit  that it was     not satisfied that being low caste  Dalit and Sindhi  without more  means that there is a real chance of the  appellant  being persecuted as contemplated by the Convention  by the Shiv Sena  and or the Indian authorities  and or upper caste people   In my view  it is plain that because the Tribunal proceeded on the basis that it was essentially the same to be a Sindhi and a Dalit  it took into account material concerning the treatment in India of Sindhis when determining whether the appellant had a well founded fear of persecution for reason of his membership of a particular social group  In doing so the Tribunal misunderstood and failed properly to deal with the claim advanced by the appellant  The social group of which the appellant is to be understood to have claimed membership was constituted by Dalits only  it did not include all Sindhis  Dalits and Sindhis are not the same and  as I have concluded above  the appellant did not assert that they are the same  In proceeding as it did the Tribunal constructively failed to exercise its jurisdiction because it did not address the claim advanced by the appellant   Dranichnikov   ALR at       In retrospect it can be seen that both the Minister and the appellant could have provided greater assistance to the Federal Magistrate  His Honour would almost certainly have benefited from evidence of the kind now contained in the affidavit of Professor Jayaraman  However  more informal ways of clarifying the meaning of the terms Sindhi and Dalit were open to the parties   For the reasons outlined above his Honour erred in concluding that the Tribunal addressed the claim advanced by the appellant  The first ground of appeal is made out   The second ground of appeal is properly understood  it seems to me  as an alternate ground to the first ground of appeal  On the assumption  which is contrary to my finding  that the Tribunal did recognise that being a Sindhi and being a Dalit was not essentially the same  it made no finding as to why  having regard to the Amnesty International report which it apparently accepted  the appellant did not have a well founded fear of persecution as a member of the social group constituted by Dalits  The explanation for its apparent failure to apply the real chance test in this regard is to be found  in my view  in its failure to distinguish between the two social groups  Sindhis and Dalits   The appeal will be allowed and the orders made by the Federal Magistrates Court on   January   set aside  In lieu thereof it will be ordered that orders issue in the nature of certiorari quashing the decision of the Tribunal and in the nature of mandamus requiring the Tribunal to determine the appellant s application for review of the decision of the delegate of the Minister according to law  The first respondent will be ordered to pay the appellant s costs in the
