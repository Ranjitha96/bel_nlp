who gave an opinion of percentages of incapacity which are mentioned in the report of   June    Dr Reddan took account of the alcohol condition as well as the personality disorder condition in providing her opinion  These percentages are driver  minimal     which Dr Reddan conceded could be increased to   mobile plant operator  minimal    labourer  minimal    storeman  minimal    mining and

the levels of incapacity for security officer and foreman  evidence of Dr Reddan in relation to both kinds of employment indicating   incapacity   In my view this submission raises a serious question as to whether the Tribunal actually did take into consideration evidence before it of the levels of incapacity of Mr House in relation to all kinds of employment listed  and not merely the levels of incapacity in relation to security officer and foreman  The fact that  in relation to the other seven kinds of civil employment listed  the evidence accepted by the Tribunal was that Mr House s incapacity ranged from   to   means that the finding by the Tribunal of   incapacity warrants some explanation of the process of reasoning  Unfortunately  in my view such explanation as there is in

Authority s appeal the appropriate course is for the Court to remit the matter to the Tribunal as the arbiter of fact  Consideration  First ground of appeal It is clear on reading the decision of Emmett FM in House   FMCA   that the issue of Mr House s personality disorder had been raised in the proceedings both before the Tribunal in its   proceedings and in the Federal Magistrates Court  In this context it is useful to set out comments by her Honour in House   FMCA   with respect to this issue     New grounds of Appeal        The Appellant argued orally that the Tribunal had further erred     a  in seeking to separate his personality disorder from his alcoholism and thereby discount by half the assessment of the Appellant s impairment in circumstances where that exercise had not been undertaken in any prior determination     b  in failing to find that the Appellant s personality disorder had been part of the reason for his discharge from the Armed Forces in May   and therefore part of the physical or mental incapacity for which he was retired and therefore not able to be separated or discounted from his alcoholism  and     c  in that the Tribunal s finding that the Appellant s alcoholism and personality disorder could be separated such that the percentage of the incapacity from impairment that was a cause of his retirement was halved was a finding so repugnant to the evidence as to amount to an error of law          Leave was then sought by the Appellant to further amend his Amended Notice of Appeal to raise those further alleged errors of law  Leave was opposed by the Respondent on the basis that there had been ample time for the Appellant to seek leave prior to the hearing  that the Appellant had already amended his Notice of Appeal once and that in any event the grounds were so unlikely to succeed as to render leave futile         In considering the question of leave  I have had regard to the submissions by the parties on the further grounds sought to be raised by the Appellant with a view to determining the likelihood of success of any of the further grounds raised       a  Was it open to the Tribunal to discount the percentage of incapacity of alcoholism to take account of personality disorder        Before the Tribunal  the Appellant relied on the evidence of Dr J  Hargraves psychiatrist who had been treating the Appellant since January    Dr Hargraves evidence was relied on in relation to the involvement of his personality disorder with the identified impairment of his alcoholism and the inability to distinguish the two impairments         The Respondent relied on reports of Doctors Reddan and Stevenson as enabling the Tribunal to consider objectively the separation of the two conditions and to seek to deal with the personality disorder separately from the alcoholism by way of discounting the incapacity of the alcoholism by the personality disorder  The Tribunal had regard to Dr Hargraves opinion that the Appellant suffers from alcoholism and personality disorder  para           It is common ground that personality disorder of the Appellant has been found by previous Tribunal decisions not to be a prescribed impairment  The Tribunal concluded that the prescribed physical or mental impairment in the Appellant s case is alcoholism and alcoholic liver disease         The Tribunal found that  the respondent conceded that the impairment by reason of which the applicant was retired were alcoholism and alcoholic liver disease and this aspect is not in issue    para          The Tribunal concluded in paragraph   that       Dr Hargraves has not opined that the cessation of work was entirely due to the effect of alcoholism  Consequently  whilst the applicant seeks to connect the cessation of work with the correlating escalation in the degree of his impairments  the Tribunal finds that this approach is misdirected and without foundation  It is clear from the reports of Dr Stevenson and Dr Reddan that an objective approach is warranted and this Tribunal agrees       In paragraph   the Tribunal said       Dr Reddan acknowledges the artificiality of separating the symptoms produced by alcohol abuse and personality disorder          On the other hand  Dr Hargraves report took into account both the Appellant s personality disorder and his alcoholism in assessing the incapacity of the Appellant to undertake to the Accepted Kinds of Employment         Dr Reddan  in her report at page   states       I think that people with personality disorder seem to be more prone to alcohol abuse       At AB   Dr Reddan was asked in chief       If you were asked to look at Mr House and say  leaving aside the effect of his personality order  what effect does the alcohol abuse have on his capacity to undertake both kinds of employments we have identified  Is it possible can you make an assessment of just the effect of the alcohol abuse      Answer       Well  it is artificial and its difficult  As I said in that report things like attending work intoxicated or other sequelae of alcohol abuse I suppose we should say might have certain sequelae for some jobs but not for others  So the sort of percentages I was sort of estimating then were really when you kind of combine the two together and I think you d really have to kind of almost if you assign a percentage you d almost sort of have to harvest in each case in relation to personality or alcohol but it s a somewhat artificial kind of distinction that in real life isn t quite right          Having regard to the finding of the Tribunal in respect of the separation of the personality disorder from alcoholism and the consequent halving of the impairment  the Tribunal clearly acknowledges the evidence of Dr Reddan that there is an artificiality in separating the symptoms  Whilst I may not necessarily have come to the same conclusion  it is clear that the Tribunal s finding was open to it on the evidence before it         Further  in submissions before the Tribunal  the Respondent clearly invited the Tribunal to discount the incapacity arising from the Appellant s personality disorder although at the same time making it clear to the Tribunal that that was not an exercise that had been done before        The Appellant did not seek to address that submission in any way at the hearing and states today that it was because neither he nor his representative had expected such a submission to be put and did not expect the Tribunal to make a finding in accordance with that submission  The Appellant stated today that the matter did not concern him at the time as he was of the view that it had not been possible on the medical evidence to date  and particularly in relation to Dr Hargraves evidence  to separate the alcoholism from the personality disorder  That is unfortunate and I have a deal of sympathy for the Appellant in perhaps failing to challenge those submissions when he had the opportunity  However  it cannot be said that opportunity was denied him citedMcGovern and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority     ALD  The Tribunal found in summary as follows  The Tribunal s task was to decide the appropriate invalidity classification of Mr House on   November   which was the date Mr House sought a review of his invalidity classification by the Authority  The Tribunal was required to determine  as at   November   the percentage of Mr House s incapacity in relation to civil employment  and the appropriate classification in respect of that incapacity for the purposes of s   and s   of the Act  The Tribunal was required to give consideration to the impairment for which Mr House was retired  The Tribunal found that the primary reason for Mr House s discharge was his alcoholism condition which was interrelated with his personality condition  at    Accordingly  alcoholism was the prescribed physical or mental impairment for the purposes of s   of the Act  The Tribunal was required to consider whether the personality disorder of Mr House should be accepted as being one of his prescribed physical or mental impairments which was a cause of the incapacity by reason of which he was retired  In so considering  the Tribunal found  It had long been recognised that Mr House had a personality disorder  There was considerable medical evidence that this disorder was part of Mr House s  constitution  and that the personality disorder was present at the time of his enlistment  However under the scheme of the Act a constitutional condition may itself constitute a prescribed physical or mental impairment  at    This is recognised by s   of the Act  In order for the personality disorder of Mr House to constitute a prescribed impairment there must be some evidence that this condition rendered Mr House incapable of performing his duties  at    Evidence that the personality disorder of Mr House could  impact  upon his employment was given by one of the psychiatrists  Dr Reddan  There was evidence before the Tribunal that the personality disorder of Mr House was a significant condition  The Tribunal interpreted evidence of Dr Reddan as meaning that Mr House s personality condition was as significant as the alcohol condition as an impairment  and that both conditions could impact on Mr House s employment  at    Accordingly  the Tribunal concluded that the personality disorder of Mr House was one cause of his retirement  and that for the purposes of s  B a  of the Act  alcoholism and the personality disorder of Mr House were his prescribed physical and mental impairments  at      The Tribunal referred to s  A  of the Act which provides that  in determining the percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment of a recipient member  the Authority shall have regard to  inter alia   the kinds of civil employment which a person with skills  qualifications and experience referred to in s  A a  of the Act might reasonably undertake  The Tribunal accepted as relevant the kinds of civil employment submitted by the Authority  but also accepted a number of categories nominated by Mr House  Specifically the Tribunal found that      the kinds of civil employment which Mr House with skills  qualifications and experience referred to in section  A a  of the Act might reasonably undertake would be as a driver  mobile plant operator  labourer  store person  mining and construction labourer  security officer  powder monkey  sub contractor in mining and construction  and foreman in any of those fields   at     The Tribunal was required to have regard to the degree to which any physical or mental impairment of Mr House had diminished his capacity to undertake the kinds of civil employment accepted by the Tribunal  In this case the Tribunal noted that it would ordinarily examine the degree to which each prescribed impairment diminished the capacity of Mr House to undertake each of the relevant kinds of employment  but that in the circumstances it would be artificial to endeavour to determine the effect of each prescribed impairment  at      In this case it would be inappropriate to simply perform a mathematical calculation by taking an average of various percentages of impairment for the kinds of employment listed  The Tribunal also noted that it was administering beneficial legislation  It was appropriate for the Tribunal to make a  value judgment  as described in McGovern and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority     ALD    The Tribunal accepted that Mr House was able to drive  that the alcoholism condition of Mr House was in remission  and that Dr Reddan had given Mr House a   rating on two kinds of civil employment that Mr House could reasonably undertake  The Tribunal found that the percentage of incapacity in relation to the civil employment of Mr House for the purposes of s   was    at    Accordingly  the Tribunal found that Mr House had a classification of Class B for the purposes of s   of the Act  such classification to take effect from   November   and made the orders the subject of this appeal  The Appeal I have already set out the orders sought by the Authority in this case  The questions of law raised on the appeal are whether the Tribunal erred at law in    Failing to consider a serious submission     Failing to take into account a relevant consideration  ie that the applicant s condition had improved since       Failing to take into account a relevant consideration  ie that a person with the applicant s skills  qualifications and experience would reasonably be expected to undertake a wider range of civil employment than security officer and foreman     Misdirecting itself as to the nature of the decision it was required to make  or misapplied s   of the Act  and    Making a statement of reasons that was manifestly inadequate    I am satisfied that these are proper questions of law for consideration by this Court  This ground of appeal adds very little to the Authority s submissions concerning the failure of the Tribunal to take into account relevant considerations  To the extent however that the Tribunal  after referring to McGovern and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority     ALD   at   stated that it was required to have regard to the width  quality and nature of the range of employment opportunities and make a  value judgment  it appeared that the Tribunal actually did not have regard to the  width  quality and nature of the range in employment opportunities   As I have already noted  it appears that the Tribunal in making its decision as to the level of incapacity took into consideration only two of the nine employment types  It follows therefore that the Tribunal did not follow the procedure it outlined for itself as necessary  In this respect the Tribunal appears to have made an error of law  Fifth ground of appeal Mr Harding on behalf of Mr House submitted that the Tribunal made findings in respect of each of the issues under s   of the Act  was required to make a global assessment which is not a mathematical exercise  and was not required to give detailed explanation of the manner in which it arrived at its conclusions  While this may be true as a general proposition  nonetheless in my view some explanation is required where the Tribunal appears to make decisions which appear contrary to the weight of evidence  as is the case in relation to the Tribunal s value judgment that Mr House s level of incapacity for civil employment was    I note again that the only explanation given by the Tribunal was as follows    PERCENTAGE OF INCAPACITY OF CIVIL EMPLOYMENT        I consider that it would be inappropriate for me to simply perform a   mathematical calculation   by taking an average of the various percentages of impairment for the kinds of employment listed above  I am also conscious that I am administering beneficial legislation  I accept the fact that Mr House is able to drive as he regularly drives his partner to appointments  I also accept the evidence of Dr John Morris who has made a realistic assessment of the ability of Mr House to be a driver  I also accept that the alcohol condition of Mr House is now in remission and Mr House is to be commended for his responsible attitude  I have already mentioned that in McGovern Deputy President R D Nicholson has stated that I am required to have regard to the width  quality and nature of the range in employment opportunities and make a   value judgment    I have had regard to the fact that Dr Reddan  who has been called by the Authority has given Mr House a   rating on two kinds of civil employment that Mr House could reasonably undertake  Making a   value judgment   I find that the percentage of incapacity in relation to the civil employment of Mr House for the purposes of section   of the Act is   followedMinister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAn administrative decision can be impugned on the basis of error if the decision maker has failed to take into account a consideration which the subject matter  scope and purpose of a statute indicates was necessary to be considered  Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend   HCA         CLR   at    In relation to the submission of the Authority that the Tribunal failed to take into account the improvement in Mr House s condition  I accept the contention that the Tribunal was required  in assessing the percentage of incapacity of Mr House  to take into consideration whether or not Mr House s incapacity for civil employment had changed since he or she was last classified  That this is a relevant consideration follows from a plain reading of s   of the Act    The Authority may  from time to time   if it is satisfied that the percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment of a recipient member in receipt of invalidity pay is such that the classification of the member should be altered   reclassify him in the appropriate classification set out in section   according to the percentage of his incapacity in relation to civil employment   emphasis added The weight the Tribunal gives to such an issue is for the Tribunal as arbiter of fact  Nonetheless improvement in the condition of Mr House was a relevant consideration  as defined in Peko Wallsend   HCA         CLR    In my view Mr Harding s submission in relation to this issue seeks merely to rationalise the failure by the Tribunal to take into account evidence of Mr House s improvement  and does not answer the claim of the Authority in relation to this aspect of the Tribunal s decision  Further  in relation to the submission of the Authority as to the kinds of civil employment taken into account by the Tribunal  s  A  of the Act provides that  in determining what is the percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment  the Authority shall have regard to  inter alia   the following matters     b  the kinds of civil employment which  such a person as Mr House  having his  skills  qualifications and experience might reasonably undertake       c  the degree to which any physical or mental impairment of the recipient member  being a prescribed physical or mental impairment  has or had diminished the capacity of the recipient member to undertake the kinds of civil employment referred to in paragraph  b  citedMorales v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     FCR  That this principle applies in relation to decisions of the Tribunal appears settled law  Comcare Australia v Grimes   FCA   at     Cheung v AAT   FCA   at     In affirming the principle  the Full Court in Morales v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     FCR   said at     In our view  the essentially administrative nature of the Tribunal s function and the nature of its task in looking to the correct or preferable decision  in circumstances where it is to have regard amongst other things to the dictates of fairness  point to the conclusion that the Tribunal may  in appropriate circumstances  conclude that a previous decision should be applied again as the correct and preferable decision when it is sought to revisit the earlier decision at some later time  Of course  the circumstance that a Court has set aside an entire decision may mean that it is either impermissible  or quite inappropriate  to adopt such a course but that would not necessarily be the case where  as here  a particular determination had not itself been the subject of challenge      In the present case  we think it was open to Purvis J  having considered all the relevant circumstances  to regard the previous decision of Mr McMahon as determinative of the s   issue and to decide that this issue should not be reopened  Of course  his Honour might have concluded that this course was not appropriate in the circumstances  but it was a matter of discretion and his Honour s reasons lead us to conclude that he did not see himself as having such discretion  In this respect there was an error of law  The law is clear that failure to consider a submission of substance which  if accepted  would be capable of affecting the outcome of the case  constitutes an error of law   Applicant WAEE v Minister for

the submission of the Authority in relation to previous consideration of the issue of Mr House s personality disorder a submission of substance  In my view it was  While the Tribunal was not necessarily bound by its early decision indeed the decision of the Full Court in Morales     FCR   indicates that the issue was one of discretion nevertheless the submission should have been

grounds of appeal of the Authority are as follows  The Tribunal erred in law in not considering a serious submission of the applicant that  adopting the principle that having regard to the dictates of fairness and expedition  previous Tribunal decisions should generally be regarded as establishing the matters actually decided and the grounds for determination unless there is reason not to do so  Re Quinn   Australian Postal Corporation     AAR   at   the question for the Tribunal is what has changed since the operative date for the previous Tribunal determination of the respondent s incapacity  The Tribunal erred in law in failing to take into account a relevant consideration  ie that the respondent s condition had improved since    The Tribunal was required to take into account this consideration by s   of the Act  The Tribunal erred in law in failing to take into account a relevant consideration  ie that a person with the applicant s skills  qualifications and experience would reasonably be expected to undertake a wider range of civil employment than security officer and foreman  Under s  c  of the Act the Tribunal made its assessment of the degree to which the prescribed impairment of the respondent had diminished his capacity to undertake the kinds of employment identified for the purposes of s  b  of the Act by reference to only two of the nine identified employment kinds  The Tribunal erred in law by misdirecting itself as to the nature of the decision it was required to make  or misapplied s   of the Act  The Tribunal said that it was  required to have regard to the width  quality and nature of the range in employment opportunities and make a  value judgment   But it then made its decision on the assessment of only two of nine identified employment types  The Tribunal s statement of reasons was manifestly inadequate in that it  is impossible to glean from the statement the reasons what was the Tribunal s reasoning process that led to its decisions  and does not state reasons adequate to enable the court to determine whether or not any other error had occurred in the reasoning process  Relevant legislative scheme The governing law in these proceedings is Pt V of the Act  Part V provides invalidity benefits for members of the scheme established by the Act who have been retired on the ground of invalidity or physical or mental incapacity to perform their duties  The initial classification of a member is made under s   which provides as follows        Where a member of the scheme  not being a member of the scheme to whom section   applies  is  or is about to become  entitled to invalidity benefit  the Authority shall determine his percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment and shall classify him according to the percentage of incapacity as follows      Percentage of incapacity   Class       or more   A       or more but less than     B     Less than     C In its Reasons for Decision the Tribunal also referred to s   of the Act  which so far as is relevant in these proceedings provides        The Authority may  from time to time  if it is satisfied that the percentage of incapacity in relation to civil employment of a recipient member in receipt of invalidity pay is such that the classification of the member should be altered  reclassify him in the appropriate classification set out in section

kinds of civil employment which a person with skills  qualifications and experience referred to in paragraph  a  might reasonably undertake     c  the degree to which any physical or mental impairment

invalidity or physical or mental incapacity by reason of which the member was retired  whether or not that impairment changed  for better or worse  since that retirement  or   b  any other physical or mental impairment of the member causally connected with a physical or mental impairment referred to in paragraph  a      Submissions of the parties In re Quinn   Australian Postal Corporation     AAR   at   the Tribunal stated    It would seem inappropriate and unreasonable to us for there to be relitigation without reason of the same issues before the Tribunal  It would be unjust to applicants to have to face a situation where a decision may be made today and relitigated tomorrow on the very same facts  The Tribunal should not generally allow relitigation of issues already decided and previous Tribunal decisions should be regarded as establishing the matters actually decided and of the grounds for the determination citedTobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v National Health and Medical
