html  On   February   the appellant filed written submissions which can be summarised as follows         The Tribunal erred in law amounting to jurisdictional error in determining whether the harm suffered by the appellant amounted to persecution      The Tribunal failed to address the claims that  having a progressive political opinion and also being a member of the BAP  he would be persecuted if he returned to Bangladesh      The Tribunal erred in law amounting to jurisdictional error in determining whether there were adequate protections from the law enforcement agencies in Bangladesh      The Tribunal did not follow the proper procedure as required by the Migration Act    Cth  and the situation in Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal   HCA   was  perfectly identical  to this case  In particular  the appellant submitted that the Tribunal s letter to the appellant contained a statement which was identical to the one quoted by the judge in Muin   HCA     and which the High Court said had misled the applicant in Muin   HCA         The Tribunal did not believe the appellant s claims concerning potential danger to him in Bangladesh  failed to investigate his claims through independent sources  and heavily depended in their reasoning on generalised facts and findings of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs      The Tribunal  failed to internalise the circumstantial grounds of  the  review application while considering the claims of  the  review application       The fact that the Tribunal ignored relevant evidence  and its findings in the face of contradicting independent evidence  indicate actual bias      The Tribunal made no findings as to what socio political changes might occur in Bangladesh in the reasonably foreseeable future  and failed to assess whether the appellant s fears of being persecuted for being a political activist of Bangladesh were well founded in the reasonably foreseeable future      The Tribunal did not provide the appellant with particulars of information  which formed part of the reasons of the Tribunal s decision  namely that the persecution against the political activist of Bangladesh had subsided      The Tribunal made its decision in bad faith   I note that the appellant also claimed  The RRT has failed to investigate my claims  specifically the grounds of persecution  being a woman in Bangladesh   As the appellant is clearly not a woman  this submission is somewhat mystifying   At the hearing before me the appellant made no oral submissions referable to the appeal  However he made a general plea that the Court look with sympathy at his case  and remit the case to the Tribunal for reconsideration   In his grounds of appeal and written submissions the appellant has made wide ranging claims

citedSZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In his grounds of appeal and written submissions the appellant has made wide ranging claims which  in the frequent absence of either substantive argument or particularisation  are difficult to consider  I note also that  in many instances  the grounds raised by the appellant either are not referable to the decision of the learned Federal Magistrate  or raise issues which were not before his Honour and therefore require the leave of this Court  NAJT v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR    However to the extent possible I have considered the appellant s claims  and make the following observations         To the extent that the appellant claims Raphael FM erred in considering that either the delegate of the Minister or the Tribunal made an unbiased decision  it is not clear from the grounds of appeal which  decision  the appellant referred to  however I assume the relevant decision was that of the Tribunal as it is that decision Raphael FM was reviewing  I note that this claim is based in a claim by the appellant that the Tribunal ignored relevant evidence and made its findings in the face of contradicting independent evidence  However  as his Honour stated  it was clear that the Tribunal had considered the evidence which was before it  A finding against the appellant on the facts  or ascribing weight to the evidence which is not in the appellant s favour  is not only not bias from the
