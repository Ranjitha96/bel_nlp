Silvan Australia Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlA similar case concerning backpack style containers used for spot spraying pests and weeds was heard before Finkelstein J in Outdoor Power Products Pty Ltd v Silvan Australia Pty Ltd   FCA    In that case  Finkelstein J considered an application for an interlocutory injunction to restrain an infringement of a trade mark over the  Solo Sprayer   His injunction considered the elements of the claimed passing off action and found it to be made out sufficiently for the purposes of an interlocutory application  His Honour held that in a case where it was clear that the offending product was interfering with the applicant s goodwill  damages would not be an adequate remedy  As I indicated earlier  I have been provided in Court this morning with the football kicking tee as sold by the first respondent which I have referred to as the infringing kicking tee  and a  Sharp Shooter  football kicking tee  I am in no doubt that the general appearance of each is extremely similar  I agree with Finkelstein J that in circumstances where it is clear that an infringement of the Registered Design by the respondents is being used to interfere with the goodwill of the applicants and being used to erode the applicants  market share in breach of the applicants  monopoly rights pursuant to the Registered Design  damages would not be an adequate remedy       Balance of convenience As I have already indicated  there is evidence that  o the respondents are selling infringing kicking tees which may infringe the applicants  registered design o there is a history of communication between these parties  including it appears undertakings by the respondents not to continue to sell kicking tees which infringe the applicants  Registered Design o the infringing kicking tees which the respondents are selling bear a very strong similarity to the applicants  kicking tees  Again  it is unfortunate that the respondents did not appear today  However  the factors I have listed above  in particular the history of this matter as presented to me by the applicants  persuade me that it would be appropriate to grant the applicants interlocutory relief as they seek  Further  as evidenced by the email and letter exhibited to the affidavit of Mr Philp  the respondents had already indicated that they would not be selling kicking tees which infringe the applicants  Registered Design  An order restraining them from selling the infringing kicking tees appears to be compatible with undertakings it seems they made in   appliedPharmacia Italia SPA v Pfizer  Perth  Pty Ltd v Interpharma Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlThe Federal Court is empowered to make

the Court has not had the benefit of submissions from the respondents on these points  However  the visual similarity in the tees is clear  Gummow J in Wanem Pty Ltd v John Tekiela     IPR   at   said  the design applies to the appearance of the article as a whole and issues of infringement are to be approached with that in mind   Prima facie   there is a case that the tees sold by the first respondent infringe the Registered Design of the applicants under the Designs Act    Cth   Further  there is affidavit evidence from the applicants that at least some infringing kicking tees are being sold in stores operated by the first respondents  Finally  there is evidence before the Court  including correspondence from the respondents  which supports the third contention of the applicants in relation to the conduct of the respondents  In my view  these issues indicate that there is a serious question to be tried       Damages insufficient In their written submissions and in oral submissions this morning the applicants submitted that whilst an account of profits or damages in respect of the infringements to date are sought in the eventual trial  long term damage to the market for kicking tees to which their Registered Design has been legitimately applied is of most concern
