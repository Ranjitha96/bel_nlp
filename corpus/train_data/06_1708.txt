Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedACCC v Maritime Union of Australia   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Section   Trade Practices Act specifically applies to conduct in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a consumer or the payment for goods or services by a consumer  and therefore is founded in an existing  or possible  contractual relationship between the corporation and the consumer  In the event that the consumer becomes bankrupt  it follows that any legal action arising from the contractual relationship between the consumer and the corporation vests in the trustee in bankruptcy  Although there is little case law interpreting this section    The word  undue  which qualifies  harassment  suggests that what is done must  having regard to the circumstances  extend beyond that which is acceptable or reasonable   ACCC v Maritime Union of Australia   FCA         FCR   per Hill J at        Harassment  in this context means persistent disturbance or torment   ACCC v Maritime Union of Australia at     Undue harassment  therefore means that conduct which amounts to harassment will only amount to a contravention of the section where what is done goes beyond the normal limits which  in the circumstances  society would regard as acceptable or reasonable and not excessive or disproportionate   ACCC v Maritime Union of Australia at    Accordingly  it follows that the section contemplates that some harassment of a consumer by a corporation in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services or in respect of payment for goods or services by a consumer can be tolerated and is not unlawful      Coercion  carries with it the connotation of force or compulsion or threats of force or compulsion negating choice or freedom to act   Hodges v Webb     Ch   at     per Peterson J  ACCC v Maritime Union of Australia at

Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  This is not a case where parts of the pleadings could simply be struck out and the action remain on foot  As Lander J observed in A ustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Fox Symes   Associates Pty Ltd   FCA        If a Statement of Claim is shown to disclose no reasonable cause of action  then it will be appropriate  rather than to strike out individual paragraphs of the Statement of Claim  to strike out the whole of the Statement of Claim    at   Although ordinarily a party should be given an opportunity to replead in accordance with the rules   Turner v The Bulletin Newspaper Co Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   per Barwick CJ  Mason J agreeing  at   cf Fox Symes at   in my view it would be unjust to the respondents to allow the applicant yet another opportunity to re plead  In particular I note    Greenwood J had earlier dismissed an application by the applicant for interlocutory relief in this matter on the basis that  inter alia   the applicant lacked standing to bring the application  but noted that it was possible that the applicant could formulate a statement of claim involving rights which had not vested in the trustee in bankruptcy   Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd   Ors   FCA   at       on   June   the applicant filed a Statement of Claim    on   June   the applicant filed an Amended Statement of Claim  although this amended statement of claim was not provided to the respondents until   June   when the parties appeared in Court    when this matter came before me for the notice of motion to be heard on   June   it became apparent that the applicant would in fact need to file a further amended statement of claim  I ordered that the applicant be given   days in which to file a further amended statement of claim    the applicant did so in compliance with this order  but then also filed a second further amended statement of claim   days later   As Mason CJ and Brennan and Toohey JJ observed in Munnings v Australian Government Solicitor   HCA         ALR   at          Although a plaintiff is often granted leave to replead if a statement of claim is struck out  there

clear from the statement of claim that the applicant bitterly resents conduct in which he alleges the respondents engaged which he believes caused his bankruptcy  and indeed bitterly resents the fact of his bankruptcy  However the applicant has become a bankrupt through lawful process in the Federal Court and has throughout that process had opportunities to challenge the circumstances leading to his bankruptcy  I respectfully adopt comments of McInerney J in Campbell v Metway Leasing Ltd   ATPR      In that case the appellants pleaded undue harassment or coercion by the respondents in relation to  inter alia   issuing two bankruptcy notices where there were allegedly no debts due  His Honour said at        In my opinion  however  the institution of legal proceedings which are not themselves vexatious  frivolous or an abuse of process  and therefore liable to be summarily dismissed under Part   rule   of the Supreme Court Rules    NSW  cannot constitute  undue  harassment or coercion for the purposes of section    Fair Trading Act    NSW  being the NSW equivalent of section   Trade Practices Act   as a plaintiff  within these bounds  has a legitimate right of recourse to the Courts for the determination of their claim or grievance   To the extent that the third respondent allegedly threatened the applicant with  a life long vendetta   par   and in relation to the applicant s allegations concerning the alleged theft of files by the third and fourth respondents  par   the applicant has not pleaded   a  how the third and fourth respondents  who are individuals

are liable in relation to this claim    c  if s   is relied on  how the conduct in question is relevant to the provision of goods and services or payment for goods and services as required by the legislation   Further  in relation to the alleged theft of the applicant s files claimed in par   I repeat my comments earlier in relation to Count   concerning   a  whether this conduct constitutes undue harassment in breach of s   and   b  the fact that unlawful access of the respondents to the applicant s home and his possessions potentially gives rise to cause of action in the State courts in

every field of legislative control into which a corporation might stray for the purposes of  or in connection with  carrying on its trading or commercial activities  What the section is concerned with

interactions between corporations and other parties in the commercial context  involving commercial transactions  To the extent that these legislative provisions are relevant in this context  and there are possible issues with respect to their relevance in respect of conduct in relation to financial services  which I need not discuss for the purposes of this judgment  it is difficult to

respect of the applicant s estate was made on   February    His Honour explained    the effect of s   Bankruptcy Act   which vests the property of the bankrupt in the registered trustee  at     the meaning of  property of the bankrupt  for the purposes of s     which is defined as  the property divisible among the bankrupt s creditors  and any rights and powers in relation to that property that would have been exercisable by the bankrupt if he or she had not become a bankrupt   at     the fact that property divisible amongst the creditors for the purposes in s   includes  the capacity to exercise  and to take proceedings for exercising all such powers in  over or in respect of property as might have been exercised by the bankrupt for his own benefit at the commencement of the bankruptcy or at any time after the commencement of the bankruptcy and before his discharge   at     that only the trustee in bankruptcy is entitled to seek remedial orders in respect of property  contractual rights  security interests  and related entitlements  at     that the exemption in s  g  with respect to wrongs done to the bankrupt is limited to those cases where the essential cause of action is the personal injury done to the person or feelings of the bankrupt  as distinct from where the damages or part of them are to be estimated by reference to the bankrupt s rights of property  at     cf Daemar v Industrial Commission of New South Wales     ALR   at   Cox v Journeaux  No     HCA         CLR   at   Faulkner v Bluett     FLR   at     that a claim with respect to a wrong done to the applicant characterised by reference to the anxiety  stress and pain felt by the bankrupt in respect of a recognised cause of action remains with the applicant under s  g  Bankruptcy Act  at   and    that in the case before his Honour the claims were not claims for damages founded upon immediate reference to the distress and anxiety caused to the bankrupt without reference to his rights of property  at   further the applicant s claim for final relief was a consequential claim necessarily connected with the applicant s interests in property  at     In my view  to the extent that this is

applies to conduct in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a consumer or the payment for goods or services by a consumer  and therefore is founded in an existing  or possible  contractual relationship between the corporation and the consumer  In the event that the consumer becomes bankrupt  it follows that any legal action arising from the contractual relationship between the consumer and the corporation vests in the trustee in bankruptcy  Although there is little case law interpreting this section    The word  undue  which qualifies  harassment  suggests that what is done must  having regard to the circumstances  extend beyond that which is acceptable or reasonable   ACCC v Maritime Union of Australia   FCA         FCR   per Hill J at        Harassment  in this context means persistent disturbance or torment   ACCC v Maritime Union of Australia at     Undue harassment  therefore means that conduct which amounts to harassment will only amount to a contravention of the section where what is done goes beyond the normal limits which  in the circumstances  society would regard as acceptable or reasonable and not excessive or disproportionate   ACCC v Maritime Union of Australia at    Accordingly  it follows that the section contemplates that some harassment of a consumer by a corporation in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services or in respect of payment for goods or services by a consumer can be tolerated and is not unlawful      Coercion  carries with it the connotation of force or compulsion or threats of force

Finkelstein JJ at   In my view  the case before me exhibits none of these attributes  To the extent that the statement of claim pleads causes of action at all    the applicant lacks standing in almost all Counts on account of his bankruptcy    even if the applicant did have standing under s  g  Bankruptcy Act because he had rights to recover damages or compensation in respect of personal injuries

Brennan and Toohey JJ observed in Munnings v Australian Government Solicitor   HCA         ALR   at          Although a plaintiff is often granted leave to replead if a statement of claim is struck out  there are some cases where the plaintiff so misconceives the cause of action that the action ought to be brought to an end    cf Fox Symes at   citedParkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In my view the applicant lacks standing in respect of this claim  Any claims in respect of the matters pleaded are vested in the trustee in bankruptcy  My reasons are as follows   a  Sections  AA and   Trade Practices Act apply to conduct of corporations  The only conduct referred to in this Count is that of the third respondent  Mr Hare who is obviously an individual    b  The statement of claim does not  in respect of ss  AA or     draw a nexus between the alleged conduct of Mr Hare and the corporate respondents  Unlike in relation to the claim that the applicant was harassed by Mr Hare acting as agent for all respondents in breach of s     no responsibility for alleged unconscionable conduct or misleading or deceptive behaviour by Mr Hare is attributed to the corporate respondents  Accordingly  there is no evidence that the corporate respondents acted unconscionably towards the applicant within the meaning of s  AA in terms of this Count  Similarly  to the extent that the applicant was misled by Mr Hare  this appears to be conduct for which the other respondents were not responsible  note Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   per Gibbs CJ at   and Mason J at      c  Although the applicant claims that the third respondent  as agent for all of the respondents  coerced him contrary to s     the conduct in breach of s   is neither pleaded nor particularised  It is not possible to ascertain from the pleading how the respondents allegedly acted in breach of s   other than claims by the applicant that he was misled  This does not in my view in any way entail harassment or coercion    d  Similarly to Count   the claim of the applicant again is in substance in relation to financial injury  In a somewhat telling statement  the applicant in par   claims  relief from the payment of principal and interest and costs claimed by the respondents due to the deception and unconscionable conduct of the respondents   Again  this is illustrative of the fact that the applicant seems to fail to appreciate that he is now a bankrupt  and any payments of this

Co Pty Ltd   Ors   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The factual background to this matter is set out at some length in the judgment of Greenwood J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd   Ors   FCA   at      The applicant and the respondents before his Honour were the same parties as are currently before me  Before his Honour  the applicant sought various orders  including interlocutory relief restraining the respondents from exercising a power of sale  and in respect of a number of loan agreements  deeds of settlement  mortgages and other instruments relating to various properties   At that hearing the respondents submitted  and Greenwood J found  that the majority of Mr Rogers  claims for final relief involved claims related to the legal or beneficial interest of the applicant in property which vested in the trustee in bankruptcy  and accordingly in respect of which the applicant had no standing to institute legal proceedings   FCA   at    However his Honour noted that s   Bankruptcy Act    Cth    Bankruptcy Act   excised categories of property from the interests  rights  capacities and powers divisible among the bankruptcy s creditors  including            g  any right of the bankrupt to recover damages or compensation         i  for personal injury or wrong done to the bankrupt  the spouse of the bankrupt or a member of the family of the bankrupt          And any damages or compensation recovered by the bankrupt  whether before or after he or she became a bankrupt  in respect of such an injury or wrong   Mr Rogers claimed that the matters he sought to agitate before his Honour by way of final relief and interlocutory relief fell within the exemption contemplated by s  g  Bankruptcy Act because  properly understood  the claims constituted a claim with respect to a  wrong done to the bankrupt  and the right to recover damages or compensation for each wrong remained with the applicant  As his Honour summarised     In effect  Mr Rogers says a claim based upon conduct on the part of the respondents that bears the statutory character of misleading or deceptive conduct or unconscionable conduct on the part of ALC or ALCPL  or the respondents more generally  in connection with the supply of financial services reflected in the various deeds  is a claim for compensation for a wrong which Mr Rogers is entitled to assert     FCA   at   Before Greenwood J the respondents said that  to the extent that such a claim  however it might be formulated  is one with respect to a legal or beneficial interest of the bankrupt in land or involves any right  power or capacity in relation to such an interest  the claim vests in the trustee in bankruptcy   After considering each of the applicant s claims for relief and the meaning of the phrase  wrong done to the bankrupt  in the context of s  g    Greenwood J held that     Where the claim for final relief arising out of the conduct of a respondent reflects a claim with respect to both the rights of the bankrupt in property and a claim with respect to a wrong done to the bankrupt characterised as a claim by reference to the anxiety  stress and pain felt by the bankruptcy  the rights of action in respect of the bankrupt s interests in property vest in the trustee and those rights of action where the essential cause is emotional injury done to the bankrupt  in respect of a recognised cause of action  remain with the bankrupt    at   His Honour continued     It may be that when Mr Rogers or his advisers formulate a statement of claim in the proceeding  a claim might emerge which  in terms of its material facts  reflects a claim within the exemption reliant upon conduct which involves a contravention of ss      AC or   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  independently of any of the former rights of the bankrupt in property which have become vested in the trustee  At the moment the material does not establish any such right  The alleged contraventions of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  which are mere conclusionary assertions are relied upon as the basis for final orders with respect to the interests of the bankrupt in property which interests have become vested in the trustee    at   Similarly a claim by the applicant for interlocutory relief in the form of  an order that the respondents do not harass  intimidate or coerce the applicant  his family or neighbours  was not a claim called in aid of a claim for final relief within the scope of s  g  Bankruptcy Act   but rather was in connection with an injunction to restrain an exercise of power of sale in relation to a particular property by a secured creditor in aid of final relief in relation to that property  The applicant s interest in the property was an interest vested in his trustee  However his Honour left open the possibility that the applicant could properly formulate a claim for final relief within the exemption in s  g    and a claim for interlocutory relief in respect of relevant conduct  which claim might well be made by the applicant independently of his trustee in bankruptcy  at   and     In the notice of motion before me  the respondents seek orders in respect of what is  in essence  the applicant s attempt to take on board the comments of Greenwood J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd   namely an attempt by the applicant to formulate his statement of claim so as to plead claims coming within the exemption in s  g  Bankruptcy Act    After the decision of Greenwood J was handed down  the applicant filed a statement of claim on   June   and an amended statement of claim on   June     When I heard this notice of motion on   June   it became apparent that the applicant required leave to further amend his statement of claim filed   June    Mr Coulsen on behalf of the respondents consented to an adjournment of the matter to allow the applicant to be given an opportunity to re plead  In making this suggestion Mr Coulsen said that this would be the last time his clients would so consent  Consequently  the matter was adjourned until   August   and the applicant was ordered to file and serve an amended statement of claim by   July     When this matter came back before me on   August   it became apparent that the applicant had in fact filed two further amended statements of claim during the adjournment period  one on   July   and one on   July    Nonetheless  and notwithstanding the inconvenience to the respondents as it appeared that the further amended statement of claim of   July   had not been served on the respondents  in order for the matter to be heard the respondents did not object to the hearing proceeding on the basis of the statement of claim filed   July    I adjourned the hearing for a short time to allow Mr Coulsen the opportunity to compare the two documents and if necessary amend his submissions   As Greenwood J noted in his judgment   FCA   at   with respect to the claims of the applicant against the respondents  the most immediate difficulty confronting the applicant is the question of whether he has standing in connection with this litigation  on the basis that a sequestration order in respect of the applicant s estate was made on   February    His Honour explained    the effect of s   Bankruptcy Act   which vests the property of the bankrupt in the registered trustee  at     the meaning of  property of the bankrupt  for the purposes of s     which is defined as  the property divisible among the bankrupt s creditors  and any rights and powers in relation to that property that would have been exercisable by the bankrupt if he or she had not become a bankrupt   at     the fact that property divisible amongst the creditors for the purposes in s   includes  the capacity to exercise  and to take proceedings for exercising all such powers in  over or in respect of property as might have been exercised by the bankrupt for his own benefit at the commencement of the bankruptcy or at any time after the commencement of the bankruptcy and before his discharge   at     that only the trustee in bankruptcy is entitled to seek remedial orders in respect of property  contractual rights  security interests  and related entitlements  at     that the exemption in s  g  with respect to wrongs done to the bankrupt is limited to those cases where the essential cause of action is the personal injury done to the person or feelings of the bankrupt  as distinct from where the damages or part of them are to be estimated by reference to the bankrupt s rights of property  at     cf Daemar v Industrial Commission of New South Wales     ALR   at   Cox v Journeaux  No     HCA         CLR   at   Faulkner v Bluett     FLR   at     that a claim with respect to a wrong done to the applicant characterised by reference to the anxiety  stress and pain felt by the bankrupt in respect of a recognised cause of action remains with the applicant under s  g  Bankruptcy Act  at   and    that in the case before his Honour the claims were not claims for damages founded upon immediate reference to the distress and anxiety caused to the bankrupt without reference to his rights of property  at   further the applicant s claim for final relief was a consequential claim necessarily connected with the applicant s interests in property  at     It is unnecessary for me to add to the comments of Greenwood J with respect to the consequences of the bankruptcy of the applicant and its impact on his standing in the case before me  Clearly  for the applicant as distinct from his trustee in bankruptcy to have standing to maintain a cause of action it is necessary that he not only plead that a personal injury or wrong has been done to him  but that the essential cause of action is that personal injury or wrong has been done to him   Throughout his statement of claim the applicant relies on breaches of ss  AA     and   Trade Practices Act as founding his causes of action  These sections read as follows       AA  Unconscionable conduct within the meaning of the unwritten law of the States and Territories         A corporation must not  in trade or commerce  engage in conduct that is unconscionable within the meaning of the unwritten law  from time to time  of the States and Territories      This section does not apply to conduct that is prohibited by section  AB or  AC             Misleading or deceptive conduct         A corporation shall not  in trade or commerce  engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive      Nothing in the succeeding provisions of this Division shall be taken as limiting by implication the generality of subsection            Harassment and coercion   A corporation shall not use physical force or undue harassment or coercion in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a consumer or the payment for goods or services by a consumer   It is useful to make a number of preliminary points concerning these provisions before examining the substance of the applicant s complaint   This is surprising in light of the finding of Greenwood J that  in view of his bankruptcy  the applicant lacked standing to pursue claims other than those which were clearly in respect of a personal injury or wrong done to the bankrupt or his family  Unfortunately  in my view the preponderance of the statement of claim appears to revisit a great deal of the material which was before Greenwood J  which his Honour held did not give rise to causes of action in respect of which the applicant had standing   Although ordinarily a party should be given an opportunity to replead in accordance with the rules   Turner v The Bulletin Newspaper Co Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   per Barwick CJ  Mason J agreeing  at   cf Fox Symes at   in my view it would be unjust to the respondents to allow the applicant yet another opportunity to re plead  In particular I note    Greenwood J had earlier dismissed an application by the applicant for interlocutory relief in this matter on the basis that  inter alia   the applicant lacked standing to bring the application  but noted that it was possible that the applicant could formulate a statement of claim involving rights which had not vested in the trustee in bankruptcy   Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd   Ors   FCA   at       on   June   the applicant filed a Statement of Claim    on   June   the applicant filed an Amended Statement of Claim  although this amended statement of claim was not provided to the respondents until   June   when the parties appeared in Court    when this matter came before me for the notice of motion to be heard on   June   it became apparent that the applicant would in fact need to file a further amended statement of claim  I ordered that the applicant be given   days in which to file a further amended statement of claim    the applicant did so in compliance with this order  but then also filed a second further amended statement of claim   days later consideredRose v Buckett     KB   To the extent that this conduct in allegedly burgling applicant s home and stealing documents constitutes undue harassment in breach of s     a connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a consumer or the payment for goods or services by a consumer must be established  The applicant does not plead how the conduct of the respondents in stealing documents constitutes undue harassment in relation to the supply of goods or services  or payment for goods or services  However rights of action in relation to unlawful access of the respondents to the applicant s home and his possessions are in the realm of tort and potentially relate to a personal injury or wrong to the applicant  In Rose v Buckett     KB   the defendants had entered the bankrupt s house on several occasions and seized goods  furniture and effects  The bankrupt alleged damage to premises  damage to goods and  personal inconvenience and annoyance to himself and family  by being wrongfully deprived of his property and of the quiet enjoyment of his house and premises from time to time by the defendants   Collins LJ said     Where the damages to property by trespass and conversion are merely nominal  the cause of action in respect thereof is not regarded as one affecting the value of the property passing to the trustee  so as to give him a right of action in respect thereof  but rather as a wrong personal to the bankrupt himself  which could not found an action by his trustee  This view is well put by Cresswell J in his opinion delivered to the House of Lords in Beckham v Drake  He says   In  a number of cases  it was decided that rights of action for trespass to land or goods in the actual possession of a trader do not pass to his assignees if he becomes bankrupt  because those rights of action are given in respect of the immediate and present violation of the possession of the bankrupt  independently of his rights of property  and are an extension of the protection given to his person  and the primary personal injury to the bankrupt is the principal and essential cause of action     at     cf Stirling LJ at   For present purposes however  I also note that the applicant has not particularised the nature of any personal injury he has suffered as a result of the respondents stealing his files and records  or indeed any other wrongs he alleges  He has also not drawn a nexus between the conduct of the respondents and any personal injury or wrong  or between the provisions of the Trade Practices Act and the wrongs he alleges  Although it is possible that the applicant experienced personal injury by being wrongfully deprived of his property and of the quiet enjoyment of his house and premises as was the case in Rose v Buckett   the manner in which the statement of claim is framed in respect of these facts could equally vest the trustee in bankruptcy with the claim  on the basis that any records of the applicant relevant to his financial position vested in the trustee and deprivation of those records gives rise to an action in the trustee  Accordingly  I refer to my comments in respect of Count   in this regard   Accordingly  the applicant lacks standing in respect of this claim   Similarly to Count   although the applicant claims that he suffered  personal injury  in respect of this conduct of the respondents  the substance of this complaint is that he suffered financial injury in respect of transactions involving the Palmwood Drive Property  Claims with respect to financial damage have clearly vested in the applicant s trustee in bankruptcy  To the extent that a claim exists under ss  AA and   Trade Practices Act in respect of these facts  it has clearly vested in the applicant s trustee in bankruptcy citedTrade Practices Commission v Australian Iron and Steel Pty Limited     FCR   The case before me is indeed a case where the observations of Lockhart J in Trade Practices Commission v Australian Iron and Steel Pty Limited     FCR   resonate     The Statement of Claim  fails to plead material facts  it contains confusing and irrelevant material  it uses ambiguous terms  pleads particulars rather than material facts and asserts conclusions or opinions    at   To the extent that there is anything in the applicant s statement of claim which pleads a valid cause of action  in respect of which he has standing  then as Lockhart J also observed in Australian Iron and Steel         the defective parts are so inextricably intertwined with offending material that an oppressive burden is cast upon the respondents to spell out the alleged cause or causes of action  The whole pleading must be struck out  citedTurner v The Bulletin Newspaper Co Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Although ordinarily a party should be given an opportunity to replead in accordance with the rules   Turner v The Bulletin Newspaper Co Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   per Barwick CJ  Mason J agreeing  at   cf Fox Symes at   in my view it would be unjust to the respondents to allow the applicant yet another opportunity to re plead  In particular I note    Greenwood J had earlier dismissed an application by the applicant for interlocutory relief in this matter on the basis that  inter alia   the applicant lacked standing to bring the application  but noted that it was possible that the applicant could formulate a statement of claim involving rights which had not vested in the trustee in bankruptcy   Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd   Ors   FCA   at       on   June   the applicant filed a Statement of Claim    on   June   the applicant filed an Amended Statement of Claim  although this amended statement of claim was not provided to the respondents until   June   when the parties appeared in Court    when this matter came before me for the notice of motion to be heard on   June   it became apparent that the applicant would in fact need to file a further amended statement of claim  I ordered that the applicant be given   days in which to file a further amended statement of claim    the applicant did so in compliance with this order  but then also filed a second further amended statement of claim   days later citedVision Telecommunications Pty Ltd   Ors v

to a Deed  pars      Refusal to advance funds in circumstances where a party is obliged to do so clearly falls into the realms of breach of contract  Rivkin   Co Ltd v Young     ACSR   Vision Telecommunications Pty Ltd   Ors v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd   WASC   at     There is no evidence before this Court supporting an allegation of breach of contract by the respondents

cth federal ct  html  In my view no cause of action is disclosed by this Count  Nothing in the pleadings particularises any complaint with respect to the respondents or any of them refusing to lift the caveat as complained in par    If there was an issue with respect to the caveat and the respondents acting unlawfully  the New South Wales State Courts would have been the appropriate venue to raise it  cf comments of Dowsett J in Von Risefer v Permanent Trustee Company Pty Ltd   FCA   at       Further  the applicant does not in his pleadings demonstrate the unequal bargaining positions which make s  AA relevant  Section   appears irrelevant in this context  To the extent that the pleadings raise issues of coercion under s     in my view the cause of action has vested in the trustee in bankruptcy as the facts as pleaded clearly relate to property of the bankrupt   Personal injury is not particularised  and I refer again to my comments concerning Count   citedWearne v Southern

federal ct  html  In my view  to the extent that this is a cause of action under ss  AA and    and in my view the relevance of s  AA is dubious  it is not one in respect of which the applicant has suffered personal injury within the meaning of s  g  Bankruptcy Act   This is because  notwithstanding the claim that the applicant has suffered personal injury   a  Other than a statement that the applicant suffered personal injury  no injury is particularised or connection drawn between how a failure to warn and advise the applicant caused the applicant to suffer personal injury  A bare allegation that the applicant has suffered personal injury or wrong  without particularising the injury or wrong  or without stating the connection between the conduct complained of and the claimed personal injury or wrong  is not adequate to provide the applicant with standing to pursue litigation in the very limited circumstances of his bankruptcy  Particularising the damage and establishing the nexus would be necessary in any event  As explained in well known comments of Bowen LJ in Ratcliffe v Evans     QB   at        The necessity of alleging and proving actual temporal loss with certainty and precision in all cases of the sort has been insisted upon for centuries    In all actions accordingly on the case where the damage actually done is the gist of the action  the character of the acts themselves which produce the damage  and the circumstances under which these acts are done  must regulate the degree of certainty and particularity with which the damage done ought to be stated and proved  As much certainty and particularity must be insisted on  both in pleading and proof of damage  as is reasonable  having regard to the circumstances and to the nature of the acts themselves by which the damage is done  To insist upon less would be to relax old and intelligible principles  To insist upon more would be the vainest pedantry      note similar comments by Dillon LJ

note O   r   Federal Court Rules   and the pleadings must be sufficiently clear  so that the case against the respondents is clear    c  If the claim is to be categorised as a claim in negligence which has resulted in financial loss  it properly lies with the trustee in bankruptcy  Faulkner v Bluett     d  If the claim is to be categorised as a breach of fiduciary duty or trust it properly lies with the trustee in bankruptcy  As pointed out by RD Nicholson J in Pridmore v Magenta Nominees Pty Ltd     ALR   at        In relation to s  a   the property of the bankrupt  as defined in par  a  would include any choses in action which the applicants had to enforce equitable rights  Such rights  being property being divisible among the creditors of the bankrupt  would vest in the official trustee  If the equitable rights arose after the sequestration order it would for the same reasons be  property that is divisible amongst the creditors of the bankrupt  within s   and thus property to which s  b  applies so that again the exercise of the rights would vest in the official trustee        note also Wily  as Trustee of the Bankrupt Estate of Fuller  v Fuller   FCA     Pascoe  in the matter of Hudson   FCA      e  If the claim is categorised as a breach of ss  AA or     it is claim with respect to a commercial transaction which has now vested in the trustee in bankruptcy
