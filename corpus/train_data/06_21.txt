TPC v CSR   at    commonly known as the  French factors      the size of the contravening company    the degree of power it has  as evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market        the deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended        whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level        whether the company has a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Act   as evidenced by educational programs and disciplinary or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention  and       whether the company has shown a disposition to co operate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention   In NW Frozen Foods the majority of the Court observed at      In TNT  at   it was pointed out that some other factors which have been regarded as important actually flow from what French J called in CSR Ltd  at    t he primacy of the deterrent purpose in the imposition of penalty   One of those factors is the size of the corporation involved  since  w hat would deter a small company might have little effect on a very large one           As Smithers J emphasised in Stihl Chain Saws  at   insistence upon the deterrent quality of a penalty should be balanced by insistence that it  not be so high as to be oppressive   Plainly

FCAFC  html  In Schneider Electric  Australia  Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCAFC         FCR      Schneider v ACCC    Sackville J said at        Secondly  I would not place particular emphasis on the size of Schneider s Australian business  as such  as an additional factor distinguishing it from WTC and Tyree  Schneider s size and profitability doubtless explain why it did not dispute its capacity to pay any penalty that might reasonably be expected to be imposed and  to that extent  its size has already been taken into account  As I have said  from the point of view of deterrence  it is the nature of the contravening conduct that is the central determinant in determining an appropriate penalty  The size of a corporation may bear on the assessment of the seriousness of the contravening conduct  as when a large corporation has substantial market power which it uses to intimidate or cajole others to join in contravening conduct   The Commission submitted that although the penalties sought for Safeway s contraventions were substantial  the penalties were appropriate having regard to the available maximum and the importance of deterring the abuse of market power that is the essence of s    The Commission relied on the observations of Finkelstein J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission   Distribution Ltd  No       ALR   at          antitrust legislation is founded on the underlying premise that free competition is essential for the welfare of the state  Conduct that affects the public  such as the anti competitive behaviour that is outlawed by the Trade Practices Act   can never really be considered as anything other than serious    and Merkel J on appeal in Schneider v ACCC at            it is appropriate to emphasise the need to ensure that penalties are not fixed in sums that do not have adequate regard to the nature and extent of the contravention  the losses caused by the contravention and the need to deter not only the offending parties but also others from engaging in similar conduct    I agree with these observations   In the present circumstances  I consider it of little relevance to the imposition of the penalties to take into account the fact that Safeway is a wholly owned subsidiary of a major public company  Safeway is a large company in its own right  At the relevant time it operated some   supermarkets in Victoria and Albury  It employed approximately   to   employees and had some   product lines and   suppliers  I adopt and apply the observation of Merkel J in Schneider v ACCC at      The size of a parent may be of relevance where  for example  the parent bore some responsibility for the subsidiary s conduct or where it is relevant to the subsidiary s capacity to meet a substantial pecuniary penalty  However  I do not regard the size of Schneider s parent company  or of the group of which it forms part  to be a relevant factor in the present case for three reasons  First  it is not suggested that the parent had any involvement in Schneider s contraventions  Second  Schneider did not put in issue its capacity to pay any penalty that may be imposed  Third  it is clear that Schneider operates a substantial business in Australia in its own right  In   it employed   employees and had an annual turnover in excess of   million  Since   other than in   it has regularly earned net annual profits before tax well in excess of   million  Thus  the present case is not one in which it is necessary to determine the circumstances in which the size of a parent of an offending subsidiary will be relevant to the quantum of the penalty that is appropriate   The relevant fact remains Safeway is a very large corporation  with a significant presence in the commercial community   The Commission submitted that the involvement of Mr Brookes  merchandise manager for Safeway  in the four s   incidents was an exacerbating factor that the Court ought to take into account in imposing penalties  The Commission said that Mr Brookes was directly involved in the Frankston incident as he made the decision to delete citedTrade

inevitable that different penalties will be imposed  Nevertheless it is necessary to bear in mind what is generally referred to as the parity principle  All other things being equal  similar conduct

regarded as inadequate   Safeway submitted that it should not be penalised more severely than the total penalties imposed on George Weston Foods Limited  Tip Top  in this proceeding  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd     FCR    I reject that submission  The only penalty imposed on Tip Top that could be relevant to any penalties imposed on Safeway is the contravention of s   at Preston Market  Tip Top s other contraventions were for contraventions of s   of the Act   There were no allegations of breach of s   as against Tip Top  It would be plainly wrong to compare penalties in circumstances where the contraventions relate to different sections of the Act and different types of conduct   Tip Top was ordered to pay   in respect of the making of the price fixing agreement and   in respect of the implementation of it  However  Safeway s contravention was substantially more serious than Tip Top  given that it was Safeway s conduct which brought about the events which led to the contravening conduct   Safeway identified nine matters which it submitted were significant when assessing the penalties against Tip Top        the contraventions were brought about by senior people in the Victorian division of Tip Top        none of the senior officers at Tip Top acted as a check or control on the others involved        the contraventions did not occur as result of one Tip Top officer acting on a frolic of his own        Tip Top operated a compliance program which made clear that the contraventions were strictly prohibited and could be the subject of severe penalties  and the program was found to be ineffective and was ignored or disregarded        it was because the compliance program was disregarded by senior officers that a significant deterrent element was required        the size of George Weston Foods Ltd  Tip Top  was significant as its commercial activity permeated the commercial and consumer life of the public        Tip Top s conduct in resale price maintenance was engaged in with a conscious appreciation that it was intended to ensure that the discounting of bread by retailers was discouraged or prevented  and was aimed directly towards small businesses        Tip Top s conduct was deliberate and systematic and engaged in for commercial reasons  Tip Top  on the agreed facts  anticipated Safeway s reaction and did not seek to resist Safeway  and       with respect to the Preston market incident  the contravention of s   was  on the agreed facts  admitted and the agreement on prices was reached at senior management level   Although these matters were particularly relevant to the fixing of penalties against Tip Top there are many points of difference between Tip Top s contraventions and Safeway s contraventions and their respective circumstances which render comparison of little value   In having regard to all of the above factors  I have nevertheless borne in mind the totality principle  That is  I have ensured that having determined an appropriate penalty for each contravention  I have  as a check considered whether the aggregate is appropriate for the various acts of contravening conduct involved  McDonald v The Queen     FCR   and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd   ATPR     at   citedAustralian Competition

parties but also others from engaging in similar conduct    I agree with these observations citedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum  No       ALR   As a result of the Preston Market incident consumers paid more for bread at the Preston Market stall and were denied the benefit of competition in relation to branded bread  This incident was inherently anti competitive  although the extent of the anti competitive consequence cannot be quantified  That does not alter the significance of the contravention  As Merkel J observed in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum  No       ALR   at      Any determination of the actual quantum of the higher retail prices paid for petrol by reason of the understanding would necessarily be speculative and would be unlikely to serve any useful purpose  The important point is that price fixing arrangements and understandings of the kind made and given effect to in the present case have been treated by the legislature as per se contraventions of the Act because their inherently anti competitive nature inevitably harms consumers and has a deleterious and pernicious effect on economic efficiency  appliedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd   ATPR     The observations of Selway J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v McMahon Services Pty Ltd   ATPR     are also pertinent in this context  At   Selway J said          T he actual market outcome in a particular case is not necessarily an important issue in determining the appropriate penalty  except  perhaps  as a matter of aggravation  In relation to price fixing agreements  the law itself assumes that the purpose and or the effect of the proscribed behaviour is to  substantially lessen competition  s  A of the TPA and see Brunt Economic Essays on Australian and New Zealand Competition Law   at    Given that assumption  it cannot be a factor in mitigation of a pecuniary penalty for engaging in price fixing that no such purpose or effect occurred in the particular case  If it is true that the uncompetitive purpose and effect did not result in a measurable or ascertainable loss to a particular individual  that is necessarily fortuitous and coincidental  It is not a matter of mitigation  Further  as already noted  the reason for the prohibition is the effect of the behaviour on the overall market  not on a particular transaction  Collusive bidding practices are unacceptable whatever their effect in a particular transaction  Those involved in them must expect significant penalties   With respect to the Preston Market incident  consumers were affected in a true economic sense as the price fixing arrangement resulted in consumers paying a higher price for bread at the Preston Market stall   The Commission submitted that Safeway did not have any substantial trade practices compliance program in place  and to the extent it had any at all  it was ineffective  The Commission contended that Safeway did not call evidence or tender any contemporaneous documents that showed any substantial or systematic program of compliance at the time of the contraventions appliedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v SIP Australia Pty Limited   ATPR     I also draw in aid the approach I took in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v SIP Australia Pty Limited   ATPR     at        There is no basis for considering that there should be any parity with  or relationship between  the penalties imposed upon Baker Bros and its two directors and the penalties to be imposed upon SIP and Mr Ippaso  In the present circumstances there are significant differences between the position of Baker Bros and its directors on the one hand and SIP and Mr Ippaso on the other  In particular  Baker Bros admitted its contraventions at a very early stage of the proceeding  as did its directors in relation to their participation in those contraventions  Baker Bros was a much smaller company than SIP by reference to factors such as financial resources and commercial resources generally and SIP s market share between   and   and its turnover were significantly greater than Baker Bros  turnover  Further  Baker Bros and its two directors actively co operated with the Commission in finalising the case against them and assisting it in prosecuting its case against SIP and Mr Ippaso  Although SIP and Mr Ippaso co operated with the Commission when s   notices were served on them  they contested the proceeding  They are not to be penalised for so doing but they are not entitled to any discount in respect of co operating with the Commission so as to obviate the necessity for a trial  Further  although Baker Bros committed the contraventions  it did so only after significant commercial pressure was placed upon Messrs Baker by Mr Ippaso  The role played by Mr Ippaso and SIP in procuring and implementing the March   agreement was significantly different in that it was the initiating factor and the factor which drove the negotiations which culminated in the agreement  This difference warrants SIP and Mr Ippaso being given significantly and substantially greater penalties than Baker Bros and their directors  Mr Ippaso s culpability is significantly greater than that of the two directors of Baker Bros      I am therefore satisfied that a more substantial penalty should be imposed upon SIP and Mr Ippaso than was imposed upon Baker Bros and Messrs Baker   There are significant differences between the position of Tip Top and the position of Safeway  On one view comparing their positions is akin to comparing apples with oranges  In particular  Tip Top admitted the contraventions at an early stage and co operated with the Commission and so became entitled to a significant discount in the penalties to be imposed  Further  the penalties imposed upon Tip Top were based on an agreed statement of facts  which were not tested by cross examination  It is inappropriate to use those facts  which were agreed  as relevant to Safeway s position in this penalty hearing   The allegations against Tip Top were contraventions of ss   and     and not s    The contraventions differed in fundamental ways      Tip Top s contraventions did not involve the exercise of substantial market power  whereas it was a fundamental element of Safeway s four s   incidents that it both had  and took advantage of  market power in order to deter or prevent competitive conduct        Tip Top s conduct was a response to the deletion of its products by Safeway  In the four incidents  Safeway s purpose was to deter or prevent supply  whereas Tip Top did not have such a purpose citedTrade Practices Commission v Carlton United Breweries Ltd     FCR

FCAFC         FCR   and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Fila Sport Oceania Pty Ltd  Administrators Appointed    ATPR       ACCC v Fila   in support   Safeway submitted that if the penalties sought by the Commission are imposed  such penalties would be in stark contrast to those imposed in the ACCC v Fila decision  given that the contraventions in that case were more damaging  intentional  sustained and widespread  In ACCC v Leahy I said at          All other things being equal  similar conduct should be deserving of similar penalties   It is also desirable to bear in mind the penalties that have been imposed in past cases  A dramatic departure from previous practice might be seen as representing unjustifiable disparity but may also demonstrate that a level or quantum of previous penalties may  now in the present circumstances under consideration  be regarded as inadequate    Little attention has been paid in recent times to the level or quantum of penalty appropriate for contraventions of s   of the Act    There are several difficulties in the application of the parity principle  The first is that all of the authorities referred to by the parties differ in some way  and in some instances many ways from the present circumstances  I do not consider that it is useful to use any one case as a determinant of the quantum of penalty for another   Secondly  a number of the authorities referred to were decided when the maximum penalty for corporations for contraventions of ss   and   was    This is in contrast to the maximum penalty of   million that is now available  If an appropriate case were identified  the question arises as to how one compares a penalty that was imposed at a time when the maximum penalty was different  The Commission approached the issue on a percentage basis  and identified what percentage of the maximum penalty was imposed  I doubt that this is the correct approach  as the Court is not engaged in a mathematical exercise in which precise calculations are derived from specified or identified integers  Rather the Court is engaged in a weighing and balancing exercise appliedMill v The Queen   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The  totality  principle requires the Court  after determining an appropriate sentence or penalty for specific offences or contraventions in accordance

The total of penalties fixed for separate and discrete contraventions of Pt IV of the Act should not be disproportionate to the severity and significance of the various contraventions which have been

pursuant to s   of the Act is a matter for the Court  When a court is presented with an agreed penalty  the proper task is to determine whether the proposed penalty comes within the permissible range  NW Frozen Foods at     per Burchett and Kiefel JJ and Minister for Industry  Tourism and Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd   ATPR     per Branson  Sackville and Gyles JJ at     I have considered whether it is appropriate to give Mr Jones any discount in penalty by virtue of his admission of the contravention at Preston market  Once the Full Court made its findings with respect to Mr Jones  role in the Preston market incident  Mr Jones had little option but to admit liability  In those circumstances  it cannot be said that Mr Jones  admission has saved any substantial amount of court time   There was no evidence before me as to Mr Jones  financial position  Accordingly I am unable to take into account the ability of Mr Jones to pay any particular penalty
