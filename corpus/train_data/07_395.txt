HCA         CLR   the High Court said  at        The finding made by Hill J  set out above  was criticised both in the Full Court and in this Court on the ground that  as the case was particularised by the Commissioner  the persons who entered into or carried out the scheme were CPIL UK  MLG and ACP  They were the persons referred to in s  D  not some unidentified advisors  There is no point in making a finding about what would be concluded concerning the purpose of an advisor unless that purpose is then attributed to a relevant person  It is reasonably clear that  albeit in a slightly elliptical fashion  Hill J was doing that  He was justified in doing so  As was mentioned above  it is to be expected that those who participate in a complex  international  commercial transaction will be concerned about its tax implications  and will seek expert advice  Attributing the purpose of a professional advisor to one or more of the corporate parties in the present case is both possible and appropriate  In some cases  the actual parties to a scheme subjectively may not have any purpose  independent of that of a professional advisor  in relation to the scheme or part of the scheme  but that does not defeat the operation of s  D  If  in the present case  there had been evidence which showed that no director or employee of any member of the Group had ever heard of s  D  that would not conclude the matter in favour of the taxpayer  One of the reasons for making s  D turn upon the objective matters listed in the section  it may be inferred  was to avoid the consequence that the operation of Pt IVA depends upon the fiscal awareness of a taxpayer   The applicant referred to the decision of Stone J in Cooke v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     ATR   and submitted that arrangements of which the taxpayer is unaware are not part of the scheme for the purposes of s  D b  and therefore should not be considered when addressing the matters in s  D b   However  on appeal in Commissioner of Taxation v Cooke     ATR   the Full Court of this Court did not agree  The Court said  at        The primary judge found that the evidence of the respondents was to the effect that at the time of making their respective investments  they knew nothing about the transactions identified in the emphasized passage in the preceding paragraph  Upon that footing  her Honour accepted the submission of the respondents that those transactions could not be part of any scheme  and purported to apply the dictum of Blanshard J of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v BNZ Investments Limited     NZTC   at   to the effect that a taxpayer s ignorance of the arrangements the subject of an income tax avoidance scheme renders the New Zealand anti avoidance legislation unavailable to the New Zealand revenue authority  However as was pointed out in Howland Rose at   Part IVA of the Tax Act is distinguishable from the New Zealand legislation in that regard  Thus in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd   HCA         CLR   in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ at   it was

decision of the High Court in Hart in which Gummow and Hayne JJ said  at        The bare fact that a taxpayer pays less tax  if one form of transaction rather than another is made  does not demonstrate that Pt IVA applies  Simply to show that a taxpayer has obtained a tax benefit does not show that Pt IVA applies  With these considerations in mind  it is sometimes said that it is necessary to read Pt IVA in a way that will not bring  ordinary  transactions to tax  It is obvious that the content of such a proposition turns entirely upon what is meant by  ordinary    The applicant s criticism of the Tribunal member s reasoning is misconceived  The Tribunal member was addressing one of the eight matters in s  D b  and the conclusion he drew that  but for Part IVA  the applicant would enjoy tax benefits by way of the income tax deductibility of the expenses was undoubtedly correct  He said that that supported the conclusion that the applicant s prevailing purpose was to obtain tax benefits in connection with the scheme  but he did not say that it was decisive  There is no error in that approach   The Tribunal member found that the project was commercially viable  had been successful and that there was no reason to doubt that it would be successful to its conclusion  The income received by the applicant from the project to the date of the hearing before the Tribunal had exceeded   and was within     per cent of prospectus forecasts after seven years  The Tribunal member found that if the project continued to perform according to prospectus forecasts  the applicant will make a substantial profit from his business consideredCommissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Section  D

conclusion drawn from a consideration of all matters may support a conclusion of a dominant purpose to obtain tax benefits in connection with the scheme   Sleight at       Calder at       In   above I have identified the Tribunal member s conclusion with respect to this matter and the fact that he said the six matters he identified did not  diminish  the finding that the applicant s prevailing purpose was to obtain tax benefits in connection with the scheme  The applicant submits the Tribunal member should have found that the six matters negated a finding of a prevailing purpose of obtaining tax benefits  or at the least diminished it   It is important to appreciate the reasoning of the Tribunal member  He identified features relevant to the manner in which the scheme was entered into or carried out  He decided  after considering those features  that a conclusion of a dominant purpose of obtaining tax benefits should be drawn  With respect  the Tribunal member s use of the word  diminished  is not entirely felicitous  but I think  reading his reasons as a whole  it is clear what he meant  I do not think he was saying the six matters should not be considered or should not be weighed in the balance  In my opinion  all the Tribunal member was saying was that weighing them in the balance they did not dissuade him from reaching the conclusion that  in relation to the manner in which the scheme was entered into or carried out  the applicant s prevailing purpose was to obtain tax benefits in connection with the scheme   The Tribunal member was entitled to have regard to the round robin arrangements in concluding that the applicant s prevailing purpose was to obtain tax benefits  The weight he placed on the matter is unclear but ultimately that was a matter for him  and the applicant s case is not advanced by referring to another case where a Judge said that he was not inclined to place a great deal of weight on the round robin arrangements Sleight at     per Hill J    The Tribunal member did not err in law in his approach to the manner in which the scheme was entered into or carried out  and the conclusions he reached in relation to that matter were reasonably open to him   The Tribunal member said that the form of the scheme was one whereby the applicant conducted a business of growing wine grapes and using a limited recourse loan  whereas the substance of the scheme was a passive investment which  but for the tax benefits  would ordinarily have been cast in a different form  He said that that difference pointed to a prevailing purpose on the part of the applicant to obtain tax benefits   The approach taken by the Tribunal member in relation to this matter was consistent with the approach taken in decisions of this Court  In Sleight   Hill J said  at           There is a difference between the form and the substance of the present scheme  In form there is an option whether to farm alone or to employ the management company  There is a management agreement and financing and interest payments  The form  involving prepayment of management fee and interest is  it may be concluded readily  designed to increase the taxation deductions available to an investor  The substance is  however  quite different  As senior counsel for the Commissioner put it  in substance the investor is a mere passive investor in what  once the tax features are removed  is a managed fund where no deduction would be available  or perhaps an alternative characterisation of the substance of the scheme is an investment in shares in the Land Company which at the expiration of   years is to own the tea tree plantation      With respect to the learned primary judge it is not correct to say that form and substance are the same  Rather the particular shape the investment took was clearly fashioned in a way that would maximise the tax deductions  They were geared up by the loan agreement with up front interest payments  But for the tax deductions the form the investment might be expected to take would clearly relate more to the substance of what happened  Rather than a loan with prepaid interest where the loan was to be repaid out of the investor s profit share without recourse  achieved through the indemnity agreement  the substance is that the investor was to receive only a lesser share of profit over the term of the loan agreement  The loan allowed  also  the prepayment of the management fee and the deduction which emanated from that      I refer also to the Full Court s decision in Calder  at           I did not understand the applicant to challenge the Tribunal member s conclusions in relation to this matter   The Tribunal member said that the matter must be considered as at the date the scheme was entered into and he referred to the reasons of Carr J in Sleight at          The applicant did not take issue with that approach   The applicant s first submission in relation to the Tribunal member s reasons in relation to this matter was that he had made an error in concluding that  according to the projections  the applicant would begin to derive after tax returns in   that is  after   years  The applicant submitted that this was wrong and that the projections indicated after tax returns after six years  As I understand the projections  the applicant is right in the sense that after about six years there are after tax returns before repayments of the loan are taken into account  If repayments of the loan are taken into account there are only after tax returns after   years   I have no doubt that the Tribunal member did not misunderstand the effect of the projections  Earlier in his reasons he summarised the position accurately as follows     Moreover  until   tax savings were  in substance  the only source of returns to the participant as follows         a  From     the participant s returns were the result of tax savings which more than covered the cash payments required of him pursuant to the loan     b  From     the project was expected to generate revenue of its own  However  in those years  the structure of the loan resulted in neutral cashflows to the participant who  after meeting his loan obligations was to be paid enough only to meet anticipated tax obligations     c  Only in the latter years of the project      when the loan was paid off  was the project expected to be cashflow positive to the participant by reason of revenue received from the proceeds of the project itself  consideredCooke v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     ATR   The applicant referred to the decision of Stone J in Cooke v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     ATR   and submitted that arrangements of which the taxpayer is unaware are not part of the scheme for the purposes of s  D b  and therefore should not be considered when addressing the matters in s  D b   However  on appeal in Commissioner of Taxation v Cooke     ATR   the Full Court of this Court did not agree  The Court said  at        The primary judge found that the evidence of the respondents was to the effect that at the time of making their respective investments  they knew nothing about the

        CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  There is no doubt that  as the Tribunal member found  the round robin arrangements were legally effective  Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan
