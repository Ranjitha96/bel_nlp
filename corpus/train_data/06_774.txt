Luxottica Retail Australia Pty Limited v Carr   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAustralian Securities and Investment Commission v Edensor Nominees Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The power expressly vested in the Supreme Court by s   of the Restraints of Trade Act may be exercised by this Court when determining a controversy within its jurisdiction to which the Act is relevant   Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Edensor Nominees Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR    No party addressed me on the relevance for present purposes of the requirement in s   of the Act for an application to be made by a person subject to the restraint   Luxottica did not place reliance on s   and s   of the Corporations Act   or on any alleged breach of fiduciary duties owed by Mr Carr to Luxottica  It relied only upon alleged breaches of his contract of employment   In my view  the evidence placed before the Court was insufficient to sustain an inference that Mr Carr has breached  or threatens to breach  clause   of his contract of employment appliedCastlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  To obtain the interlocutory relief which it seeks Luxottica must demonstrate three things     a  that there is a serious question to be tried   b  that it will suffer irreparable injury for which damages will not be adequate compensation  and  c  that the balance of convenience favours the grant of interlocutory relief   Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason ACJ    To some extent these three things overlap and it is not uncommon for the adequacy of damages as compensation to be considered as an aspect of the balance of convenience   For the reasons set out below I am not satisfied that Luxottica is entitled to interlocutory relief against either Mr Carr or Hinkler   Mr Carr signed a contract of employment with OPSM Pty Ltd on   June    The contract is governed by the law of New South Wales  The ACN of OPSM Pty Ltd shown on the contract is the ACN of Luxottica as shown on its application  OPSM Pty Ltd must be assumed to have changed its name to Luxottica after   June     The degree of likelihood of success in Luxottica s case is a relevant consideration in assessing the balance of convenience   Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia at    The evidence reveals that every existing optometry business in Bundaberg is within a radius of five kilometres of the Sugarland premises  For this reason it is likely to be argued at trial that the maximum geographic restraint sought to be imposed on Mr Carr by clause   is unreasonable and constitutes an attempt to prevent his practising at all in Bundaberg other than with Luxottica  The second level of geographic restraint for which clause   provides is within a radius of three kilometres of the Sugarland premises  The Hinkler premises are outside this radius   I am not satisfied that  to the extent that Luxottica s case against Mr Carr depends on the five kilometre radius restraint for which clause   provides  if the evidence remains as it is  it is probable  as opposed to possible  that Luxottica will be held entitled to relief   Luxottica contended that the quasi medical nature of optometry renders it likely that Mr Carr s clients will follow him with the result that he  together with Hinkler  will gain an unjustifiable headstart or  springboard  as competitors of Luxottica unless interlocutory relief is granted  Luxottica also argued that it will be difficult for it to recruit another qualified optometrist citedGeraghty v Minter   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  However  I accept that there is a serious question to be tried as to the extent of the restraint of trade validly imposed on Mr Carr by clause   of his contract of employment and as to whether he is in breach of that restraint  While an employer is not entitled to be protected from mere competition from a former employee  it is entitled to protect the goodwill of its business and  for that purpose  to prevent the former employee from misusing his or her acquaintance with the employer s customers and taking advantage of the employer s trade connections   Geraghty v Minter   HCA         CLR    The Restraints of Trade Act will ensure the validity of clause   to the extent that it is not contrary to public policy   Luxottica contended that damages will not be an adequate remedy should it succeed in its action against Mr Carr  It argued that its loss and damage will be unquantifiable because of the difficulties that will attend the establishment of a causal link between Mr Carr s breach of clause   of his contract of employment and loss of profits by Luxottica   Mr Carr has sworn that he does not have a list of the customers of Luxottica s Sugarland business and does not know who are the customers of that business  He has offered to keep a record of every customer who he examines and a record of all charges rendered in respect of each customer including charges for spectacles  This record will  in my view  go a significant way towards overcoming the problems which Luxottica foresees in establishing its damages should it succeed against Mr Carr at trial citedIndustrial Rollformers Pty Ltd v Ingersoll Rand  Australia  Ltd   Aust Contract Reports     Section   of the Restraints of Trade Act    NSW  provides that a restraint of trade is valid to the extent to which it is not against public policy  whether it is in severable terms or not  Section   of the Act authorises a person subject to a restraint of trade to apply to the Supreme Court of New South Wales where the operation of a restraint of trade would have a manifestly unreasonable operation  In Industrial Rollformers Pty Ltd v Ingersoll Rand  Australia  Ltd   Aust Contract Reports       NSWCA   the Court of Appeal observed that s   does not authorise the remaking of the restraint  rather  where there is a postulated breach of the restraint  it permits the Court to enforce the restraint to the extent that is reasonable in the circumstances of the postulated breach
