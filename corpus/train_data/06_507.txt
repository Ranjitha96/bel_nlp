MZXEF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  with Corrigendum dated   June     FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldiscussedM  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The matter was remitted to the Federal Court and heard as proceeding VID   of    Following a direction by a Registrar of the Court  on   November   the appellants filed an amended application under s  A of the Migration Act    the Act   and s  B of the Judiciary Act     That application  which was heard in the first instance by Sundberg J  alleged that the RRT fell into jurisdictional error by considering out of date country information  The appellants  written contentions of fact and law repeated this claim  By a decision delivered   November   Sundberg J dismissed the application for review  His Honour said  in M  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     at   and      As can be seen  when the Tribunal was considering the applicant s claims as to what happened to her in   and thereafter  it considered information contemporaneous with the times  It would have been irrelevant to consider current information about Sri Lanka in assessing the state of the country after the events were said to have occurred  When it was considering the real chance of persecution on return  it had regard to current information about the country          It is to be remembered that the weight to be attributed to country information is a matter for the Tribunal  not for the Court  discussedM  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The appellants appealed to a Full Court of this Court  The Full Court said  in M  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC     at     as follows     In a notice of appeal filed on   December   the appellant effectively repeated the ground raised before the primary judge  That is  it was alleged that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error by considering dated and not recent country information and the primary judge erred in not concluding that the Tribunal had fallen into jurisdictional error      For the reasons given by the primary judge  this contention is without substance   The Full Court also discussed the appellants  additional submissions  which sought to raise the  medically unfit  ground mentioned in the draft order nisi filed in the High Court  The Court said  at        In written submissions  the  first  appellant raised a number of additional issues  They included that she had been denied procedural fairness because she had been required to attend the hearing before the Tribunal at a time when she was medically unfit  The appellant also contended  in effect  that the Tribunal failed to take into account her mental state when assessing her evidence and  in particular  when considering the significance of her inability to name the Tamil boarders she claimed to have taken in during        It is apparent from the Tribunal s reasons that the hearing was delayed for three months at the appellant s request because of a psychologist s report concerning the mental health of the appellant  That report recommended that the appellant should receive treatment for her condition in the interim  After the three months had passed  the Tribunal asked the appellant to attend a hearing on   May   but  at the appellant s request  made on   May   delayed that hearing until   May    The Tribunal refused to delay the hearing for a longer period  It did so on the ground that the psychologist  although stating that the appellant still suffered from the same condition  reported that the appellant had not sought the recommended treatment  The appellant attended the delayed hearing with her legal representative      The appellant s amended application and written submissions before the primary Judge were prepared by counsel  That application and those submissions appear to have abandoned a complaint made in the draft order nisi that the appellant was denied procedural fairness  and that the Tribunal failed to follow procedures required by  the Act   and misconceived its duty  because the hearing before the Tribunal took place when she was suffering from a mental disability  It may well be that the matter was not pursued in either the application or submissions because those advising the appellant considered a denial of procedural fairness was not a ground available under the then legislative regime      The allegation of denial of procedural fairness is not raised in the notice of appeal  However it is relatively clear the notice was prepared by the appellant without legal assistance      A full investigation of the consequences of any mental illness the appellant might have suffered at the time of the hearings before the Tribunal  would almost certainly have involved evidence being led before the primary judge  It was not  referred toMZXEF v Minister for Immigration   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  The learned Federal Magistrate found   MZXEF v Minister for Immigration   FMCA   at      T  here is little doubt that in this case the issues now sought to be agitated     are substantially the same as the issues which had been initially before the primary judge in the first application and in any event  which had been considered by the Full Court of the Federal Court on appeal from that decision     Accordingly  his Honour found that the doctrine of res judicata applied and that the review application should be summarily dismissed  The Federal Magistrate held  in the alternative  that the application constituted an abuse of process and could also be dismissed on that basis   The notice of appeal was broad and unparticularised  It was  however  accompanied by an affidavit sworn by the first appellant on   February    The principal grounds of appeal raised by the appellants appear in this affidavit and in the appellants  written submissions filed on   April    These grounds were    that the first appellant was medically unfit to give evidence in support of her application before the RRT and was therefore denied procedural fairness and her rights under s   of the Act   and   that the RRT failed to consider up to date country information   On the hearing of the appeal  the first appellant reiterated both grounds and gave the Court copies of a document containing recent information on the situation in Sri Lanka referred toMZWHW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  This is the second occasion in which the appellants have instituted proceedings for the judicial review of the RRT s decision in January    The grounds or proposed grounds were   the RRT s reliance on out of date country information and   save before Sundberg J  the first appellant s medical condition at the time of the hearing  At first instance and on appeal  the appellants were unsuccessful  The RRT s reliance on country information was the subject of Sundberg J s and the Full Court s consideration  The appellants seek to raise again the very same ground  I accept the first respondent s submission that there is no error shown in his Honour s conclusion that res judicata applied to preclude the appellants from pursuing a second judicial review application on this ground  Res judicata can operate as a bar to a judicial review application in these circumstances  see MZWHW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     MZWHW   at   referring to Re Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR     Wong   at     The Federal Magistrate s decision was  so it seems to me  a final decision  see MZWHW

Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR   This is the second occasion in which the appellants have instituted proceedings for the judicial review of the RRT s decision in January    The grounds or proposed grounds were   the RRT s reliance on out of date country information and   save before Sundberg J  the first appellant s medical condition at the time of the hearing  At first instance and

Affairs   FCA     MZWHW   at   referring to Re Wong v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR     Wong   at     The issue concerning the first appellant s medical condition formed part of the appellants  application in the High Court and a ground  or proposed ground  of appeal in the Full Court  The Full Court gave detailed consideration to the  medically unfit  ground in determining whether  if an application to adduce further evidence were made  there would be any basis for the grant of leave  In substance  the Court held that there was no basis for the grant because the proposed ground was untenable in light of what had occurred at the RRT hearing  Even if this were insufficient to attract res judicata because directed to a different issue  namely  whether there was any basis to grant leave to adduce further evidence  from that which arises here  the history of the various proceedings instituted by the appellants discloses that his Honour correctly held the proceeding in the Federal Magistrates Court constituted an abuse of process  This is because  to the extent the appellants relied on the  medically unfit  ground  these second judicial review proceedings would attract an Anshun estoppel  see Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR    Such an estoppel bars a party from raising any point which properly belonged to the subject of earlier litigation that the party  exercising reasonable diligence  might have brought forward at the time of the earlier proceeding  Plainly enough  the  medically unfit  ground might have been brought forward for Sundberg J s consideration  Nothing has been established that would attract the discretion that forms part of the Anshun estoppel doctrine  see generally
