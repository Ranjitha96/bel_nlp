Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn cases where an applicant claims that he or she was authorised at a meeting of members of a native title claim group  it will often be necessary to consider the notice given of the meeting in order to determine if all members of the claim group were given a reasonable opportunity to participate in the decision making process  In the context of an application under s  B of the NTA  French J in Bolton on behalf of the Southern Noongar Families v State of Western Australia   FCA   said  at     In relation to the present motions I regret to say that the evidence and the processes adopted were not adequate to meet the conditions necessary for an order under s  B  For each of the applications there is a defined native title claim group which is set out earlier in these reasons  The connection between those who attended the various meetings referred to and the respective native title claim groups was not established either in respect of notification nor  more importantly  in respect of attendance  The native title claim groups are defined in each case by reference to apical ancestors and biological descendants of those persons and persons adopted by them  The advertisements and notices did not refer to the relevant native title claim groups except by use of the generic title of the applications in question  The membership of the native title claim group by those who attended each meeting was not demonstrated  Rather it was reported as an asserted self identification  Mrs Morich made some statements from the bar table doubting the representativeness of those who attended at the Southern Noongar meeting  Her statements might be right or wrong  They were not evidence  But my inability to make any judgment about them illustrates the inadequacy of the evidence as it presently stands for the purposes of a s  B application  And even if it be accepted that each of the members who attended each of the meetings was a member of the relevant native title claim group  it is not established that they were in any sense representative of the various components of the native title claim group concerned  I turn now to apply the relevant legal principles to the facts of this case  Native title claim group A native title claim group consists of all those persons who  according to their traditional laws and customs  hold the common or group rights and interests comprising the particular native title claimed  The evidence in this case leads me to the conclusion that the Brown Family Group is a sub group or sub set of a native title claim group  The Brown Family Group  as defined in the original application  consisted of   persons  some of whom are deceased  Twelve or thirteen of the persons  including the applicant  are also listed as claimants or antecedents in the AM Y claim group  The applicant is the daughter of Ms Jessie Brown  a person who  with her descendants  is named as a member of the AM Y claim group  The persons named in the original application as part of the Brown Family Group included Mr Billy Brown  Ms Ida Brown  Ms Nellie Brown and Mr Johnny Wongan  The Brown Family Group  as defined in the amended application  consists of   persons and their descendants  but the four persons previously named have been removed and replaced by Mr Johnny Fatt  Ms Eva Fatt  Ms Beverly Fatt and Mr Ronald Fatt  In Attachment S in the amended application  the applicant provides an explanation for the changes in the composition of the Brown Family Group  She states  among other things  that Ms Nellie Brown has been excluded  as one of her granddaughters  Ms Maureen Williams  was on the AM Y governing committee and did not want to be part of the Brown Family Group   She states that Ms Edna Williams is Ms Nellie Brown s daughter  She also states that Mr Johnny Fatt  Ms Eva Fatt  Ms Beverly Fatt and Mr Ronald Fatt are children of Ms Nellie Brown and that they have agreed to be members of the Brown Family Group  The AM Y native title claim group is defined in the application made by that group as  those people  now living  who hold in common the body of traditional laws and customs governing the area the subject of the claim   Three groupings of persons are alleged to be members of the claim group  For present purposes  only part of the first group is relevant  The following sets of siblings  together with all their descendants are members of the native title claim group             Hazel Brown  Ricky Brown and Martha Edwards      Edna Williams  Johnny Fatt  Eva Fatt  Beverly Fatt and Ronald Fatt       Kelly Tjutatja Brown  Tommy Brown  Henry Brown  Jessie Brown and Billy Nungki Brown           David Brown  Bulla Brown  Annabel Lang  Ida Brown  Lucy Brown and Linda Brown  The Brown Family Group  as defined in the amended application  includes all of the persons in para     above  other than Ms Edna Williams  all of the persons in para     above  other than Mr Billy Nungki Brown  and  all of the persons in para      assuming  as appears to be the case  Ms Annabel Brown and Ms Annabel Lang are the same person  other than Ms Ida Brown  Mr Billy Brown and Ms Ida Brown are part of the Brown Family Group as defined in the original application  Secondly  the applicant asserts that she was authorised by a meeting of the Brown Family Group on   May    That was after the original application had been filed and before the amended application was filed  There are a number of reasons why it must be concluded that the events at the meeting held on   May   did not give rise to a valid and effective authorisation  First  none of Messrs David Brown  Bobby and Sammy Brown and Sandy Brian Buzzacott were given notice of the meeting and none of them authorise the applicant to make the application or deal with matters arising in relation to it  They  or at least some of them  appear to be part of the Brown Family Group and the failure to give them notice of the meeting is fatal to the applicant s claim that she has been authorised to make the application and deal with matters arising in relation to it  Even if she could overcome these difficulties  she faces other obstacles in the way of establishing a valid authorisation  There is no evidence that any advertisement or notice was given in respect of the meeting held on   May    Furthermore  as in Bolton   the connection between those who attended the meeting referred to and the native title claim group is not established in respect of attendance  The applicant called another meeting of the Brown Family Group on   November    That meeting was advertised in the  Coober Pedy Regional Times   The advertisement was in the following terms  GENERAL MEETING   BROWN FAMILY GROUP   GENERAL MEETING   Will be held on Saturday  November       pm at Lot   Chadwick Street  COOBER PEDY  For more information phone    In my opinion  this advertisement was deficient in terms of giving all members of the Brown Family Group notice of the meeting because it did not sufficiently identify the alleged native title claim group such that a person reading the advertisement could determine if he or she was  or may be  a member of the Brown Family Group  The applicant said that in addition to the advertisement  she sent out   letters to  Bfg claimants members  of the intention to hold a general meeting on   November    However  the identities of the addressees were not established  and copies of the letters were not put before the Court referred toColbung v The

absence of that requirement led  in some cases  to conflicting and overlapping claims all carrying with them the statutory right to negotiate in respect of the grant of mineral tenements and the compulsory acquisition by Commonwealth or state governments of native title rights and interests  Although many aspects of the   amendments were the subject of controversy in the public and
