au cases cth HCA  html  The power conferred by s   is a discretionary power which is not to be limited by the laying down of rules as to the manner of its exercise  Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission   HCA         CLR    Mason CJ  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ there observed  at     It is now accepted that superior courts have inherent power to grant declaratory relief  It is a discretionary power which  i t is neither possible nor desirable to fetter     by laying down rules as to the manner of its exercise   However  it is confined by the considerations which mark out the boundaries of judicial power  Hence  declaratory relief must be directed to the determination of legal controversies and not to answering abstract or hypothetical questions  The person seeking relief must have  a real interest  and relief will not be granted if the question  is purely hypothetical  if relief is  claimed in relation to circumstances that  have  not occurred and might never happen  or if  the Court s declaration will produce no foreseeable consequences for the parties    citations omitted  Given the functions entrusted to Comcare by the   Act  there can be no question but that Comcare has   a real interest   in securing the relief which is sought  Indeed  cl   to sch   of the   Act expressly provides that either Comcare or an investigator may apply for a declaration of contravention   The manner in which the Court is to inform itself as to whether or not there has been a breach of the   Act is not surprisingly left unspecified  Whether or not there has been a breach may involve  in some cases  a contested and lengthy hearing  Alternatively  and as in the present proceeding  the parties may provide to the Court a statement of agreed facts and limited further

Practices Commission v CSR Ltd   ATPR      When assessing the penalty to be imposed pursuant to s   of the   Act His Honour observed  at     The assessment of a penalty of appropriate deterrent value will have regard to a number of factors which have been canvassed in the cases  These include the following     The nature and extent of the contravening conduct     The amount of loss or damage caused     The circumstances in which the conduct took place     The size of the contravening company     The degree of power it has  as evidenced by its market share and ease of entry into the market     The deliberateness of the contravention and the period over which it extended     Whether the contravention arose out of the conduct of senior management or at a lower level     Whether the company has a corporate culture conducive to compliance with the Act  as evidenced by educational programs and disciplinary or other corrective measures in response to an acknowledged contravention     Whether the company has shown a disposition to co operate with the authorities responsible for the enforcement of the Act in relation to the contravention     These considerations have since been

edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In the statutory context of the present legislation  Madgwick J has focussed attention upon those considerations relevant to the imposition of a penalty in Comcare v Commonwealth   FCA       FCR    A member of the Australian Defence Force had there died in November   as a result of heat stress sustained during an army training exercise  His Honour there observed    Decisions under the cognate New South Wales Act refer to the following considerations among others   i  the penalty must be such as to compel attention to occupational health and safety generally  to ensure that workers whilst at work will not be exposed to risks to their health and safety   ii  it is a significant aggravating factor that the risk of injury was foreseeable even if the precise cause or circumstances of exposure to the risk were not foreseeable   iii  the offence may be further aggravated if the risk of injury is not only foreseeable but actually foreseen and an adequate response to that risk is not taken by the employer   iv  the gravity of the consequences of an accident does not of itself dictate the seriousness of the offence or the amount of penalty  However the occurrence of death or serious injury may manifest the degree of the seriousness of the relevant detriment to safety   v  a systemic failure by an employer to appropriately address a known or foreseeable risk is likely to be viewed more seriously than a risk to which an employee was exposed because of a combination of inadvertence on the part of an employee and a momentary lapse of supervision   vi  general deterrence and specific deterrence are particularly relevant factors in light of the objects and terms of the Act   vii  employers are required to take all practicable precautions to ensure safety in the workplace  This implies constant vigilance  Employers must adopt an approach to safety which is proactive and not merely reactive  In view of the scope of those obligations  in most cases it will be necessary to have regard to the need to encourage a sufficient level of diligence by the employer in the future  This is particularly so where the employer conducts a large enterprise which involves inherent risks to safety   viii  regard should be had to the levels of maximum penalty set by the legislature as indicative of the seriousness of the breach under consideration   xi  the neglect of simple  well known precautions to deal with an evident and great risk of injury  take a matter towards the worst case category   x  the objective seriousness of the offence  without more may call for the imposition of a very substantial penalty to vindicate the social and industrial policies of the legislation and its regime of penalties   These considerations  it was concluded    provide  d  useful  analogical  general guidance as to the approach to be taken in consideration of penalties under the Commonwealth Act    His Honour noted that the maximum penalty was   penalty units  a penalty of less than    The maximum penalty would be appropriate where there had been a   conscious decision to flout the law    A penalty of   penalty units   was ordered  His Honour found that there had been   systemic failures of the most serious kind   at     These considerations may also be applied to the task of assessing the penalty to be imposed under the current legislation  To some extent the considerations set forth by Madgwick J overlap with those set forth by French J  to some extent they do not   A final matter of principle should also be noted  It is inappropriate to fix a penalty simply by reference to the quantum of a penalty imposed in another case  It was thus understood to be common ground between the parties to the present proceeding that it was not appropriate to regard  in particular  the penalty of   in Comcare v Commonwealth as itself fixing a   benchmark   against which other penalties are to be determined in cases involving death  In NW Frozen Foods Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCA         FCR     Burchett and Kiefel JJ observed  at   A hallmark of justice is equality before the law  and  other things being equal  corporations guilty of similar contraventions should incur similar penalties  Trade Practices Commission v Axive Pty Ltd   ATPR      at    There should not be such an inequality as would suggest that the treatment meted out has not been even handed  cf the criminal law case Lowe v The Queen   HCA         CLR    However  other things are rarely equal where contraventions of the Trade Practices Act are concerned  In the present case  differing circumstances  size  market power and responsibility for the contraventions  as well as other factors  complicate any attempt to compare the penalties imposed on the appellant with those imposed on the other corporations  Another form of comparison is not appropriate  The facts of the instant case should not be compared with a particular reported case in order to derive therefrom the amount of the penalty to be fixed  Cases are authorities for matters of principle  but the penalty found to be appropriate  as a matter of fact  in the circumstances of one case cannot dictate the appropriate penalty in the different circumstances of another case  The point was well made by Spender J in Trade Practices Commission v Annand and Thompson Pty Ltd   ATPR      at   when he said       Each case must  of course  be viewed on its own facts and facts may be infinite in their variety       It follows  as his Honour also said  that  t he quantum of penalties imposed in other cases can seldom be of very much direct assistance    A comparison of the facts in Comcare v Commonwealth and the facts in the present proceeding only serves to underline the point there being made by Burchett and Kiefell JJ  and by Spender J     namely that the facts and circumstances of individual cases are infinitely diverse  The quantum of any penalty to be imposed must necessarily be fixed by reference to the peculiar facts arising in each case as and when they arise   In the present proceeding it is considered that an appropriate penalty is      that being the sum as agreed between the parties   In imposing that penalty  consideration has been given to both    the agreement as between the parties  and     the facts and circumstances as set forth in the Statement of Agreed Facts and such evidence as has been relied upon followedComcare v National Gallery of Australia   FCA       ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In Comcare v National Gallery of Australia   FCA       ALD   a penalty of   had been agreed between the parties and ordered by the Court  Whilst not downplaying the serious risks involved  the injuries sustained by the workers were relatively mild  Gyles J there further observed    All things considered  I am satisfied that the pecuniary penalty proposed is appropriate  As the cases indicate  it is not so much a question of me deciding what figure I would independently propose and then seeing whether it accords with the figure proposed  A commonsense approach is to take the agreed figure and give consideration to whether it is within the range of appropriate figures  In my opinion it is  I make the orders set out in the draft order which I have initialled and placed with the papers   Although the particular legislative regime which is being enforced must always remain the source whereby considerations relevant to the imposition of a penalty are to be discerned  there nevertheless remain some more general considerations that inform the discretion being exercised   Many other Commonwealth Acts provide for a regulator to approach this Court seeking an order for the imposition of a pecuniary penalty as a means of securing compliance with legislative provisions  A degree of learning has emerged from those authorities dealing with those other legislative provisions as to the matters to be taken into account when assessing a penalty   The extent to which this Court may inform itself as to the appropriate quantification of any penalty to be imposed by reference to any agreement between the parties has been the subject of consideration in the context of other legislation  eg  Secretary  Department of Health   Ageing v Pagasa Australia Pty Ltd   FCA   at      Reference was there made to the decision of the Full Court of this Court in Minister for Industry  Tourism   Resources v Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd   FCAFC   and to the earlier decision in NW Frozen Foods   The Full Court in Mobil Oil continued on to observe    The following propositions emerge from the reasoning in NW Frozen Foods   i  It is the responsibility of the Court to determine the appropriate penalty to be imposed under s   of the TP Act in respect of a contravention of the TP Act   ii  Determining the quantum of a penalty is not an exact science  Within a permissible range  the courts have acknowledged that a particular figure cannot necessarily be said to be more appropriate than another   iii  There is a public interest in promoting settlement of litigation  particularly where it is likely to be lengthy  Accordingly  when the regulator and contravenor have reached agreement  they may present to the Court a statement of facts and opinions as to the effect of those facts  together with joint submissions as to the appropriate penalty to be imposed   iv  The view of the regulator  as a specialist body  is a relevant  but not determinative consideration on the question of penalty  In particular  the views of the regulator on matters within its expertise  such as the ACCC s views as to the deterrent effect of a proposed penalty in a given market  will usually be given greater weight than its views on more  subjective  matters   v  In determining whether the proposed penalty is appropriate  the Court examines all the circumstances of the case  Where the parties have put forward an agreed statement of facts  the Court may act on that statement if it is appropriate to do so   vi  Where the parties have jointly proposed a penalty  it will not be useful to investigate whether the Court would have arrived at that precise figure in the absence of agreement  The question is whether that figure is  in the Court s view  appropriate in the circumstances of the case  In answering that question  the Court will not reject the agreed figure simply because it would have been disposed to select some other figure  It will be appropriate if within the permissible range   In Comcare v National Gallery of Australia   FCA   at       FCA       ALD   at   Gyles J referred to Mobil Oil and accepted that   that decision
