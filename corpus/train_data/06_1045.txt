cth HCA  htmlThe respondent says that this ground was not raised before Federal Magistrate Barnes and should not be permitted to be raised now for the first time on appeal as it is unmeritorious and there are no  exceptional circumstances  demonstrated by the appellant consistent with the observations of their Honours Gibbs CJ  Mason  Wilson  Brennan  Deane and Dawson JJ in Metwally v University

and Multicultural Affairs     ALR  In determining the question of whether leave should be given to file the proposed amended notice of appeal  it is necessary to give some consideration to the merits of the ground raised and consider whether the ground has a reasonable prospect of success  The strength of the prospect of success and the substance of the ground necessarily informs whether it is expedient and in the interests of justice that leave be given  See Gomez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     ALR   at    In relation to the question of whether the issue was raised before Federal Magistrate Barnes  her Honour noted at   that the application for review filed on   February   in the Federal Court contained  a number of generally expressed and unparticularised grounds   An amended application was filed on   March    A further amended application was filed on   June   and a further amended application was filed on   August    In this appeal  the appellant seeks leave to file an affidavit of Laura Rutter affirmed on   July   which annexes the application and each amended application  In order to complete the contextual record  I gave leave to read and file the affidavit of Ms Rutter in the appeal  No version of the application document raises  in terms  the ground now sought to be agitated by the appellant  The highest at which the matter might be put is that Federal Magistrate Barnes noted at   a claim by the appellant that he had been denied procedural fairness by the Tribunal  The content of that claim seems to be based upon an alleged failure on the part of the Tribunal to comply with ss  A and   of the Act  I am unpersuaded that the appellant raised the current contention in the earlier proceedings  The attempt to do so now raises the matter for the first time citedNAVX v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe underlying facts going to the ground were  however  examined by her Honour  At   her Honour considered the principles governing the decision by the Tribunal to proceed pursuant to s  A to make a decision on the review consequent upon the Tribunal s invitation to the appellant of   September   to appear before the Tribunal and the failure on the part of the appellant to appear on the nominated day and at the nominated time and place  The Tribunal said this       The Tribunal based its decision upon its lack of satisfaction on the material before it that the applicant met the applicable criteria  The findings that the Tribunal made were open to it on the material before it  The Tribunal was not obliged to accept at face value the applicant s claims  see SZDXC v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at      I note that in similar circumstances  where an applicant failed to appear before the Tribunal in the face of a letter such as the letter of   September   putting him on notice that the Tribunal was not prepared to make a favourable decision on the information before it  the Full Court of the Federal Court described rejection of the application for review as the  inevitable consequence  of the applicant s non attendance at the Tribunal hearing  see NAVX v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at        NAVX v MIMIA citedNASF v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlAt paragraphs     of the judgment  her Honour addressed the complaint made by the appellant that his migration agent had  put him into the dark  concerning the opportunity to appear before the Tribunal and thus the appellant had not been afforded procedural fairness  Apart from noting that the Tribunal had written to the appellant s migration agent and to the appellant at both residential addresses nominated in the documentation before the Tribunal  her Honour observed that NASF v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC     NASF v MIMIA  is authority for the proposition that no lack of procedural fairness or other jurisdictional error arises in circumstances where the Tribunal s invitation of   September   was sent in accordance with the requirements of the Act  No issue is raised concerning compliance with ss   or  A as the appellant responded to the invitation on   September   affirming a desire to appear  However  the appellant says that any reliance upon NASF v MIMIA in the context of the proposed ground of appeal is unsound because in that case a similar point of differentiation also arises namely  that the appellant s migration agent  in that case  had returned the form to the Tribunal stating that the appellant did not wish to attend the hearing before the Tribunal  Accordingly  it is not correct to describe either NAVX v MIMIA or NASF v MIMIA as authorities guiding or informing the exercise of the discretion conferred upon the Tribunal by s  A on the footing that they represent  similar circumstances   as Federal Magistrate Barnes observed at   quotedMinister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs v SZFHC   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe respondent concedes that these cases reflect a factual point of distinction from the circumstances of this case but it is a distinction without a difference as a matter of principle  In support of that notion  the respondent says that although s  A confers a discretion  it is a discretion to be exercised recognising that Division   of the Act contains an exhaustive statement of the natural justice hearing rule  that the course the Tribunal might take is unconstrained other than by reference to the language of the section and that Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs v SZFHC   FCAFC   at        MIMIA v SZFHC    is authority for the proposition that if the Tribunal complies with ss   and  A in inviting an applicant to appear before the Tribunal  the Tribunal is not required to make further enquiries if the applicant fails to attend  Whilst in MIMIA v SZFHC   the appellant failed to respond to a hearing invitation issued by the Tribunal and in NAVX v MIMIA and NASF v MIMIA   the respective appellant elected not to attend before the Tribunal in response to an invitation  these differences  it is said  do not give rise to any constraint upon the general principle identified by the respondent  It is common ground that the Tribunal complied with the requirements of the Act in inviting the appellant to appear before it and in issuing the notice  The exhaustive statement of the natural justice hearing rule requires the Tribunal  in the circumstances recited in ss   and  A to provide the appellant with an opportunity to appear before the Tribunal  to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review    The exercise of the power conferred by s  A upon the Tribunal to  make a decision on the review without taking any further action to allow or enable the applicant to appear before it  is  in terms  predicated only upon the conjunction of a complying invitation having issued to the appellant pursuant to s   to appear before the Tribunal and a failure on the part of the appellant to appear  on the day on which  or at the time and place at which  the appellant is scheduled to appear    The power to make a decision on the review consequent upon the conjunction of those events does not  however  prevent the Tribunal from taking a different course of  rescheduling the applicant s appearance before it  or from delaying its decision on the review in order to enable the applicant s appearance before it as rescheduled    Although I accept that the power conferred upon the Tribunal cannot be exercised capriciously and must be exercised reasonably  the election to make a decision on the review is not  by itself  the expression of an unreasonable exercise of the power  It is expressly contemplated by the section  If the evidence demonstrates in a particular case that the exercise of the power to make a decision on the review was capricious or wholly failed to take account of any matter put before it as to the reason for the failure on the part of the appellant to attend before the Tribunal  a question of procedural fairness might arise  This is not such a case  There seems to me to be no obligation falling upon the Tribunal to make any inquiry as to the failure on the part of the appellant to appear  In MIMIA v SZFHC   the applicant for a Protection Visa said that the Tribunal was on notice that he may not have received the invitation letter to attend before the Tribunal for the purposes of ss   and  A because the  Response to Hearing Invitation  form was not returned to the Tribunal because the letter addressed to the applicant s residential address was returned unclaimed and  in those circumstances  he did not appear at the hearing  Applicant SZFHC contended that in those circumstances an obligation fell upon the Tribunal to  find another method of contacting the respondent     Their Honours Spender  French and Cowdroy JJ at   said      it is clear that ss   and  A of the Migration Act are to be read together  Accordingly  the Tribunal  having complied with one of the methods prescribed in s  A  in fact  two  was under no further obligation to search the papers lodged with it to discover if there might be some other avenue of communicating with the applicant   citedXiang Sheng Li v Refugee Review Tribunal     ALD  The respondent says that in considering the question of whether the Tribunal ought to have rescheduled the appellant s appearance before it  an adjournment of the hearing upon the failure of the appellant to attend ought to have been granted because adjournments are more readily granted in inquisitorial proceedings   Xiang Sheng Li v Refugee Review Tribunal     ALD   at   per Moore J  the election to proceed to make a decision without taking any further action to enable the appellant to appear may involve procedural fairness on the ground that speed and peremptoriness may convey an inference that the Tribunal has failed to consider relevant material and engaged in a
