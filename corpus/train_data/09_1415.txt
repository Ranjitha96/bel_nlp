which had not been paid  see par   above  As Mandie J pointed out in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Plymin  supra  at   the mere fact of non payment of debts is a relevant factor to be taken into account in determining whether a company is insolvent  As I pointed out earlier  and as the authorities confirm  the determination of solvency is not done on a balance sheet basis but rather on a cashflow basis  This gives rise to the question what other sources of cash were available to the Company as at   December   and thereafter to enable it to pay debts then due and payable  Mr Carroll and Mr Cameron had ceased to advance money to the Company and the moneys which they had earlier advanced had been exhausted and used up  Mr Carroll submitted that the reason why the Company was not paying its debts as and when they became due and payable on and after   December   was not an inability to raise cash with which to pay its debtors  but  an apparent unwillingness  not inability  on his part to raise cash to pay the debts  It was submitted that Mr Carroll was unwilling to borrow money against the security of the Company s assets  was unwilling to inject fresh capital into the Company and was unwilling to sell down its timber stock on hand for anything less than its full perceived value  There is no evidence to support this submission  There were no assets of the Company which could be provided as security to support the borrowing of sufficient money to provide sufficient cash to discharge all the Company s debts then due and payable  None were

which the High Court considered the meaning of insolvency under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Barwick CJ  with whom McTiernan and Windeyer JJ agreed  said at              Insolvency is expressed in s    as an inability to pay debts as they fall due out of the debtor s own money  But the debtor s own moneys are not limited to his cash resources immediately available  They extend to moneys which he can procure by realization by sale or by mortgage or pledge of his assets within a relatively short time relative to the nature and amount of the debts and to the circumstances  including the nature of the business  of the debtor  The conclusion of insolvency ought to be clear from a consideration of the debtor s financial position in its entirety and generally speaking ought not to be drawn simply from evidence of a temporary lack of liquidity  It is the debtor s inability  utilizing such cash resources as he has or can command through the use of his assets  to meet his debts as they fall due which indicates insolvency  Whether that state of his affairs has arrived is a question for the Court and not one as to which expert evidence may be given in terms though no doubt experts may speak as to the likelihood of any of the debtor s assets or capacities yielding ready cash in sufficient time to meet the debts as they fall due  What is made clear in Sandell v Porter and restated in subsequent cases is that a temporary lack of liquidity does not mean that there is insolvency  As Mandie J pointed out in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Plymin  supra

nsw supreme ct  htmlThe cashflow test enables there to be taken into account in determining solvency or insolvency assets which are available to the Company which can be realised in order to answer indebtedness  However  there is a temporal limit upon this recourse  As Palmer J said in Hall v Poolman   NSWSC         ACSR   at         An asset cannot be taken into account in assessing solvency at a particular time without reference to the time it would realistically take to effect realisation and produce cash  It is no indication of solvency indeed  it is the opposite to point to property as available to meet debts falling due next month when  even with the utmost expedition  that property cannot be turned into cash for   months  Realisable property can only be taken into account in assessing solvency  if that property is in such a position as to title and otherwise that it could be realised in time to meet the indebtedness as the claims mature  Bank of Australasia v Hall   HCA         CLR   at   HCA         ALR   at   see  for example  Crema  Vic  Pty Ltd v Land Mark Property Developments  Vic  Pty Ltd     ACSR       VSC   at       per Dodds Streeton J and Noxequin Pty Ltd v DCT   NSWSC   at   and   per Barrett J            The liquidators have focused on what they say is a critical gap in the elements of Mr Irving s defence  In order for the defence to succeed  there must be an expectation  held on reasonable grounds  that recourse to assets will enable debts to be paid  not at some indefinite time in the future  but so as to keep the companies solvent according to the definition in s  A of the CA  namely  as the debts fall due to payment  It is not appropriate to base an expectation of solvency   Sheahan v Hertz Australia Pty Ltd     ACSR   at

debts as they become due not whether it might be able to do so in the future if given time to trade profitably                 The law recognises that there is sometimes no clear dividing line between solvency and insolvency from the perspective of the directors of a trading company which is in difficulties  There is a difference between temporary illiquidity and  an endemic shortage of working capital whereby liquidity can only restored  sic  by a successful outcome of business ventures in which the existing working capital has been deployed  Hymix Concrete Pty Ltd v Garritty     ALR   at     ACLR   at   Re Newark Pty Ltd  in liq  Taylor v Carroll     Qd R         ACSR    The first is an embarrassment  the second is a disaster  It is easy enough to tell the difference in hindsight  when the company has either weathered the storm or foundered with all hands  sometimes it is not so easy when the company is still contending with the waves  Lack of liquidity is not conclusive of insolvency  neither is availability of assets conclusive of solvency  Expo International Pty Ltd  in liq  v Chant     NSWLR   at     ACLR   at              Where a company has assets which  if realised  will pay outstanding debts and will enable debts incurred during the period of realisation to be paid as they fall due  the critical question for solvency is  how soon will the proceeds of realisation be available  see the authorities cited at   above  Bearing in mind the commercial reality that creditors will usually prefer to wait a reasonable time to have their debts paid in full rather than insist on putting the company into insolvency if it fails to pay strictly on time  I think it can be said  as a very broad general rule  that a director would be justified in  expecting solvency  if an asset could be realised to pay accrued and future creditors in full within about   days  Having regard to the authorities and principles to which I have referred  I am satisfied that as at   December   and thereafter throughout the whole of the relevant period up to   May   the Company was insolvent  I have reached this conclusion by approaching the matter from a number of different directions  Mr Carroll acknowledged that he knew that he had a cashflow shortage after   December    He also acknowledged that during the period from   December   to   May   the cashflow was tight in some months  He said that  some months the cashflow was very tight   In answer to the question whether the cashflow did not permit payment of superannuation contributions  he answered  yes   The significance of the time within which an asset can be realised in order to meet the liabilities of the Company was again emphasised in Hall v Poolman  supra  at par   see par   above  The existence or availability of assets is not an answer to a claim of insolvency in the absence of any indication as to when  and to what extent  those assets can be pledged or realised  In order to have assets taken into account in determining the issue of solvency on a cashflow basis  it is necessary to establish that those assets are readily realisable in a short space of time  Hall v Poolman  supra  at par    In the passage extracted at par   above  it is important to note that Palmer J referred to the realisation of an asset in  about   days  in order to pay not only accrued but also future creditors in full  Mr Carroll relied principally on the Company s inventory of stock to demonstrate the availability of a source from which cash could be obtained to pay existing debts  He submitted that in determining whether the Company was solvent at relevant times it was appropriate to take into account  and the Court was entitled to take into account  that at all relevant times it had timber stock on hand in excess in value of   million  Mr Carroll submitted that immediately prior to the commencement of the administration on   May   the value of the stock had increased to in excess of     million  Mr Carroll relied upon Mr Bright s evidence  which he submitted was uncontested  that the timber stock could be realised by the Company as a going concern within two months  He submitted this was within the three month period referred to in Hall v Poolman  supra  at par   as the broadly acceptable timeframe for realisation of assets to meet debts  The value of the stock was contentious between the parties and Mr Bright s evidence must be treated with caution  Mr Bright did not undertake a stocktake valuation of the stock himself  He said that he was required  to allocate a value  to the existing stock on hand and he did so on the basis of an inspection  He did not attempt to confirm or ascertain the value of the stock otherwise than by what he called  a cursory look   I do not consider that I should take into account the total  value  of the stock as set out in either of the balance sheets or the stocktake figures referred to by Mr Carroll in determining whether on the dates of the balance sheets and stocktakes the Company was able to pay all its debts as and when they fell due  I also adopt  with respect  the observation of Palmer J in Hall v Poolman  supra  at         Solvency is a question of fact and in finding whether or not a company was solvent at a particular point of time in the past the court does not proceed upon possibility or speculation as to what might have happened when it has clear evidence as to what did  in fact  happen      There was no other source available to the Company as at   December   and throughout the relevant period which could have assisted the cashflow position of the Company to enable it to pay its debts as and when they fell due at that time  Plant and equipment as at   December   had a value in the balance sheet of     and that value as at   May   was not much different  Mr Carroll said that the value of the plant and equipment in the Company s accounts was arrived at by Mr Bright but Mr Bright did not give any evidence to that effect  Mr Carroll gave evidence that around April   he had discussions regarding the obtaining of finance over equipment but these discussions did not proceed anywhere  There was no evidence before the Court that finance on the security of any of the plant and equipment of the Company was available  The next issue to determine is whether at the time the Company was insolvent there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that the Company was insolvent or would so become insolvent as the case may be  s  G c   The test prescribed by s  G c  is an objective test  Powell v Fryer   SASC         FLR     Hall v Poolman  supra  at    The concept of  suspecting  or  suspicion  involves having a state of mind which falls between having a firm belief or a significant degree of satisfaction that insolvency exists on the one hand and wondering whether it exists on the other  The concept of having a  suspicion  requires an affirmative feeling  Hall v Poolman  supra  at    The distinction was explained succinctly in Tourprint International Pty Ltd v Bott     ACSR   at          Expectation  as required by s  H  means a higher degree of certainty than  mere hope or possibility  or  suspecting   M Australia Pty Ltd v Kemish     ACLR   at   Dunn v Shapowloff     NSWLR   at       ACLR    The defence requires an actual expectation that the company was and would

cannot hide behind ignorance of the company s affairs which is of their own making or  if not entirely of their own making  has been contributed to by their own failure to make further necessary inquiries  Statewide Tobacco Services Ltd v Morley     ACSR     Morley v Statewide Tobacco Services Ltd     VR         ACSR           This passage was approved by Palmer J in Hall v Poolman  supra  at    However  as I have noted earlier  par   above  whether a realisation of the stock or other assets can be taken into account has a temporal aspect or limitation to it  I adopt the observation of Palmer J in Hall v Poolman  supra  at par    see par   above   Whether Mr Carroll had the relevant expectation depends upon the facts and circumstances known to him at the time  or throughout the period  he had that expectation  Whether Mr Carroll had reasonable grounds to expect  and did expect  that the Company was solvent throughout the relevant period and would remain solvent even if it incurred the debts during that period requires a staged inquiry  It was explained by Palmer J in Hall v Poolman  supra  at         There comes a point where the reasonable director must inform himself or herself as fully as possible of all relevant facts and then ask himself or herself and the other directors   How sure are we that this asset can be turned into cash to pay all our debts  present and to be incurred  within   months  Is that outcome certain  probable  more likely than not  possible  possible with a bit of luck  possible with a lot of luck  remote  or is there is no real way of knowing            If the honest and reasonable answer is  certain  or  probable  the director can have a reasonable expectation of solvency            If the honest and reasonable answer is anywhere from  possible  to  no way of knowing  the director can have no reasonable expectation of solvency            If the honest and reasonable answer is  more likely than not  the director runs the risk that a court will hold to the contrary in an insolvent trading claim            If the honest and reasonable answer is  no way of knowing yet  we need more information  the director must then ask  How long before we have the information so that we can give a final answer            If the honest and reasonable answer to that question is   By a definite date which will not extend the realisation period  if there is to be one  beyond   months  the director may reasonably say   Let s wait until then before deciding             If the honest and reasonable answer is  there is no way of knowing yet when we will have the information to make a decision  the director must say   Then there is no way that we can now have a reasonable expectation of solvency and there is no way we can reasonably justify continuing to trade without knowing when we will know whether the company is insolvent  Call the administrators   By this series of questions and answers I do not mean to lay down some pro forma test of directors  liability for insolvent trading  Each case depends on its particular facts  These questions and answers merely serve to illustrate that when a company is struggling to pay its debts  the directors must face up to the issue of insolvent trading directly and with brutal honesty  they must not shirk from asking themselves the hard questions and from acting resolutely in accordance with the honest answers to those questions  Mr Carroll advanced a number of grounds which he submitted were reasonable and which founded his expectation of solvency  Those grounds must be considered against the background that Mr Carroll knew throughout the relevant period that the Company was not in fact paying its debts as and when they fell due  I consider that whether Mr Carroll had reasonable grounds to expect that the Company was solvent during the relevant period depends substantially upon his reliance on the Company s inventory of stock and his reliance on communications with Mr Bright  Sections  S and   are applicable to an insolvent trading claim such as has been brought in the present proceeding  Hall v Poolman  supra  at    Although there has been a debate as to whether s   applies to an insolvent trading case in addition to s  S  it does not matter whether one or other or both sections apply as the Court is required to have regard to the same considerations in each section  I am satisfied that throughout the whole of the relevant period and  indeed  at all material times prior to   December   Mr Carroll acted honestly  The plaintiffs did not submit to the contrary  In reaching this conclusion I have adopted the criteria for determining such honesty set out by Palmer J in Hall v Poolman  supra  at     in the following terms        In my view  when considering whether a person has acted honestly for the purposes of a defence under ss  S b i  or   of the CA  the court should be concerned only with the question whether the person has acted honestly in the ordinary meaning of that term  that is  whether the person has acted without deceit or conscious impropriety  without intent to gain improper benefit or advantage for himself  herself or for another  and without carelessness or imprudence to such a degree as to demonstrate that no genuine attempt at all has been to carry out the duties and obligations of his or her office imposed by the Corporations Act or the general law  A failure to consider the interests of the company as a whole  or more particularly the interests of creditors  may be of such a high degree as to demonstrate failure to act honestly in this sense  However  if failure to consider the interests of the company as a whole  including the interests of its creditors  does not rise to such a high degree but is the result of error of judgment  no finding of failure to act honestly should be made  but the failure must be taken into account as one of the circumstances of the case to which the court must have regard under ss  S b ii  and   of the CA  Having regard to all the circumstances of the case ought Mr Carroll fairly to be excused  Mr Carroll submitted that he should be excused in circumstances where he continued to take advice from Mr Bright and acted upon it  It was submitted that his approach to the Company s problems up to   May   was that to be expected of a reasonable  commercially experienced director dealing with ongoing issues in a company which was suffering cashflow problems by reason of one of the Company s two businesses experiencing  cash burn   It was submitted that he sought and obtained advice from Mr Bright  an expert accountant experienced in the timber industry and that he did not ignore or downplay that advice  but acted upon it appropriately  The difficulty with this submission is that from September   until   May   the Company continued to have problems with the drying of the timber and the use of the kilns which it could not resolve  This had the consequence of creating what Mr Carroll called the  cash burn  which continued until   May    It is not in doubt that throughout the relevant period Mr Carroll was faced with difficult decisions  To adopt and adapt the words of Hamlet  to trade or not to trade  that is the question   As I noted in par   above  Mr Carroll regularly during the relevant period asked the question whether the Company was insolvent or close to the line of being insolvent and on a number of occasions Mr Bright answered the question in the negative  That dilemma facing Mr Carroll brings to mind the observation of Palmer J in Hall v Poolman  supra  at         As I have discussed above at   and following  it is sometimes a difficult decision for a director of a trading corporation suffering from liquidity problems to decide whether  and when  to abandon hope of a change in the company s fortunes and to summon the administrators  There are often pressing interests involved in the decision  the jobs of employees will be lost  the investment of shareholders will evaporate  and a promising venture in which a great deal of personal effort may have been expended will end in failure  On the other hand  the livelihood of creditors whose businesses depend on reasonably prompt payment may also be ruined if a company continues to trade while insolvent  When confronted with the necessity of making a decision involving these factors  a director cannot afford to procrastinate or to avoid confronting realities  He or she must ask and honestly answer the hard questions  see   and following above        When finally confronted with the ultimatum from the Australian Taxation Office on   May   Mr Carroll did not procrastinate  On the next day he spoke to Mr Bright who put him in contact with Mr McLellan and Mr Carroll met Mr McLellan three days later  The plaintiffs submitted that the fact that Mr Carroll persisted with the kiln drying business which involved cash burn and thereby permitted the Company to incur debts knowing that it could not meet those debts out of cashflow ought to preclude relief under ss  S or   as he had been aware  for no less than eighteen months previously  of compelling factors pointing to the Company s insolvency  I have taken that submission into account and weighed it in the balance in having regard to all the circumstances of the case  However it is an exaggeration to say that there were compelling factors pointing to the Company s insolvency for no less than eighteen months prior to   May    The potential insolvency facing the Company in June   had been arrested in July   by the capital contributions made by Mr Carroll and Mr Cameron  The spectre of insolvency did not re emerge until the end of   less than five months before   May    There is no doubt that Mr Carroll permitted the Company to incur debts in circumstances giving rise to a contravention of s  G of the Act  However  he did so against the background of all the circumstances to which I have referred in pars     above  Mr Carroll did not profit personally from permitting the Company to trade in this way throughout the relevant period  He was not disregarding advice and  indeed  obtained advice from Mr Bright and others throughout the relevant period followedSouthern Cross Interiors Pty Ltd  in liq  v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation     ALR  Mr Carroll relied upon a number of matters in support of his submission that the Company was not insolvent as at   December   or thereafter during the relevant period  However  when considering these matters it is important to bear in mind  as referred to earlier in par   that the issue of solvency is a question of fact to be determined from an analysis of the Company s financial position taken as a whole  having regard to  commercial realities   A particular  commercial reality  is the extent to which a company s assets can be realised or made available as a security to raise money and the time it would take to do so  In this respect the observation of Palmer J in Southern Cross Interiors Pty Ltd  in liq  v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   NSWSC         ALR   at par   is relevant       In considering the company s financial position as a whole  the Court must have regard to commercial realities  Commercial realities will be relevant in considering what resources are available to the company to meet its liabilities as they fall due  whether resources other than cash are realisable by sale or borrowing upon security  and when such realisations are achievable  followedLewis v Doran   NSWSC         ACSR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  htmlI adopt  with respect  the observation of Palmer J in Lewis v Doran   NSWSC         ACSR   at           Where the question is retrospective insolvency  the court has the inestimable benefit of the wisdom of hindsight  One can see the whole picture  both before  as at and after the alleged date of insolvency  The court will be able to see whether as at the alleged date of insolvency the company was  or was not actually paying all of its debts as they fell due and whether it did  or did not  actually pay all those debts which  although not due as at the alleged date of insolvency  nevertheless became due at a time which  as a matter of commercial reality and common sense  had to be considered as at the date of insolvency  By reference to what actually happened  rather than to conflicting experts  opinions as to the implications of balance sheets  the court s task in assessing insolvency as at the alleged date should not be very difficult  followedPowell v Fryer   SASC         FLR  http www austlii edu au au cases sa SASC  htmlThe next issue to determine is whether at the time the Company was insolvent there were reasonable grounds for suspecting that the Company was insolvent or would so become insolvent as the case may be  s  G c   The test prescribed by s  G c  is an objective test  Powell v Fryer   SASC         FLR     Hall v Poolman  supra  at    The concept of  suspecting  or  suspicion  involves having a state of mind which falls between having a firm belief or a significant degree of satisfaction that insolvency exists on the one hand and wondering whether it exists on the other  The concept of having a  suspicion  requires an affirmative feeling  Hall v Poolman  supra  at   followedTourprint International Pty Ltd v Bott     ACSR  The distinction was explained succinctly in Tourprint International Pty Ltd v Bott     ACSR   at          Expectation  as required by s  H  means a higher degree of certainty than  mere hope or possibility  or  suspecting   M Australia Pty Ltd v Kemish     ACLR   at   Dunn v Shapowloff     NSWLR   at       ACLR    The defence requires an actual expectation that the company was and would continue to be solvent  and that the grounds for so expecting are reasonable  A director cannot rely on a complete ignorance of or neglect of duty   Metal Manufacturers Ltd v Lewis     ACLR   at   and cannot hide behind ignorance of the company s affairs which is of their own making or  if not entirely of their own making  has been contributed to by their own failure to make further necessary inquiries  Statewide Tobacco Services Ltd v Morley     ACSR     Morley v Statewide Tobacco Services Ltd     VR         ACSR           This passage was approved by Palmer J in Hall v Poolman  supra  at   citedManpac Industries Pty Ltd v Ceccattini   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  htmlAn analysis of the defence available under s  H a  which is helpful in the present context  was undertaken by Young CJ in Manpac Industries Pty Ltd v Ceccattini     ACLC       NSWSC    Young CJ said at pars           It is extremely difficult for a person to say that a person is responsible for providing adequate information about solvency and was fulfilling that responsibility when the person allegedly relying on the other person was the source of the supply of information and that supply of information was not completely full            The subsection arises from the recommendations made in para   of the Law Reform Commission s Discussion Paper No   as fleshed out in   and following of the Harmer Report  In   it was said               The Commission considers that the defence is clearly necessary in the case of larger companies in which it cannot be expected that directors will have control over every action taken in the conduct of the company s business  Additionally  a defence of this nature may encourage a proper system of financial management                 Thus the prime thrust of the defence is to cover the situation where there is a large corporation with bulky accounts and where there is a system in place of competent accountants  credit controllers and financial management and the board has a regime whereby those people  provided they are competent and responsible  will report to the board any problems that the board may pick up  The prime thrust of the exception is not to deal with the situation where a small company with directors who have little idea of accountancy  bring in a trouble shooter  supply the trouble shooter with information which may not be complete  receive reports back from the trouble shooter and then intend to rely on a report which is incomplete because they have provided incomplete information  There is no doubt that Mr Bright was engaged or retained by the Company in March   for the purpose of giving the Company business advice regarding the Company s cashflows  costs and expenses  and an analysis of the business model profits and losses  Mr Bright prepared financial statements which included requiring him to allocate a value to the timber stock inventory  Further  in the middle of   he prepared financial analyses relating to the green timber milling business which he considered to be still profitable  However  I do not consider that Mr Bright was given the role of  the other person  for the purposes of s  H a i  of the Act  That is to say  I do not consider that Mr Bright was required to fulfil the role or did fulfil the role of a competent and reliable person who was responsible for providing to Mr Carroll adequate information about whether the Company was solvent  Certainly Mr Bright was a competent and reliable person but I do not consider that it can be said that he was  responsible  for providing to Mr Carroll adequate information about whether the Company was solvent  True it is that on occasions he gave Mr Carroll advice about whether the Company was solvent  He gave such advice in or about June   and later during the relevant period  although his evidence as to what he told Mr Carroll in relation to the solvency of the Company during the relevant period was limited  His evidence was       I was aware by March   as Tony had told me  that TSM s cashflow situation was poor  and that the funds provided by Tom Cameron and Tony to TSM in July   had been exhausted  in February    At this time  Tony was looking for potential investors  which he discussed with me  At no time during January to April   did I formally tell Tony that I believed TSM was insolvent  Based on the value of its stock at hand  which I considered was saleable and able to be realised within a short period of time  i e  a couple of months  I did not consider that TSM was insolvent at that time  and I told Tony this on a number of occasions
