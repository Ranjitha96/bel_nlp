signed by the Bowens personally  There is no evidence to suggest that any of the companies involved in these cases included external shareholders or carried on any separate businesses that could not

the Full Court in Quinlivan v Australian Competition and Consumer Competition   FCAFC   there were unsettled questions concerning the interrelationship between s  A and s  B of the Act  Despite submissions to the contrary by counsel for the ACCC  in my opinion that decision settled those questions for the purposes of a single judge  with one possible qualification  The reasoning of the Full Court appears as follows  at        From the interaction of these provisions three conclusions emerge  First  s  A does not detract from the Yorke principle that actual knowledge of the essential elements of the contravention is required if s  B or s   is to apply  Where the contravening conduct involves misrepresentation  whether as to a future matter or not  this principle requires actual knowledge by the accessorial respondent of the falsity of the representation  This is an essential matter which must be alleged and proved  Su v Direct Flights International Pty Ltd   FCA   at     Fernandez v Glev Pty Ltd   FCA   at       Secondly  the reversal of onus in s  A  does not apply where the accessorial liability of s  B or s   is relied on          Thirdly  it is implicit in s  A  that where a corporation does have reasonable grounds for making a representation with respect to a future matter then there will be no contravention of s            Accordingly  where s  B or s   accessorial liability is in issue in relation to a representation with respect to a future matter  the existence or otherwise of reasonable grounds will be relevant  If reasonable grounds exist  there will have been no contravention and thus no question of accessorial liability will arise  However  as against the accessorial respondent  the onus will be on the applicant to show the respondent had actual knowledge that       the representation was made and     it was misleading or     the corporation had no reasonable grounds for making it      See Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Michigan Group Pty Ltd   FCA   at      The qualification is that in a case such as the present  where the corporations are parties  there is an argument available that the liability of the corporation should be decided in accordance with s  A for all purposes including assessment of accessorial liability followedRural Press Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCAFC
