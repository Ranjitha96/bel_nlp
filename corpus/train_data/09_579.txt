Cth   the Act  for a determination of the compensation payable under the Act in respect of acts which are said to have either extinguished or significantly impaired or otherwise affected the native

Schedule A are the leading members of the Baru  Yoren and Charlie families  Each of the indigenous respondents other than Brian Cobus is a member of Walmbaar  On   February   Beaumont J made a further order in the Hopevale determination proceeding directing  by Order   that Walmbaar  is the prescribed body corporate which  after becoming a registered native title body corporate  will perform the functions mentioned in s   of the Native Title Act   for the Dingaal Clan   The reason for the long delay between that order and the Hopevale determination of   December   is not clear  Differences of opinion emerged between Gordon Charlie and others on the one hand and members of the Baru and Yoren families on the other as to whether the Dingaal People comprise descent members of the Baru and Yoren families notwithstanding the definitional matters contained in the Rules of Walmbaar   Interpretation   For example  a notice convening a meeting for   June   of  all Dingaalwarra and Biddi Baru members  to be held at  Gungarde Office  in Cooktown was issued to Walmbaar members signed by Gordon Charlie at which meeting a resolution was to be proposed that Phillip Baru  Elaine McGreen and all Baru and Yoren members be expelled from Walmbaar and that  all Yoren and Baru descent members who are members of  Walmbaar  resign  their membership  as they belong to another clan and are not Dingaal clan descendents   The notice contained a pro forma notice of resignation and a commentary that Baru and Yoren family members are members of a separate clan called the Biddi Baru clan  The meeting did not take place  Neither Phillip Baru nor Elaine McGreen nor any member of the Baru and Yoren families resigned their membership of Walmbaar  Consistent with the notion that Baru and Yoren family members form part of a different clan  steps were taken in   to incorporate under the ACA Act a corporation described as Biddi Baru Aboriginal Corporation which by rule   of its Rules defines native title holders in respect of relevant land as members of the Baru and Yoren families from the Cape Flattery area  Mr Testro  a legal officer employed by the Land Council  deposes in his affidavit that members of the Baru and Yoren families did not establish the Biddi Baru Corporation  they continue to assert membership of Walmbaar on the footing that they are members of the Dingaal clan as recited in the Rules of Walmbaar  and they are seeking to establish who caused the new corporation to be formed on that footing citedDingaal Tribe v State of Queensland and Ors   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe position adopted in the notice signed by Gordon Charlie was consistent with Gordon Charlie s contentions before Cooper J in   in Dingaal Tribe v State of Queensland and Ors   FCA   that  under the traditional law and customs of the Dingaal people  he is the only person entitled  and thereby authorised  to make the claim for native title on behalf of the claim group   at    In that proceeding  QG  of   Gordon Charlie and Jonathon Charlie as joint applicants sought a native title determination in respect of particular lands and waters on behalf of the Dingaal tribe  Gary Yoren  Ned Yoren  Elaine Baru and Louis Charlie applied pursuant to s  B of the Act for an order that Yoren  Yoren and Baru replace Gordon Charlie and Jonathon Charlie as applicants on the footing that resolutions passed at a meeting at Hopevale on   April   removed the authority of the existing applicants to maintain the claim on behalf of the claimant group  Cooper J found that notice of meeting had been given directly or indirectly to all members of the Dingaal claim group and that there was no traditional law or custom binding on the claim group preventing them from terminating the authority of Gordon Charlie and Jonathon Charlie  at   and    Cooper J concluded that the authority of Gordon Charlie and Jonathon Charlie to continue to act as applicants had been withdrawn by resolution of the meeting of the Dingaal clan and accordingly orders were made replacing Gordon Charlie and Jonathon Charlie with Gary Yoren  Ned Yoren and Elaine Baru citedGordon Charlie v Cape York Land Council   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlProceeding QG  of   was a claim by the Dingaal People of native title rights and a claim of connection with Lizard Island and the islands offshore from Cape Flattery  and associated waters   On   February   Dingaal clan members convened at the Church Hall in Hopevale to consider a presentation in relation to the claim by the National Native Title Tribunal  a report and presentation by a consultant anthropologist  Dr Fiona Powell  and a presentation on future tasks to be undertaken by the Land Council  The claim group members unanimously resolved to amend the claim to include other claimant groups asserting rights in relation to the land and waters  namely  the Thanil  Nguuruumungu  Gulaal  Ngaatha and Thittaar Peoples  That resolution made necessary an amendment to the application so as to alter the area of land and waters the subject of the claim and the composition of the claim groups  The Land Council sought to convene a meeting of Dingaal members on   October   at    am at Hopevale to authorise amendments to the native title application  Gordon Charlie sought to restrain the conduct of the meeting that morning on the footing that the Charlie family incorporates a sub group family described as the Brim family and members of that family had not been invited to the meeting nor incorporated within the claim  The Brim family members were said to be in tension with the Baru and Yoren families  Gordon Charlie was unsuccessful in his application for an injunction   Gordon Charlie v Cape York Land Council   FCA    The meeting did not proceed on   October   due to the death of Mr Gary Yoren  an applicant member of the Dingaal claim group  The authorisation meeting was reconvened for   November   and   November   at Hopevale  Gordon Charlie sought to restrain the meeting on the morning of   November    He did so based on the contention that the Baru and Yoren People are not part of the Dingaal clan  He contended that Brim family members are part of the Dingaal clan through Charlie family members and therefore seven identified members of the Brim family and some family members associated with some of those individuals  ought to have been invited to the meeting  Gordon Charlie contended that Brim family members ought to be joined in the claim  they derive their rights through identified Charlie clan members  and Baru and Yoren families are not members of the Dingaal clan  In that proceeding  Dr Fiona Powell swore an affidavit concerning her extensive anthropological research in relation to the Dingaal claim  Dr Powell said that she had revealed no evidence which suggested a connection between the Charlie family and the Brim family or connections on the part of the Brim family to the area claimed in the Dingaal application  Dr Powell identified the foundation for that view citedGordon Charlie v Cape York Land Council  No      FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe relevance of that proceeding for present purposes is simply that Gordon Charlie continued to assert a different composition of or foundation for the Dingaal clan notwithstanding the Hopevale determination and the terms recited in the Rules of Walmbaar adopted by Gordon Charlie and other Charlie family members  First  the Dingaal clan was said to properly embrace the Brim family and secondly  the Baru and Yoren families were said not to be part of the Dingaal clan  Gordon Charlie was unsuccessful in the injunction application   Gordon Charlie v Cape York Land Council  No      FCA    In that proceeding  Gordon Charlie contended that a meeting of Dingaal native title clan members and some non members took place at Cooktown at the  Lions Park  on   July    The meeting was said to have passed a number of resolutions including a resolution that only Charlie family members have standing to maintain a Dingaal clan native title claim  The minutes of the contended meeting record the attendance of Vernon Yoren  Henry Baru  Elaine Baru  Phyllis Greenway  nee Baru  and Kevin Yoren  However  the evidence of a Hopevale Lutheran Minister  Reverend Jantke  who presided at the relevant burial services and who had possession of Lutheran Church records  demonstrated that all of those individuals had died well before   July   which caused the Court to conclude that the minutes of the meeting and contentions in relation to the meeting were unreliable  That evidence  of course  was relevant only for the purposes of the proceeding in question  However  the fact of that controversy in that proceeding remains a relevant historical fact in explaining the subsequent chronology of events by which the resolution of the intra indigenous issues concerning the composition of the Dingaal clan were sought to be resolved citedDPP v Webb   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  htmlA decision to institute a proceeding to seek and obtain a compensation determination in relation to those matters identified particularly at Schedules E  I and J of the application  under the provisions of the Act  and the analysis in that proceeding of the amount of compensation by reference to just terms or the similar compensable interest test in respect of acts said to have either extinguished or significantly impaired or otherwise affected the native title rights and interests of the Dingaal People as determined by the Court on   December   is a decision  regarding  native title  The scope of an application under s   can be seen in the criteria to be applied under s   for determining compensation  Section   provides that subject to subsection   the entitlement to compensation under Division    A   B    or   is an entitlement on just terms to compensate the native title holders for any loss  diminution  impairment or other effect of the act on their native title rights and interests   A decision to commence a proceeding for compensation and engage  on behalf of the native title holders  an analytical process which seeks to identify any loss  diminution  impairment or other effect of an act on their native title rights and interests is necessarily a decision regarding native title for the purposes of Rule    The use of the word  regarding  in the context of the Rules and the functions to be performed by Walmbaar is necessarily a word of wide application  It is intended to have a wide application  in its context   DPP v Webb   NSWSC   at   to  per O Keefe J   There is no sound basis for importing the definition of  native title decision  in Regulation   of the NT  PB  Regulations into the construction of the Rules of Walmbaar either directly or analogically  The scope and operation of Regulation   is discussed shortly  Accordingly  the decision to institute a compensation application ought to have been made in accordance with the decision making requirements of Rule   of Walmbaar s Rules  The decision to commence proceedings was taken by the Committee of Walmbaar on   July    There is simply no evidence of whether the common law members were given notice of the proposed decision  or of whether they expressed views about it or were engaged by the Committee in any formal or informal consultation process  The Committee members are not identified  Neither Gordon Charlie nor Ruth Schaefer filed any affidavit on the motion notwithstanding that each of them might have spoken directly to the events in issue  No minutes of the meeting are produced  Walmbaar has changed its position by  in effect  abandoning Gordon Charlie s original contention that the decision to commence the proceeding was the subject of a resolution of   of the common law holders obtained at a meeting on   July    That position that was relied upon not only by Gordon Charlie in his affidavit sworn on   November   but also by him on   February   by reason of Mr Black s letter of that date asserting reliance on the resolution  Walmbaar contends in submissions that there are two decisions which confer authority to institute the application  The first is the resolution at the meeting on   July   and the second is the decision of the Committee made on   July    Walmbaar says that the only evidence concerning a vote by common law holders is the evidence of Gordon Charlie contained in his affidavit of   November    However  the primary contentions of Walmbaar which are recited in Mr Black s letter  rather than the subject of an affidavit by Gordon Charlie as to the facts  place reliance upon the authority of the Committee and the decision it took on   July    The Committee cannot act independently of the decision making process contained in Rule    Rules   and   of Walmbaar s Rules which set out the objects taken in conjunction with Rule   which sets out the powers of the Committee  do not confer power upon the Committee to make decisions regarding native title without complying with Rule   citedJango and Ors v Northern Territory and Ors   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn addition  the claim as framed goes beyond the land and waters
