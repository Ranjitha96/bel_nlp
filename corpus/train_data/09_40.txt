particular activities but the directors and management disregard those activities and direct the company into different commercial areas  In the course of final submissions Senior Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the Council ought to be condemned for its failure to meet the expectations of its members  However  s   is not a punitive provision but rather a remedial provision  Re Spargos Mining NL  supra  at    The remedy to be granted under ss   and   is not to punish or to condemn but rather to remedy and end such oppression as has existed or such conduct which has arisen  Senior Counsel for the plaintiff explained the concerns of the plaintiff in response to a question I put to him when he drew my attention to the fact that in the audited financial statements for the year ended   June   there was a significant variation in the figure shown as the surplus between the draft financial statements and the final financial statements  The Income Statement in the draft financial statements showed a net surplus for the period ended   June   of   whereas the Income Statement in the final financial statements showed a net surplus of   for the same period  I asked Counsel how he put the variation on the issue of oppression  Counsel responded     Your Honour  it doesn t constitute oppression in itself  the clause starting with the financial records  but it s consistent with a company that s not paying attention to its objectives and its data  which is included to have good governance and financial controls  We say it s consistent with an organisation that simply isn t effectively pursuing its objectives and properly conducting its affairs  But in itself  it doesn t constitute oppression and as it doesn t disclose insolvency it isn t a ground we rely upon for winding up  We don t pursue winding up  But  your Honour  it s also consistent with a course of conduct with not providing documents which ought to have been provided  When they re requested they re still not provided  let alone within a reasonable time      So  it s consistent with the other complaints we make and supportive of the proposition that confronted with the failure to properly conduct the company and pursue its objects and involve members in the way that had been contemplated and then failure to disclose financial information to establish the basis upon which it could fund the activities it was supposed to pursue or any budget for the business plans that had been produced  Mr Szental was really left     He either walked away  saying well it doesn t matter that this company is not being conducted properly  it doesn t matter that it s not pursuing its objectives  it doesn t matter that the demand side policies aren t being developed and advocated      It doesn t matter that there s a process by which there is a selection of representatives not based on any procedure or structure to participate in briefings and advocacy  He could do that  that would be an easy thing to do  Or he could do it really as the only effective form of proceeding that he could bring  which is this proceeding  to attempt to remedy those deficiencies  which is what he s done      Mr Szental s concerns were understandable but they do not warrant a finding of oppression  Further  by the commencement of the final hearing the substantive matters complained of by the plaintiff had been attended to by the Council  That consequence gives rise to the question as to whether it is open to a court to grant relief under s   when the conduct complained of  although in existence at the time the proceeding was filed  is no longer continuing as at the date of the trial or thereafter consideredShelton v NRMA Limited     ACSR  The  contrary to the interests  provision now contained in

at     See also Re Spargos Mining NL     ACSR   at   Shelton v NRMA Limited     ACSR     An example of such conduct may be found where a company is formed for the purpose of undertaking particular activities but the directors and management disregard those activities and direct the company into different commercial areas  An essential feature of the  oppression  provisions in subpar  e  of s   is whether or not there has been commercial unfairness  The manner in which the Court should approach the issue whether there has been commercial unfairness was conveniently identified by Tamberlin J in Shelton v NRMA Limited  supra  as follows at        It is not practicable to delineate the numerous ways in which oppressive conduct may be established  The court will generally look at the overall course of conduct and consider whether it is so unfair that reasonable directors would not consider it fair  If directors exercise a power so as to impose a disability or burden on a member that is unfair according to ordinary standards of reasonableness and fair dealing  then such conduct may be described as oppressive  The question is one of fact and degree for the Court to determine  having regard to the view the directors have formed themselves  and allowing for any special skill or knowledge possessed by the directors  The test of unfairness is objective  see Wayde v NSW Rugby League Limited   HCA         CLR   at     Wayde   per Brennan J  Morgan v   Flers Avenue Pty Ltd     NSWLR    The court should not take a narrow approach to cases of oppression  It is necessary for the court to come to a conclusion that there has been conduct unfairly prejudicial to or unfairly discriminatory or oppressive to a member before it makes an order to this effect  see John J Starr  Real Estate  Pty Ltd v Andrew  Australasia  Pty Limited     ACSR     and the authorities there collected at      citedTurnbull v NRMA Limited   NSWSC         ACSR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct

Spargos Mining NL     ACSR   at   Shelton v NRMA Limited     ACSR     An example of such conduct may be found where a company is formed for the purpose of undertaking particular activities but the directors and management disregard those activities and direct the company into different commercial areas  The proposition that the purpose of granting a remedy under ss   and   is to bring to an end the conduct or oppression of which complaint is made was explained by Giles JA in Campbell v BackOffice Investments Pty Ltd  supra  at        The predecessors to ss   and   were introduced in the United Kingdom as s   of the Companies Act    UK  as a means of giving an aggrieved shareholder a remedy when winding up on the just and equitable ground would be too harsh  They enabled orders by which the oppression came to an end with the shareholder remaining a shareholder  as in Re H R Harmer Ltd     All ER       WLR   or came to an end through the shareholder being brought out as a shareholder  as in Scottish Cooperative Wholesale Society Ltd v Meyer   AC         All ER     Scottish Cooperative    That legislation was adopted in Australia  and has since been significantly amended to the form earlier set out  There are more widely available statutory remedies  but historically the point of granting a remedy is to bring an end to the oppression as Powell J said in Re Dernacourt Investments Pty Ltd     NSWLR   at     ACSR   at    if it be possible  to bring the  oppression  to an end without recourse to a cure the effects of which would  in many cases  be worse than the disease       See also per Basten JA at   Young CJ in Eq at    Given that the purpose of granting a remedy under ss   and   is to bring to an end the conduct complained of  what is the situation if that conduct  in existence at or prior to the commencement of the proceeding  has terminated by the time of trial The general trend of authority is that it is open to a court to grant relief under s   of the Act notwithstanding the fact that at the time of the trial or the making of an order the conduct or oppression complained of is not continuing  A considerable number of authorities in this context were considered by the members of the Court in Campbell v BackOffice Investments Pty Ltd  supra   I consider that the appropriate approach to take is that expressed by Giles JA in Campbell v BackOffice Investments Pty Ltd  supra  at      In my opinion  it is not necessary that the conduct complained of be continuing at the time the court considers making an order  Rather  claimed relief founded on conduct which is no longer continuing may be refused  but will not always be refused  in the exercise of the discretion  and the discretion adequately allows for the logicality to which Hamilton J referred  in Bessounian v Australian Wholesale Mortgages Pty Ltd   NSWSC      citedGamlestaden Fastigheter AB v Baltic Partners Ltd     All ER  Basten JA relied on the decision of the Privy Council in Gamlestaden Fastigheter AB v Baltic Partners Ltd     All ER   as authority for the proposition that  neither the occasion nor the purpose of an order under s   need involve continuing oppressive conduct   at    However  Young CJ in Eq took the view  at   that  the authorities still require one to show continuing oppression at the date of hearing unless one is complaining about an act in the past of a director or other controller of the company which has a continuing effect   As the Council had attended to the substantive matters complained of by the plaintiff by the commencement of the final hearing  there is no conduct which needs to be the subject of an order or relief to operate prospectively  In any event  I do not consider that the relief sought by the plaintiff is an appropriate form of relief either in the circumstances of this case or for the purposes of satisfying s   of the Act  The relief sought by the plaintiff is that an independent person from one of the major four accounting firms be appointed to prepare a report to the members of the Council as to the Council s compliance with its obligations under the Memorandum of Understanding and the Information Memorandum  as to the adequacy of the Council s financial records and its solvency  and as to the extent and adequacy of the policies  mechanisms and procedures of the Council concerning corporate governance  reporting to the board and financial record keeping  budgeting  forecasting and reporting  Further  the plaintiff seeks that the independent person provide recommendations as to what changes should be made to such policies  mechanisms and procedures  There are a number of criticisms or objections to this form of order of relief  Such relief leads nowhere  It does not resolve or remove the conduct complained of by the plaintiff or the acts upon which it relies for the purpose of complaining about the conduct of the Council s affairs  The matters upon which the independent person is required to report are not solely accounting or financial matters and extend beyond his or her probable expertise and experience  In particular  compliance with the Council s obligations under the Memorandum of Understanding and the Information Memorandum are not matters appropriate for determination by an accountant citedWilliams v Spautz   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe Council then submitted that in seeking an order that will not remove oppression the plaintiff had commenced and continued the proceeding as a means of obtaining some advantage for which the proceeding was not designed or some collateral advantage beyond what the law offered  Williams v Spautz   HCA         CLR   at      The Council contended that the plaintiff s true purpose in bringing the proceeding was to obtain findings from the court for potential distribution to members of the Council  The Council relied on the following passages in Mr Szental s cross examination     But isn t your position in this litigation that you want the court to order an independent report to be provided to the members and then you want the members in some fashion to consider that report    I think an independent report from the court or the court findings would carry different weight to the proposition that you ve been putting  which is basically that I am a sole dissenting member of the board  and I think that it would carry an independence and a weight that possibly I could never muster  It would also           Though really it is sorry    And it would make findings that there are actual deficiencies      So really is the object of this exercise to get court findings rather than an independent report     The object of this exercise is to bring to the attention of the members that the management of the industry association up till now has been far from adequate and not in their best interests  I mean I have nothing to gain out of this other than to try and improve the benefits  I led three quarters of the members through the BCSE into this merger and I have an obligation to them and I m trying to fulfil that obligation by trying to inform them that what they signed on for isn t what they got  I do not accept the Council s submission  The plaintiff has brought the proceeding in order to have the manner of the conduct of the Council s affairs changed  It seeks to achieve this result by seeking certain relief a report by an independent accountant to the members of the Council in relation to particular aspects of the conduct of the Council s affairs  For reasons to which I shall refer  I do not consider that that form of relief is appropriate in the circumstances of this case or that it will achieve a result of the type contemplated by ss   and    But that conclusion does not mean the plaintiff has been motivated by an improper purpose in commencing the proceeding  Its purpose in bringing the proceeding is to end a course of conduct  Accepting Mr Szental s evidence that the plaintiff commenced the proceeding to obtain findings by the Court which it could distribute to members does not mean an abuse of process  Rather  it means that the means by which the plaintiff is seeking to achieve its purpose is misguided and inappropriate  The discretion committed to the Court by s   is very wide and unconstrained  In an appropriate case  a particular type of conduct of the affairs of a company might be eliminated or terminated by directing a particular person to report on particular aspects of the conduct of a company s affairs to its members or by a Court making particular findings as to the manner in which the company s affairs have been conducted citedFexuto Pty Ltd v Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd   NSWSC         ACSR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  htmlThe plaintiff may be misconceived as to whether the relief it seeks will end the conduct or oppression of which it complains  That misconception does not mean that it is seeking an improper collateral advantage in bringing the proceeding  The advantage sought by the plaintiff in the proceeding is to terminate the manner in which the Council s affairs have been conducted in a number of respects  Section   gives the plaintiff the opportunity to seek relief within the range of relief provided in s   of the Act  The appropriate relief to grant in any given case is a matter for the Court and the court must tailor that relief so as bring to an end the impugned conduct  Fexuto Pty Ltd v Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd   NSWSC         ACSR        As I noted in par   above  I do not propose to make specific findings in relation to the numerous complaints made by the plaintiff  A number of the issues raised by the plaintiff were acknowledged by the Council with the addendum that they had been rectified and remedied by the time the proceeding commenced  I have referred to some of these issues in par   above  The power to grant relief under s   is very wide and the specific types of orders set out in s   are inclusive rather than exclusive  However  in considering what remedies should be made available to a party seeking relief under ss   and   it is necessary to consider the appropriateness of the remedy as at the time of the trial  and not simply at the time the application to the Court for relief was filed  Notwithstanding the width of the discretion in s   as to the relief which may be granted  the relief to be granted should be such as to terminate or remove the oppressive conduct or the conduct which is contrary to the interests of the members of the company  As Young J put it in Fexuto Pty Ltd v Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd   NSWSC         ACSR   at      The flavour of the section also is that the court is only to give the remedy which removes the oppression  Note the remedy in fact given in Re H R Harmer Ltd     WLR   at    Thus it is not enough merely to find oppression and then proceed to find some remedy that might bring peace to the company generally  The court should only grant the remedy that removes the oppression found
