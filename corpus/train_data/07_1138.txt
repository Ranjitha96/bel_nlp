Inco Ships Pty Ltd v Finlay Murdoch Hardman   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredComcare v Fiedler   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The applicant justifies the raising of those issues for the first time on appeal on the basis of an asserted obligation of the Tribunal to inquire into and correctly consider questions of law arising on the matter before it  even in the face of concessions or admissions by the parties  It relies upon Comcare v Fiedler   FCA         FCR   at     for that proposition   I do not consider that that decision supports its contention  That case relevantly concerned the question of whether the Tribunal had erred in failing to address the question under s  c  of the Safety  Rehabilitation and Compensation Act    Cth  of whether the employee claiming compensation had undertaken all reasonable rehabilitative treatment for the impairment which was compensable  That consideration was relevant to whether the injury had resulted in permanent impairment  so as to entitle the employee concerned to a lump sum compensation payment  The Full Court  Drummond  Kiefel and Dowsett JJ  at   said    The Tribunal is not  as a general rule  required to ignore the fact that one or both parties have made admissions or concessions  express or implied  that particular issues which the original decision maker may have had to consider need not be the subject of inquiry and determination by the Tribunal  The Tribunal will  however  fall into error of law by failing to inquire of its own motion into  and make a finding on  an issue the subject of an admission or concession by a party that is material to its decision if there is reason to doubt that the admission or concession is factually justified  But in the absence of there being some reason to question the admission or concession  the Tribunal will generally be entitled not to inquire into the issue for itself  but to act on that admission or concession in making its decision   In my judgment  the conduct of the matter before the Tribunal clearly indicates that  at least impliedly  the applicant did not seek to ventilate the issues arising under ss   or   of the Act  and restricted itself to the matters which the Tribunal identified  The Tribunal in those circumstances was quite entitled to proceed upon the basis that those matters were not contentious  It did not err in failing to address them  Consequently  the applicant is not now entitled to assert or cannot succeed in asserting that the Tribunal erred in law by failing to do so citedCoulton v Holcombe   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In addition  there are a few matters in respect of which it is not at all clear that  had the issues been raised by the applicant for consideration  the evidence would have remained as it was before the Tribunal  As discussed in more detail below  in the course of considering the several matters raised by the applicant  the matters now raised under     and   above and possibly in   above may have led to there being more evidence before the Tribunal pertaining to them  For example  there may have been evidence from Dr Macris as to the significance  if any  of the additional medical history to him issuing the CMF to the respondent  There may have been evidence from Dr Bauze and Dr Brooks  and perhaps other evidence  as to the relationship between the diseased condition of the respondent s right knee and the aggravation of the diseased condition of his left knee  There may have been further evidence from the applicant about his state of mind at the time he was examined by Dr Macris concerning his capacity to do the proposed work on the Iron Chieftain  There may have been other relevant communications between the applicant and the respondent  or between the applicant and others such as medical practitioners  That is not of course intended to be exhaustive  or necessarily correct  It is really speculative as to how the hearing before the Tribunal would have proceeded if those issues had been properly signalled  Such considerations  however  do indicate that it would not be appropriate now to permit those matters to be raised  see  eg  Coulton v Holcombe   HCA         CLR   at     University of Wollongong v Metwally  No     HCA         ALJR   at    I

applicant submitted that Australian Meat Holdings Pty Ltd v Kazi     Qd R   supported its contention  In that case it was held that a contract of employment was void  so the injured person was not a worker within the meaning of s   of the WorkCover Queensland Act    Qld  and could not claim compensation against his employer  The definition of  worker  in s   was  an individual who works under a contract of service   It was found that the contract of employment was void  so that the injured person was not working under a contract of service and so was not a worker  The contract was found to be void because the claimant in that case was an unlawful non citizen in Australia  Section   of the Migration Act    Cth  made it an offence for an unlawful non citizen in Australia to perform work in Australia in the circumstances then applicable  Hence  the Court found that the claimant in that case could not enter into a contract of service  see especially at      A similar result was reached

Pty Limited v First Chicago Australia Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gibbs ACJ said    Where a statute imposes a penalty upon the making or performance of a contract  it is a question of construction whether the statute intends to prohibit the contract in this sense  that is  to render it void and unenforceable  or whether it intends only that the penalty for which it provides shall be inflicted if the contract is made or performed      At   Mason J said        the question is whether the statute intends merely to penalize the person who contrives the prohibition or whether it intends to go further and prohibit contracts the making of which constitute  the breach   In deciding this question the court will take into account the scope and purpose of the statute and the consequences of the suggested implication with a view to ascertaining whether it would conduce to  or frustrate  the object of the statute citedVisscher v Munro   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  One of the principal purposes of the Navigation Act is to ensure the safety of ships and crew in Australian waters  see Visscher v Munro   FCAFC         FCR   at    The Marine Orders  as I have said  may also be interpreted in that context  However  I do not think that it follows that a contract of employment procured by a person with a CMF which has been issued despite  or because of  misleading or incomplete information provided to the doctor concerned necessarily would frustrate that objective  The Marine Orders  and in particular the CMF  aims to ensure that the crew on a ship are physically fit for the duties which they are to undertake so that they are not a danger to themselves or to others or to the ship  Dr Macris undertook his own examination of the respondent  As a result of that examination  he observed that the respondent had normal use of the arms and legs  normal gait  and did not have any apparent defect of the bones or joints  enjoyed movements of the joints in the normal range and without pain  and did not have any restriction or pain in the movement of the spine   It would follow from the applicant s contention that a misleading or inaccurate or incomplete disclosure on a medical information form  even one irrelevant to the particular person s fitness to undertake work proposed to be undertaken on a ship  would lead to the invalidity of the CMF  For example  through oversight  an applicant for a CMF may simply not disclose a previous medical condition  such as an appendix removed  and be visited with the consequence that the CMF itself is invalid  and  as the applicant contends  that there is therefore no valid employment subsequently undertaken on the basis of the CMF which has been issued  I do not think such a construction is necessary to fulfil the object of the Marine Orders as part of the service of the purposes of the Navigation Act   Nor does that construction provide the certainty which the CMF is intended to provide  as a foundation for employment  it would be     a provisional foundation vulnerable to identifying at some later time and perhaps at a much later time that all along the employment has been invalid  Such an outcome does not lie easily with the definitions in the marine Orders to which I have referred   In my view  the second step is equally problematical for the applicant  In addition  there is nothing in the Seafarers Act itself to support the contention for the reasons just discussed  An employee is defined in s   to include a seafarer  and a seafarer is defined in s   to include a person employed in any capacity on a prescribed ship  As a matter of fact  the respondent was employed on the Iron Chieftain operated by the applicant  On the clear wording of s   of the Seafarers Act  if the respondent as an employee suffered an injury which resulted in his incapacity for work  compensation was payable to him for that injury under the Seafarers Act  It would be a wholly disproportionate consequence of the applicant s contention that he would be ineligible for compensation  even if the non disclosure or incomplete disclosure of his medical condition was accidental or through oversight  or if it related to a condition which had no relevance to his capacity to perform his duties  It is difficult to accept that outcome would have been intended in legislation which has a significant social objective  The analysis of the relative significance of the information which has been either not disclosed or inaccurately reported regarding the past medical history  and its relationship to the injury  or of the reasons for its non disclosure or inaccurate disclosure  is not one upon which  in my view  the entitlement to compensation under the Seafarers Act are predicated  That may be one of the situations which  subject to considering the applicant s further contentions  ss   or   of the Seafarers Act is designed to cover  The disproportionality to which I have referred is a relevant consideration to the construction for which the applicant contends  cf Nonferral  NSW  Pty Ltd v Taufia     NSWLR   at    Indeed  the point was made in Visscher   FCR at   that a medical certificate is not conclusive of the question of fitness to undertake particular duties  In that case  the Full Court at   adopted a submission of counsel that        the regulatory scheme that is established by the  Navigation  Act and the Orders is a licensing system of a familiar generic sort  of which the issuing of medical certificates is part  It does not  either expressly or impliedly  deal with the contractual relationship between employers and employees citedNonferral  NSW  Pty Ltd v Taufia     NSWLR   In my view  the second step

and  b  are not intended to so restrict a claimant for compensation under the Seafarers Act  At the time a claim for compensation is made  it will often be the case that the precise nature of the injury or its aetiology  as ultimately found  will not be apparent either to the claimant or to his medical advisers  see e g  Lees v Comcare     ALD   at    I consider that the nature of the injury as expressed in the claim was sufficient to put the applicant on notice as to the general nature of the injury or injuries which the respondent claimed to have suffered  so that the applicant could exercise its right to require a medical examination under s   of the Seafarers Act and to seek information about and from the respondent under s   of the Seafarers Act  It is not suggested in the submissions that the notification contained in the claim in any way impeded the applicant from undertaking those inquiries  In addition  as the course of hearing before the Tribunal illustrates  there was medical evidence adduced from both Dr Brook and Dr Bauze that the applicant had suffered an aggravation of his left knee disease unrelated to  or only marginally related to the medial meniscal condition in his left knee  The applicant permitted the proceeding to be conducted on that basis  including testing the medical evidence  It did not object to that evidence as being irrelevant to the claim  nor indeed could it sensibly have done so   It is convenient to address these two contentions of the applicant together citedZickar v MGH Plastic Industries Pty Limited   HCA           CLR

clear that the Tribunal proceeded on the basis that the respondent had a pre existing degenerative condition of his left knee which constituted a  disease  and that his injury arose because that pre

judgment  were reasonably open to the Tribunal  It accepted the respondent s evidence that  prior to his commencement of employment on the Iron Chieftain  he did not have ongoing symptoms of pain in

acknowledges that there is no false and wilful misrepresentation to the effect that he did not suffer  and had not previously suffered from  a degenerative condition in his left knee  That is the disease specifically which the Tribunal found had been aggravated by the respondent s employment with the applicant  The respondent s evidence was that he had previously had trouble with his left knee in   when he had been learning to drive a truck with a heavy clutch  but that the problem had resolved following physiotherapy  It was not contended by the applicant that that circumstance was sufficient to have obliged the respondent by reason of s   to have disclosed specifically the previously degenerative condition of his left knee because it is now shown that he was aware of it  It is not a circumstance where the respondent failed to disclose a symptom of a disease in the left knee in circumstances where it ought to have been disclosed  as distinct from the suffering of a particular and temporary injury  cf Re Schofield and Comcare     ALD     The medical evidence indicated that the respondent had an underlying degenerative condition of both his knees  but does not firmly indicate that those degenerative conditions were related  or that the incapacity caused by aggravation of the degenerative condition in the left knee was related to the degenerative condition in the right knee  Reference need only be made to the report of Dr Bauze of   September   and of the respondent s general practitioner  Dr Chambers  in his report of   October   discussed in the Tribunal s reasons   The applicant submitted that  the relationship between degenerative conditions in knees is hardly controversial   That may or may not be correct as a matter of general medical science  but it does not address the particular findings of fact  or the particular evidence in this case  As its contentions indicate  there was some medical evidence considering the relationship between the degenerative conditions of the respondent s right knee and his left knee  The issue was not fully explored because  in the particular circumstances  it was not a matter upon which the Tribunal was required to make  or made  a finding favourable to the contention of the applicant  It merely found that the respondent had a degenerative condition of his left knee which had been aggravated by his employment with the applicant  leading to incapacity for work  That state of the evidence does not enable me to make any finding on the issue  as potentially authorised by s   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth    In those circumstances  in my judgment  the applicant has not shown in any event that the respondent made a wilful and false representation that he did not suffer  or had not previously suffered  from a degenerative condition in his left knee or had not suffered and did not suffer from the aggravation of that condition when he applied for his CMF or subsequently  In this particular case  the Tribunal did not make the finding upon which the applicant s contention is premised and in fact did not find that the degenerative conditions in the applicant s right and left knees were a single ailment  and should therefore be treated as a single disease  It made a different finding  The finding was open to it   Consequently  the condition upon which s   would operate as a matter of fact to disentitle the applicant from compensation under the Seafarers Act has not been shown by the applicant to have been made out  and indeed its premise is inconsistent with the finding which the Tribunal in fact made citedJohnson v Marshall Sons   Co Ltd   AC   The Tribunal adopted the view that it was necessary to consider the facts of the particular

the assessment of whether  in particular circumstances  serious and wilful misconduct has been established  is a question of fact to be decided in all the circumstances of the particular case  In my judgment  the Tribunal did not err in law in approaching the matter in that way   A similar statutory scheme and factual circumstances to those now under consideration were considered by Judge Stanley in Ismakovich   SAIR    His Honour said at   after considering the equivalent of s   in the Workers Compensation Act    SA  that    The legislature has therein specifically provided that  if after being warned of the consequences of his action  the worker wilfully and falsely represents himself in writing as not having previously suffered from an injury which is a disease and he subsequently suffers such injury arising out of or in the course of his employment with that employer  compensation shall not be payable in respect of that injury     It seems to me implicit from the inclusion of that provision in that section that the legislature did not regard the wilful making by a worker of a false statement concerning any prior injury as amounting to  serious and wilful misconduct  within the meaning of section   for  if such a statement was already embraced by that term  there was no necessity to enact that portion of the provision of section        The same can be said for s   and s   of the Seafarers Act  However  I do not need to decide that question   Even assuming that a wilful and false misrepresentation made in seeking employment could be brought within the serious and
