austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The substantive judgment in this proceeding was handed down on   November   APF Properties Pty Ltd v Kestrel Holdings Pty Ltd  No     FCA    Further argument has now been heard as to the amount for which judgment should be entered and the question of costs   I have found that the applicant is entitled to judgment against the first and second respondents  the Robinsons  and the fourth respondent  Mantach  for damages being the difference between the price paid for Broadmoor and Lower Wilmot and the true value of those properties at the time of purchase  together with certain expenses and interest  The Robinsons were the vendors of the properties and Mantach was a valuer which provided a valuation on which the applicant purchaser relied   It was accepted  at least implicitly  at the substantive hearing that if the applicant paid too much for the property it followed that it borrowed too much and the damages should include interest paid on the excess borrowing citedKing v Yurisich  No     FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In arguing against giving the offer any costs consequence Mr Cawthorn SC for Mantach  supported by Mr Ayliffe for the Robinsons  contended that the form of offer required all of the respondents to accept it  Contrary to O   r   it did not specify separately the offer made to each party  It was not possible for Mantach alone  or as Mr Ayliffe says  the Robinsons alone  to accept the offer in accordance with its terms  Reference was made to the decision of the Full Court of this Court in King v Yurisich  No     FCAFC   at   where their Honours said    There does not appear to be any basis under the terms of O   for the proposition that an offer made to all respondents can be accepted only by one  The fund made an offer which required all four respondents to whom it was made to accept its terms  If one respondent failed to accept  the fact that the other three had sought to would not have been a compliance with the terms of the offer  Moreover  in those circumstances there would be nothing which the respondents who wanted to accept the offer could do to comply with its terms  If the fund were correct in its construction of O   this would mean that any respondent who had wanted to accept the offer but was unable to persuade the others to do so  would be responsible for the payment of costs on an indemnity basis notwithstanding that respondent s attempt to satisfy the offer so far as it could  Given that the obliging respondent had no power to compel the others to act reasonably or to accept the offer  the consequence would be unacceptably harsh   Reference was also made to the decision of Byrne J in the Supreme Court of Victoria in Aquatec Maxcon Pty Ltd v Barwon Water Authority  No     VSC   at          However  it is not necessary to decide whether King prevents such a conclusion  Even if the offer did not comply with Order   it was nevertheless not a nullity  The making and non acceptance of it are facts which happened and which are relevant to the exercise of the discretion as to costs  The only difference is that if Order   does not apply there is no presumptive entitlement to indemnity costs  MGICA   Pty Ltd v Kenny   Good Pty Ltd  No       FCR   at     Recently a Full Court of the Federal Court in WSA Online Limited v Arms  No     FCAFC   said at   citing MGCIA     A Calderbank offer does not carry the same presumptive entitlement to indemnity costs  but the public policy of encouraging settlement of litigation should nevertheless lead the Court to make an order for indemnity costs where a Calderbank offer has been made in terms which are clear and where it is appropriate to do so   It is worth noting that one of the aspects of the offer being considered in WSA Online was that it was made to a number of parties and one of them could not accept it independently without the agreement of others  Nevertheless the Full Court said at   this  was not a matter which conclusively operates against the costs order sought   In King at   the later Full Court cited WSA Online with no suggestion of

Broadmoor and Lower Wilmot than they were truly worth  Each respondent was facing the same monetary liability  as I have held  recent statutory provisions for proportionate liability were not applicable   It was open to either respondent to pay the   and  failing agreement with the other respondent  to proceed with its cross claim  in the course of which it could have made its own Order   offer or a Calderbank offer  see Calderbank v Calderbank     All ER    If either respondent had agreed to pay   it would have been significantly better off than it now is  each respondent being liable to the applicant for    True it is Mantach now has a right of indemnity against the Robinsons for the full amount  but as its counsel accepted  it would have had a right of recovery against the Robinsons back in March had it accepted the   offer  And Mantach would have had greater prospects of effective recovery had the Robinsons  assets not been depleted by a fourteen day trial  Even if Mantach had to run a case against the Robinsons to judgment  that would have been a substantially less expensive exercise than the three cornered contest which in fact took place   Put another way  there would have been no practical difference if the applicant had addressed an offer to the Robinsons offering to accept   and an otherwise identical document addressed to Mantach also offering to accept    It would be an odd and formalistic result if the fact that the offers were in the one document made a critical difference   In MGICA there was no Order   offer but there had been a

J said at   that the obligation to exercise the discretion judicially        does not mean  and it is wrong to think  that the law requires that the discretion be exercised in a certain way in a particular case because of the presence or absence of factors which may have been persuasive in an earlier case  How the discretion is to be exercised in a particular case depends on all relevant

conclusively operates against the costs order sought   In King at   the later Full Court cited WSA Online with no suggestion of disapproval   In this regard I note that prior to trial the applicant reached a compromise with the fifth respondent Harrison Humphreys Pty Ltd  a valuer against whom the applicant pleaded substantially the same case as it did against Mantach  The terms of that settlement are not known to the Court  and would not be relevant if they were  The point is  however  that it was possible for the applicant in the circumstances of the present case to settle with one of several respondents  Outside the specific requirements of Order   the Court is in the area of general discretion as to indemnity costs  The fact that  as a matter of contract law  an offer might not have been capable of acceptance by one respondent is not conclusive against an award of indemnity costs  WSA Online  citedColgate Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited     FCR   The locus classicus on the subject is still the decision of Sheppard J in Colgate Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited     FCR    His Honour at   noted that the power to order such costs is not  to be circumscribed in any way  and  at   that the power  is not so circumscribed that an order of this character may be made only against an ethically or morally delinquent party   His Honour at   noted as one of the circumstances which have been thought to warrant the exercise of the discretion  an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise    In my opinion in the present case the refusal of the applicant s offer was imprudent  It was made when the parties  evidence  or at least the great bulk of it  was available in affidavit form  It would have been apparent to an objective observer that there was  at the lowest  a serious risk of a Court finding that there had been a gross misrepresentation as to the croppable areas of Broadmoor and Lower Wilmot and that this had led  along with other factors  to a gross over valuation  as demonstrated  apart from anything else  by the result of the subsequent sales  The objective observer would also have been aware that it would take a long and expensive trial for the applicant to run its case to judgment   I will order that the Robinsons and Mantach pay the applicant s costs on a party and party basis up until   March    being   days from the date of the offer  and thereafter on an indemnity basis   There is no opposition to an extension to   February   of the time for filing and serving a notice of appeal   I certify that the
