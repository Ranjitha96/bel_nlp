Citizenship   FCAFC       ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlCounsel for the Respondent Minister has properly referred to the following conclusion of Lander J in SZIZO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC       ALD       It should only be in exceptional circumstances that a Court should refuse to issue the constitutional writs once the court has determined that the Tribunal has failed to comply with its imperative statutory obligations to an applicant seeking the review of a decision of the delegate refusing the applicant a protection visa  If it were otherwise  and the Court were required to inquire into the extent to which the failure by the Tribunal to comply with its statutory obligations to accord an applicant a fair hearing prejudiced the applicant  the imperative obligation imposed on the Tribunal might well be blunted     His Honour had there previously referred to the following observations of Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Re Refugee Review Tribunal  Ex parte Aala   HCA       CLR         It is one thing to refuse relief on the ground of utility because  as Lord Wilberforce put it   t he court does not act in vain    Malloch v Aberdeen Corporation     WLR   at       All ER   at    For example  the application for an administrative determination may be one which  irrespective of any question of procedural fairness or individual merits  the decision maker was bound by the governing statute to refuse   Mobil Oil Canada Ltd v Canada Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Board     SCR   at   Wade and Forsyth  Administrative Law     th ed   at    Or the prosecutor s complaint may be the refusal by the decision maker of an opportunity to make submissions on a point of law which must clearly have been answered unfavourably to the prosecutor  See Stead v State Insurance Commission   HCA         CLR   at    Again  the decision under review may have no legal effect and no continuing legal consequences may flow from it  In such a situation  the reasoning in Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission   HCA         CLR   at     where the remedy refused was certiorari  indicates that prohibition will not lie   Abebe v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at                However  the conditioning of a statutory power so as to require the provision of procedural fairness has  as its basis  a rationale which differs from that which generally underpins the doctrine of excess of power or jurisdiction  The concern is with observance of fair decision making procedures rather than with the character of the decision which emerges from the observance of those procedures  Unless the limitation ordinarily implied on the statutory power is to be rewritten as denying jurisdictional error for  trivial  breaches of the requirements of procedural fairness  the bearing of the breach upon the ultimate decision should not itself determine whether prohibition under s  v  should go  The issue always is whether or not there has been a breach of the obligation to accord procedural fairness and  if so  there will have been jurisdictional error for the purposes of s  v      Moore and Marshall JJ agreed with Lander J citedSZKGF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe written submissions as filed on behalf of the Respondent Minister did not   urge upon the Court a duty to inquire into each case the extent to which any failure may have prejudiced an applicant    What was urged upon the Court was the appropriateness   to withhold relief in circumstances where there is a clear absence of any practical injustice or even inconvenience to an applicant resulting from any error in question    Reliance was placed upon SZKGF v Minister for Immigration and

observations of Middleton J in SZGBI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   at   to   where His Honour indicated that relief may have been refused for a breach of s  A of the Migration Act    Cth  citedSZMTJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FMCA  That subsequent application was rejected by a delegate of the Minister on   May   and the Refugee Review Tribunal affirmed that decision by a decision signed on   August    An application for review was filed with the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia in September    An amended application was filed on   November   and identified two grounds  namely   i   The investigation conducted by the Second Respondent was affected by bias and preoccupied subjective reasoning   and    ii  a breach of s  R of the Migration Act    Cth     The amended application was dismissed  SZMTJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FMCA    In dismissing the application  the Federal Magistrate relevantly concluded that   a  the now Appellant failed to provide any evidence of any bias on the part of the Tribunal and the first ground set forth in the amended application was to be dismissed  and    b  a breach of s  R  had in fact occurred  but that   c  relief should be refused in the exercise of the Court s discretion  The Notice of Appeal as filed in this Court on   February   raises essentially the same grounds as were advanced before the Federal Magistrate  Although the Notice of Appeal does not expressly assert error on the part of the Federal Magistrate in the exercise of discretion  the written Outline of Submissions as filed by the Respondent Minister correctly addresses the question as to whether the discretionary withholding of relief has miscarried citedTaylor v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe expression    the interests of justice   as employed in Rule   is a   wide term   Taylor v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at   per French J  As His Honour there made clear  the decision to issue a referral is no indication by the Court of the strengths or weaknesses of a particular case  In the present proceeding it is considered that it is in   the interests of the administration of justice   that a referral be made  A person seeking refugee status in Australia who has established a breach of an important provision of the Migration Act   is not to be lightly denied relief  The significance to be attached to a breach of s  R  and the importance of that provision to the decision making process need to be addressed  The proper basis upon which any such discretion should be exercised  and whether it is appropriate when exercising that discretion for the Federal Magistrate to himself embark upon an assessment of the weight of the evidence before the Refugee Review Tribunal  are both matters in respect to which the Court would be greatly assisted by hearing from a legal practitioner on the Pro Bono Panel  Although it may well be that the ground of appeal alleging bias on the part of the Tribunal is not a ground that is ultimately relied upon  it is not considered appropriate at this stage to confine the assistance that may be provided pursuant to O   r    The legal practitioner to whom this matter is referred may abandon some grounds or seek to raise grounds not presently identified  Such matters will be matters for the professional judgment of the legal practitioner concerned
