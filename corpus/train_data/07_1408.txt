Repatriation Commission v Sergeant   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedMcKenna v Repatriation Commission   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  I note that  in interpreting and applying ss   and  A   of the Act   the Tribunal is required to ask and answer the question whether there is in force a Statement of Principles  or multiple Statements of Principles  determined under s  B of the Act   that upholds the whole   not just part  of the Veteran s hypothesis  McKenna v Repatriation Commission   FCA         FCR   at      Further  a relevant hypothesis must consist of a link or links which connect  at one end  the type of death suffered by the Veteran  which is the basis of the claim under the Act   with  at the other end  the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the Veteran  McKenna   FCR at    Each of these links must be upheld by a Statement of Principles and  if need be  more than one Statement of Principles  McKenna   FCR at     In this case the cause of death on the Veteran s death certificate was stated to be        a   Cerebrovascular accident with  seizure   b  Hypertension   c  Epilepsy          Ischaemic heart disease  cerebral haemorrhage  transient ischaemic attack   Ms Bowskill for the applicant submitted that the Act requires more than a factual linking between  in this case  hypertension and operational service  As made clear in McKenna   FCA       FCR   all  links  in the hypothesis must be supported by Statements of Principles  Accordingly  having regard to the links contained in the hypothesis advanced before the Tribunal in addition to the three Statements of Principle already mentioned  it was also necessary for the Tribunal to have regard to the Statements of Principles concerning anxiety disorder  Instrument No   of   and panic disorder  Instrument No   of    However  no reference was made by the Tribunal to the Statements of Principles concerning anxiety disorder and panic disorder  Accordingly  it follows from that submission that  contrary to the finding of the Tribunal  the second Deledio step was not satisfied   In my view it is appropriate that the decision of the Tribunal be set aside and the matter be remitted to the Tribunal for a rehearing  not only for the reason conceded by Ms Skennar  but also on the basis that  to the extent that any hypothesis is identifiable in circumstances where the Tribunal has not specifically identified an hypothesis  the Tribunal has not properly identified and addressed Statements of Principles that uphold the whole of that hypothesis  If  for example  the hypertension of the Veteran was caused by anxiety or a panic disorder  that link in the hypothesis needs to be supported by the relevant Statements of Principles  The link between the war service and the hypertension is not substantiated nor supported by identified Statements of Principles in these proceedings as required by McKenna   FCA       FCR    In any event  I also note that any possible hypothesis referable to ingestion of salt by the Veteran could not  in circumstances where the point was unequivocally abandoned  have properly formed the basis for decision by the Tribunal   In light of the usual rule that costs follow the event  the success of the Repatriation Commission  and the fact that the Repatriation Commission has sought an order that its costs be paid by the respondent  it follows that an appropriate order is that the Repatriation Commission s costs of the appeal be met by the respondent  However at the hearing  Ms Skennar for the respondent submitted that the Court should exercise its discretion pursuant to s   Federal Proceedings  Costs  Act    Cth  to grant a costs certificate  Section   provides  so far as relevant      Subject to this Act   where a Federal appeal succeeds on a question of law  the court that heard the appeal may  on the application of a respondent to the appeal  grant to the respondent a costs certificate in respect of the appeal          The certificate that may be granted under subsection   or   by a court to a respondent to a Federal appeal is a certificate stating that  in the opinion of the court  it would be appropriate for the Attorney General to authorise a payment under this Act to the respondent in respect of         a  the costs incurred by the respondent in relation to the appeal  and   b  any costs incurred by an appellant in relation to the appeal that have been  or are required to be  paid by the respondent to the appellant in pursuance of an order of the court  not being costs to which a costs certificate granted under section   relates   It is not in contention that s   is enlivened in this case  The matter before me is a Federal appeal  and it has succeeded on a question of law  The issue however is whether the Court should exercise its discretion to grant the certificate referred toRepatriation Commission v Cornelius   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In summary  Ms Skennar has submitted that relevant factors for the Court to consider in exercising its discretion are        the fact that the respondent s husband was a war veteran  Repatriation Commission v Cornelius   FCA       by making appropriate concessions  the respondent limited the appeal to a short point    although no new issue of law has arisen in this matter  the appeal results in a confirmation of the steps that must be taken in considering an application such as this  particularly in circumstances where there is more than one hypothesis connecting the veteran s death to his war service    the critical issue in this matter is that the Tribunal failed to give appropriate reasons identifying each of the steps taken    a further concession in relation to the ingestion of salt might have been forthcoming if the Repatriation Commission had provided further submissions with respect to the hearing before the Tribunal to Ms Skennar prior to the hearing before this Court  rather than providing relevant documents to her the morning of the hearing   However  Ms Bowskill for the applicant submitted in summary that the Court should not exercise its discretion pursuant to s   because        appeals of this nature from the Tribunal only involve questions of law  so they can only ever succeed on a question of law    the material with respect to the ingestion of salt  in particular the transcript of the hearing before the Tribunal  was material to which the respondent s legal representatives would already have had access    the decision of Branson J in Cornelius   FCA   serves to support the submission that it is not appropriate to grant a costs certificate in this case   In my view there are no circumstances in this case which warrant departure from the usual rule that costs follow the event  I make this finding for the following reasons   First  as pointed out by Branson J in Cornelius   FCA     a submission that a costs certificate should be granted only because a Veteran is a party to the proceeding  is not sustainable  Her Honour continued     I am unable to discern any such legislative intent in the Act   Section   of the Act   in my view  requires that each application for a certificate  including each application made on behalf of a war veteran  be considered individually and on its merit    This is not to discount the significance of   the special contribution made by war veterans to protecting Australian society in time of war    Parliament has given recognition to this special contribution in the Veterans  Entitlements Act    Cth  by  amongst other things  providing for a relatively low standard of proof to be applied in the determination of whether a veteran s death  injury or disease is war caused  The Executive Government has given recognition to the special contribution in the formulation of the Commonwealth guidelines for the administration of legal aid  It seems to me that the status of a respondent as a war veteran is a factor which may be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion to grant a certificate under s   of the Act   However  I am not persuaded that it is a factor which either compels  or necessarily suggests strongly in favour of  the grant of a certificate  As indicated above  each application must be considered on its merits    Second  although it is commendable that the respondent made appropriate concessions thus limiting the appeal to a short point  the obvious response is that such an approach has the beneficial effect of limiting costs which may arise in the appeal rather than justifying a complete relief from the obligation to pay costs appliedRepatriation Commission v Deledio     FCR   The course of reasoning which ss   and  A of the Act require a decision maker to take in relation to a claim lodged under the Act for a pension arising out of operational service rendered by a Veteran was authoritatively articulated by the Full Court in Repatriation Commission v Deledio     FCR    The relevant principles are as follows         The Tribunal must consider all the material which is before it and determine whether that material points to a hypothesis connecting the injury  disease or death with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the person  No question of fact finding arises at this stage  If no such hypothesis arises  the application must fail      If the material does raise such a hypothesis  the Tribunal must then ascertain whether there is in force a Statement of Principles determined by the Authority under s  B  or    If no such Statement of Principles is in force  the hypothesis will be taken not to be reasonable and  in consequence  the application must fail      If a Statement of Principles is in force  the Tribunal must then form the opinion whether the hypothesis raised is a reasonable one  It will do so if the hypothesis fits  that is to say  is consistent with the  template  to be found in the Statement of Principles  The hypothesis raised before it must thus contain one or more of the factors which the Authority has determined to be the minimum which must exist  and be related to the person s service  as required by ss  B d  and  e   If the hypothesis does contain these factors  it could neither be said to be contrary to proved or known scientific facts  nor otherwise fanciful  If the hypothesis fails to fit within the template  it will be deemed not to be  reasonable  and the claim will fail      The Tribunal must then proceed to consider under s   whether it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the death was not war caused  or in the case of a claim for incapacity  that the incapacity did not arise from a war caused injury  If not so satisfied  the claim must succeed  If the Tribunal is so satisfied  the claim must fail  It is only at this stage of the process that the Tribunal will be required to find facts from the material before it  In so doing  no question of onus of proof or the application of any presumption will be involved   In this case the Tribunal found that        on the balance of probabilities  a cerebrovascular accident was a main cause of the death of the Veteran  Tribunal decision at   and    the whole of the material pointed to a hypothesis connecting the death of the Veteran with the circumstances of his service  and accordingly the first Deledio step was satisfied  Tribunal decision at     The Tribunal did not identify the relevant hypothesis  This was conceded by the respondent  However  as Ms Bowskill for the applicant submitted  the relevant hypothesis may be inferred as        that the Veteran s death was caused by cerebrovascular accident    the cerebrovascular accident was caused by hypertension    the hypertension was caused by either an anxiety disorder or panic disorder suffered by the Veteran    the anxiety disorder or panic disorder was caused by the Veteran s operational service   The Tribunal identified that three Statements of Principles were relevant in relation to this claim  namely        Statement of Principles for Cerebrovascular Accident  Instrument No   of   and Instrument No   of     Statement of Principles for Ischaemic Heart Disease  Instrument No   of   as amended by Instrument No   of     Statement of Principles for Hypertension  Instrument No   as amended by Instrument No   of     I note that the Tribunal in its decision referred to these Statements of Principles as relevant to a hypothesis connecting the death of the Veteran to the circumstances of the case  and found that in this respect the second Deledio step was satisfied  Tribunal decision at     Ms Bowskill for the applicant submitted that the Act requires more than a factual linking between  in this case  hypertension and operational service  As made clear in McKenna   FCA       FCR   all  links  in the hypothesis must be supported by Statements of Principles  Accordingly  having regard to the links contained in the hypothesis advanced before the Tribunal in addition to the three Statements of Principle already mentioned  it was also necessary for the Tribunal to have regard to the Statements of Principles concerning anxiety disorder  Instrument No   of   and panic disorder  Instrument No   of    However  no reference was made by the Tribunal to the Statements of Principles concerning anxiety disorder and panic disorder  Accordingly  it follows from that submission that  contrary to the finding of the Tribunal  the second Deledio step was not satisfied   Third  no new issue of law arose in this litigation  and indeed I have found that the reasons for setting aside the decision of the Tribunal were that not only was there a failure to articulate a hypothesis as required by the first Deledio step  but also that relevant Statements of Principles had not been identified to support each link in that hypothesis as required by the second Deledio step   Finally  although I understand Ms Skennar s submission concerning the stage in the proceedings before me at which the Repatriation Commission had drawn her attention to concessions made by the respondent s Counsel below  in my view this is answered by Ms Bowskill s submission that the material with respect to the ingestion of salt  in particular the transcript of the hearing before the Tribunal  was material to which the respondent s legal representatives   in particular the solicitors   would already have had access   As no circumstances exist which warrant the Court exercising its discretion pursuant to s   Federal Proceedings  Costs  Act    Cth  the appropriate order is that the respondent pay the applicant s costs of the appeal     THE COURT ORDERS THAT         The decision of the Tribunal whereby the Tribunal set aside the decision of the Veterans  Review Board made on   November   and decided  that the death of the late Mr Charles Sergeant is war caused within the meaning of s   of the Veterans  Entitlements Act     be set aside      The matter be remitted to the Tribunal to have the question whether the death of the late Mr Charles Sergeant is war caused heard and decided again      The respondent pay the applicant s costs of the appeal    I certify that the preceding twenty
