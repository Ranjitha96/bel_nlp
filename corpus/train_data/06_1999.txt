Test Document v Test Document   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldiscussedAWB Limited v Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlAs argued before me  the case focused on three issues  The first issue is whether AWB has established its claim that legal professional privilege attaches to each of the documents that remain in contest  The only head of privilege that AWB relies on is the privilege that attaches to documents brought into existence for the dominant purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice  In AWB Limited v Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole   FCA      AWB v Cole    I held that litigation privilege was not available to protect documents brought into existence in contemplation of the Commission and none of the parties has disputed that decision  AWB has not contended that legal professional privilege is available solely because documents were brought into existence in contemplation of inquiries being undertaken by the PSI or by the IIC  The second issue is whether  assuming privilege attaches  that privilege has been waived by virtue of AWB s disclosure of the gist or substance of certain legal advices which it obtained  I will have to determine whether waiver should be imputed to AWB as a matter of law and  if so  what is the extent of that waiver  The Commonwealth contends that the waiver extends to all documents that relate to Project Rose and Project Water  The third issue is whether legal professional privilege attaches to documents that came into existence in connection with AWB s settlement of a claim by GBI for a rebate of approximately US  million on account of the fact that earlier shipments of wheat by AWB had been contaminated by iron filings  the iron filings claim   The Commonwealth contends that the iron filings claim is inextricably linked with the Tigris transaction  in that the prices for wheat contracts A  and A  were inflated to cover both the amount of the iron filings claim and the repayment by GBI of the debt which it owed to Tigris  It said that AWB proposed to pay the iron filings claim directly to Alia as an addition to inland transport fees  but spread over several contracts  The Commonwealth argued that the inflation of the contract prices to cover the iron filings claim was concealed from the United Nations and that it involved a contravention of the United Nations  sanctions  In these circumstances  the Commonwealth contends that AWB cannot maintain its claim to privilege over the legal advice it obtained in relation to the iron filings claim as that advice was obtained in furtherance of a fraud  wrongful conduct or sham transaction  I reviewed the relevant authorities and extracted the principles which govern legal advice privilege in my decision in AWB v Cole at     and      I adhere to what I said in that case  I do not propose to engage in a lengthy discussion of the authorities concerning legal advice privilege in these reasons for judgment  other than to the extent necessary to address the arguments advanced by the parties  The general principles that I consider relevant to the disposition of this case can be summarised as follows The Commonwealth contended that Project Rose and Project Water were purely factual investigations and therefore should not be regarded as attracting any legal professional privilege  In advancing this contention  the Commonwealth tended to assume that factual investigations by lawyers  such as a review of documents and interviews of persons involved in the matter under investigation  can be separated from the ultimate legal advice given by the lawyers as a result of their factual investigation  Leaving aside any question of waiver  this seems to be an unduly narrow approach to the scope of legal advice privilege  In my view  it finds no support in the authorities  In recognition of the fact that legal professional privilege is a fundamental common law right  the courts have eschewed an overly narrow or technical approach to the identification of communications or documents that fall within the scope of legal advice privilege  As I said in AWB v Cole at     the legal advice limb of the privilege extends beyond material that is literally a communication  or a record of a communication  of legal advice or instructions  In Propend at   Gummow J said that the privilege extends to any document prepared by a lawyer or client from which one might infer the nature of the advice sought or given  The principle extends to internal documents or parts of documents of the client  or of the lawyer  reproducing or otherwise revealing communications which would be covered by privilege  Bank of Nova Scotia v Hellenic Mutual War Risks Association  Bermuda  Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   at   per Saville J  In Three Rivers   the relevant legal context consisted of a commission of inquiry into the part played by the Bank of England in the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA  The House of Lords upheld the Bank of England s claim that legal advice privilege attached to documents that had been generated for the purposes of providing information to the Bank s legal advisers to enable them to prepare submissions and evidence  and to advise on the nature  presentation  timing and content of the Bank s responses to the inquiry  Relevant passages from the speeches in the House of Lords are extracted in my decision in AWB v Cole at      The Commonwealth contended that AWB had failed in its attempt to prove legal professional privilege because it had not adduced any proof as to AWB s dominant purpose in seeking or obtaining legal advice  AWB largely relied upon evidence given by in house and external lawyers involved in the particular communications at issue  The Commonwealth submitted that evidence proving the lawyer s understanding of the purpose of the particular communication and that he or she was giving legal advice affords no evidence of the client s dominant purpose  There is no real substance in this criticism  Dominant purpose must be determined objectively  but it is not uncommon for the relevant purpose to be established by evidence given by the maker of the statement or another person responsible for commissioning the relevant document or bringing it into existence  such as a solicitor  see Mitsubishi Electric Australia Pty Ltd v Victoria WorkCover Authority   VSCA         VR   at     Grant v Downs at   and AWB v Cole at    Toohey and Gummow JJ dissented in separate judgments  Each expressed the view that waiver should not be imputed because the disclosures by Goldberg were made to a third party for a limited and specific purpose  Toohey J said at   that the following factors militated strongly against any implied or imputed waiver  first  Goldberg disclosed material to the Society because of a complaint against him on an undertaking by the Society that the contents would be kept confidential  secondly  the disclosure was made in the context of the Society s investigation of a complaint in pursuance of its statutory powers and  consequently  it could be regarded as having been made for the purposes of the Act  and thirdly  the disclosure was confined to the Society  Gummow J said at   that  as the disclosures were made in the context of compulsory statutory processes  the circumstances of the case supplied no sufficient reason for depriving Goldberg of privilege  even allowing for the advantage he sought to gain by making the disclosure  The applicable principles are set out in my decision in AWB v Cole at      The authorities draw a distinction between a mere reference to the existence of legal advice  which will not usually amount to a waiver  and cases in which the gist or substance of the legal advice has been disclosed  see Maurice at     and   Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co  Canberra  Ltd   HCA         ALJR   at   Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co  Canberra  Ltd     NSWLR   Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd v Spalvins     FCR   at     and Bennett v Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service   FCAFC         FCR     Bennett    at          In Propend   the High Court considered whether a charge of improper purpose must be based on evidence that is admissible in the proceeding  The only evidence of alleged illegality before the trial judge in Propend was the sworn information which supported the issue of a search warrant for the relevant documents  The Court held that  while the sworn information was admissible to establish the basis upon which the warrant was issued  it was not admissible to show that the copy documents were not privileged  see at   per Brennan CJ    per McHugh J    per Gummow J    per Gaudron J  and   per Kirby J  The iron filings claim refers to a claim by GBI for a rebate of US    on account of the fact that earlier shipments of wheat by AWB to GBI had been contaminated by iron filings  Lindberg agreed to pay this sum to GBI in settlement of the iron filings claim in about October   during the course of a visit to Bagdad  An email dated   November   from Chris Whitwell of AWB  Whitwell  to Lindberg and others reporting on the trip to Iraq in October   stated that the responsible Iraqi Minister had asked for repayment of the iron filings rebate through the  inland transport mechanism   The same email referred to the fact that the Iraqi Minister was seeking cabinet approval for repayment of the Tigris debt  At the outset of this case  the Commonwealth contended that any legal advice that AWB obtained in connection with the Tigris transaction was waived by virtue of AWB s production to the Commission of a partly masked memorandum of   February   dealing with the subject of the iron filings payment and Tigris petroleum fee  On the first day of the hearing  AWB announced that it was no longer seeking a declaration of privilege in respect of documents connected with the Tigris transaction which the Commonwealth sought to challenge on the basis of the fraud exception  Subsequently  AWB made it clear that this concession did not extend to six documents relating to the iron filings rebate payment  During the course of the hearing in this Court  AWB produced an unmasked copy of the memorandum of   February   and provided it to the Commonwealth  The Commonwealth tendered the memorandum as an exhibit in this proceeding  without any objection from AWB  The memorandum contains a fairly full description of the way in which AWB planned to pay the iron filings claim to GBI  The memorandum  which was sent by Whitwell to Messrs Geary and Long  with copies to Scales  Johnson  Hogan  Johnstone  Cooper  Lyons  Hockey and Thomas  states      AND CONFIDENTIAL     memo is in respect to refunding the Grain Board of Iraq the quality rebate of approx USD   through the inland transport payments for the new contract as requested by the Minister of Trade  Iraq  In addition  for the record IS   M has negotiated  through an uplift in price  the recovery of a USD     million outstanding debt to Tigris by IGB through this contract  AWB will repay this debt back to Tigris less an agreed recovery fee of USD   K on a pro rata basis as tonnage is shipped  Overview     led by Andrew Lindberg  August   to Baghdad agreed to settle the contamination of the  Iron Filings  vessels by paying them USD   pmt for each vessel total   USD       being approached by Tigris Petroleum AWB and IGB have agreed to allow the new contract to be the conduit for a repayment of USD   owed to Tigris by IGB for a cargo of wheat shipped in    IGB have agreed to raising the contract price by the debt amount and when payments are made under the Letter of Credit AWB will pay Tigris its debt less AWBs recovery fee      have suggested the following during our last two visits      Offsetting the debt against the Outstanding debt to  Tigris petroleum   approx USD     million          Reducing the any new contract price  sic  by the amount of the rebate on a pmt basis         Repaying the debt through the provision of aid in some form   Wheat  Health supplies etc          in discussion with the Minister of Trade he has continually   insisted on repayment directly as an addition to the inland transport and said that this was his understanding of the agreement with Andrew Lindberg   Michael Long was present and confirms that this was discussed  Now that the new contract has been concluded ISM need a sign off to organise this payment when shipments start  Issues     Possible implications for AWB on a corporate governance basis ie  direct payment to a company with links to the Iraqi regime may be construed to be in contravention of the UN Sanctions          relevant UN Security Council Resolution is      This resolution provides at clause       States shall not make available to the Government of Iraq or to any commercial  industrial or public utility undertaking in Iraq any funds or any other financial or economic resources and shall prevent their nationals and any persons within their territories from removing from their territories or otherwise making available to that Government or to any such undertaking any such funds or resources and from remitting any other funds to persons or bodies within Iraq     except payments exclusively for strictly medical or humanitarian purposes and  in humanitarian circumstances  foodstuffs       summary  this means that the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia would be obliged to prevent AWB Limited from making any remittance of funds to the IGB      Legal opinion in this regard is set out below      does not mean  however  that a payment might not be able to be made which will comply with the terms of the UN Resolutions  As a minimum  if AWB management determines to make the payment  then it should be made in the following circumstances      The payment is made in installments over time and coincides with payments for future shipments of wheat  ie not a lump sum payment      The payments preferably be made to a company other than the IGB and in a jurisdiction other than Iraq  and     The payments be recorded as being made as a part of a settlement reached between AWB and IGB  the terms of which contemplated that IGB would agree not to take any action against AWB for the alleged contamination of the   vessels in   with iron filings AND would agree to enter into contracts for the purchase of Australian bulk wheat in the future in exchange for a renegotiation of the price on the   vessels      we ensure that the above requirements are met  then Legal consider it will be at least arguable that we are not  making funds or financial resources available to the Iraqi Government   Instead  we are repaying part of the contract price for the   vessels following a re negotiation of the sale price due to a downgrading of the grain  which potentially contained iron filings       addition to the above the UN Security Council resolutions also require  resolution     clause   that the cost of food exports to Iraq must be met by draw down from the UN  escrow account   Furthermore draw down from the escrow account is only allowable under strict conditions  Those conditions include  at clause  a iii  that the goods to which payment is referable shall have arrived in Iraq  In this case  the goods have already arrived in Iraq and HAVE been paid for in full  However  the Resolutions are SILENT on the procedure for any repayment of part of the price in circumstances where there has been a quality complaint  and a subsequent renegotiation of price       may therefore give us more scope to make the repayment to IGB      if we make payment as outlined above  there is still a risk that the Australian Government and or the United Nations will take a contrary view on the interpretation of the above mentioned resolutions and declare that AWB has breached the terms of those resolutions by making the payment  This is a commercial and political issue  which AWB s management will need to consider      According to an informal discussion with DFAT any repayment of a quality rebate should be either re payed through UN ESCROW account or as a contract price reduction however they have not had a full legal argument put in front of them or been told officially  In Public affairs opinion as long as the repayment is legal and could not be seen to be breaking UN Sanctions then we should proceed  with the proviso that we have an independent legal opinion to that effect   see above legal opinion           Affairs also expressed concern that this would not be well received by the UN OIP office and that there was a reasonable chance of them finding out  IS   M on the other hand do not want them involved and feel confident that this issue could be handled without the need for the OIP to be consulted  It has been articulated to us and we have circumstantial evidence that other participants in the OIP program  Russian and Pakistani companies  have had to sort out quality problems in a similar way and it is unlikely either their national governments or the OIP were consulted     IS   M feel strongly that a failure to repay the IGB as discussed will lead to serious consequences for AWBs relationship with the IGB  IS   M also believe that failure to refund this agreed debt in this way would have serious implications for the execution of the new contracts  AWBI are aware of all the issues laid out above and in light of the commercial imperative of this situation agree with the recommendation as laid out below  They do however insist that the Managing Director is appraised of the situation      Actions     IS   M have received a number of different opinions from different areas of AWB and an informal opinion from DFAT we still feel this issue is a grey area with no prescriptive answers  Based on the opinions we do have and the commercial circumstances surrounding this issue IS   M recommend and seek approval for the following      IS   M is to repay debt as per method outlined in AWBs legal opinion  and requested by the Minister of Trade  directly to Alia Transport in Jordan in instalments  IS   M will also look to obtain written agreement from IGB to the payment in the format agreed by legal however it is not guaranteed          Managing Director only to convey our intentions to the Australian Government at the appropriate time prior to Shipment  The timing of such a disclosure is important and we would recommend that nothing be done until at least Letters of Credit are in place for these contracts  Given that this is unlikely to happen until after a war with Iraq it may allow us a further chance of renegotiation with a new regime          IS   M to finalise as soon as possible a written agreement with Tigris with regard to the settlement of their debt    Original emphasis omitted approvedEsso Australia Resources Limited v Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlUnder the legal advice

with AWB s submission that  even if its disclosures were not compelled by law  the inquisitorial context in which they took place is a factor which strongly militates against waiver  In Australia  legal professional privilege is a fundamental common law right that can be asserted outside the context of adversarial litigation  It can  for instance  be invoked to resist the production of documents in answer to a search warrant or the giving of information or the production of documents pursuant to coercive statutory powers or notices  Daniels at         and     Baker v Campbell   HCA         CLR    As legal professional privilege can be invoked outside the context of judicial or quasi judicial proceedings  logic suggests that it should be capable of being waived if the claimant engages in conduct that is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality that the privilege is intended to protect  It should not matter whether the conduct takes place within  or outside  the framework of the proceedings or investigatory process in which a demand has been made for the production of privileged documents or information  The crucial question is whether the conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality citedWaterford v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAWB placed particular reliance on Dawson J s formulation of the scope of legal advice privilege in Waterford v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at       legal professional privilege relied upon in this case is that which attaches to communications between a legal adviser and his client for the purpose of giving or receiving legal advice and to documents recording those communications or containing information for the purpose of enabling the advice to be given  In order to attract that privilege  the communications must be confidential and the legal adviser must be acting in his professional capacity  see Minet v Morgan   Wheeler v Le Marchant   Smith v Daniell   Bullivant v Attorney General  Vict     Jones v Great Central Railway Co   O Rourke v Darbishire        There is nothing controversial about this formulation

VSCA         VR  http www austlii edu au au cases vic VSCA  htmlThe Commonwealth contended that AWB had failed in its attempt to prove legal professional privilege because it had not adduced any proof as to AWB s dominant purpose in seeking or obtaining legal advice  AWB largely relied upon evidence given by in house and external lawyers involved in the particular communications at issue  The Commonwealth submitted that evidence proving the lawyer s understanding of the purpose of the particular communication and that he or she was giving legal advice affords no evidence of the client s dominant purpose  There is no real substance in this criticism  Dominant purpose must be determined objectively  but it is not uncommon for the relevant purpose to be established by evidence given by the maker of the statement or another person responsible for commissioning the relevant document or bringing it into existence  such as a solicitor  see Mitsubishi Electric Australia Pty Ltd v Victoria WorkCover Authority   VSCA         VR   at     Grant v Downs at   and AWB v Cole at   appliedMann v Carnell   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe kind of waiver that is in issue in this case is commonly referred to as imputed or implied waiver  The former expression is preferable  as it reflects the way in which the High Court expressed the governing legal principles in Mann v Carnell   HCA         CLR      Mann     In Mann at     Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  Gummow and Callinan JJ said      may be express or implied  Disputes as to implied waiver usually arise from the need to decide whether particular conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect  When an affirmative answer is given to such a question  it is sometimes said that waiver is  imputed by operation of law   This means that the law recognises the inconsistency and determines its consequences  even though such consequences may not reflect the subjective intention of the party who has lost the privilege  Thus  in Benecke v National Australia Bank   the client was held to have waived privilege by giving evidence  in legal proceedings  concerning her instructions to a barrister in related proceedings  even though she apparently believed she could prevent the barrister from giving the barrister s version of those instructions  She did not subjectively intend to abandon the privilege  She may not even have turned her mind to the question  However  her intentional act was inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality of the communication  What brings about the waiver is the inconsistency  which the courts  where necessary informed by considerations of fairness  perceive  between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality  not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large  The concluding part of this passage draws attention to the fact that the test for imputed waiver had previously been expressed in terms of fairness  see Attorney General  NT  v Maurice   HCA         CLR     Maurice    at   per Gibbs CJ      per Mason and Brennan JJ      per Deane J  and     per Dawson J  Under the test propounded in Mann   it is inconsistency between the conduct of the client and the maintenance of the confidentiality that the privilege is intended to protect which effects a waiver of the privilege  Fairness has become a subsidiary consideration  it may be relevant to the court s assessment of inconsistency in some contexts but not in others  In Commissioner of Taxation v Rio Tinto Limited   FCAFC     Rio Tinto    at   the Full Court  Kenny  Stone and Edmonds JJ  said that there was a good deal of doubt whether the language used by the majority in Mann worked any real change in the principle which governs imputed waiver  This observation was made somewhat tentatively and was not material to the Court s decision  My own view is that a test expressed in terms of inconsistency more readily accommodates the variety of situations in which questions of imputed waiver can arise than a test expressed in terms of fairness  The criterion of fairness is readily understandable in the context of inter partes litigation  but it is difficult to apply sensibly in other contexts  see the observations by McHugh J in Mann at     and Toohey J in Goldberg v Ng   HCA         CLR     Goldberg v Ng    at    AWB submitted that this Court should hold that there has been no imputed waiver because the Commonwealth has made no attempt to identify why it would be unfair or inequitable for AWB to maintain privilege in the underlying investigations  This submission immediately raises the question unfair or inequitable to whom  I doubt that any question arises of fairness to the Commission it is an arm of the executive government charged with the investigation of specified matters  Nor does any question arise of fairness to the Commonwealth  Fairness presupposes a balancing of interests between parties who are in dispute  In that context  partial disclosures raise a question of fairness because there is the capacity to mislead one party to the dispute to his or her detriment  These concepts do not translate easily to the present case  cf McHugh J in Mann at        There is also the difficulty that  outside the framework of an inter partes dispute  fairness is truly a term of  indeterminate reference  Mann at     per McHugh J  citing RJ Desiatnik  Legal Professional Privilege in Australia     p    Mann anticipated that there will be cases in which considerations of fairness have little or no role to play  This is such a case  The broad question posed by Mann is whether  and to what extent  AWB s disclosures are inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the documents which are at issue in these proceedings  This question wraps up several subsidiary issues  in particular whether AWB s disclosures involved  on each occasion  a disclosure of the gist or substance of its legal advice  whether AWB consciously deployed that advice so as to advance its own commercial or other interests  and  if so  whether that disclosure has resulted in an imputed waiver of privilege over any and what associated materials  In any application of Mann   the starting point must be an analysis of the disclosures or other acts or omissions of the party claiming privilege that are said to be inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the privileged material  see Rio Tinto at    The disclosures in question here were made variously to the IIC  to the Australian Government  to the Commission and in some instances via the procedures of the Commission to the public at large  In my opinion  there is no reason why these disclosures cannot support a finding that AWB has waived legal professional privilege over associated material  AWB submitted that imputed waiver cannot arise in the context of a commission established under the RCA  Alternatively  it submitted that the coercive and inquisitorial context in which the alleged waiver has taken place is an important factor which strongly militates against waiver  These submissions ignore the voluntary disclosures that AWB made to the Australian Government  In any event  I am not persuaded that AWB s disclosures to the Commission and the IIC are incapable of giving rise to an imputed waiver  Leaving aside any question of waiver  AWB was entitled to maintain legal professional privilege in the course of proceedings before the Commission and  by and large  it sought to do so  To the extent that AWB has already produced documents to the Commission containing legal advice or instructions  it did so because it recognised that actions it had taken outside the Commission had the consequence of waiving privilege over those documents  As for the oral evidence that the Commonwealth now relies upon  Lindberg  Cooper and Scales were senior executives of AWB when they gave that evidence to the Commission  There is nothing before me to suggest that they were not speaking as executives of AWB when they gave their evidence  or that their evidence fell outside the scope of their authority from AWB  Further  their evidence was given in the presence of AWB s legal representatives  without any objection being raised on grounds of legal professional privilege  Lindberg  Cooper and Scales may have been compelled to give evidence at the Commission  but they were under no compulsion to reveal the gist or substance of legal advice that had been obtained by AWB  The disclosure of privileged communications to a third party can result in an imputed waiver of privilege  even if there is no intention of waiving privilege and the disclosure is for a limited and specific purpose  In Mann   the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory conveyed legal advice  on a confidential basis  to a member of the Territory s Legislative Assembly to enable him to consider the reasonableness of the Government s decision to settle certain legal proceedings  The majority decision turned on the fact that the disclosure to a member of the Legislative Assembly was not regarded as disclosure to a third party  In their joint judgment  Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  Gummow and Callinan JJ said at     that      purpose of the privilege being to protect the Territory from subsequent disclosure of the legal advice it received concerning the litigation instituted by the appellant  there was nothing inconsistent with that purpose in the Chief Minister conveying the terms of that advice  on a confidential basis  to a member of the Legislative Assembly who wished to consider the reasonableness of the conduct of the Territory in relation to the litigation      However  their Honours also observed that  while the voluntary disclosure of privileged legal advice to a third party will not necessarily waive privilege  it can do so  They said that Goldberg v Ng illustrates that  depending on the circumstances  the disclosure of a privileged communication to a third party for a limited and specific purpose  and on terms as to confidentiality  can have the consequence of waiving privilege  In Network Ten Ltd v Capital Television Holdings Ltd     NSWLR   which predated Goldberg v Ng and Mann   Giles J held that a limited and specific disclosure of privileged material  on terms of confidentiality  did not result in a loss of privilege  In Australian Rugby Union Ltd v Hospitality Group Pty Ltd     ALR   Sackville J said that it follows from Goldberg v Ng that the disclosure of a privileged communication for a limited purpose and subject to a confidentiality requirement may  or may not  amount to a waiver of privilege  depending on the circumstances of the case  at          On the facts of that case  Sackville J held that a disclosure of legal advice to the solicitors and representatives of two other companies  on strict terms as to confidentiality and for the purpose of those other companies obtaining legal advice  did not result in an imputed waiver  His Honour distinguished Goldberg v Ng as a case in which the disclosure was made to gain an advantage over the opposing party in related litigation  at     discussedAttorney General  NT  v Maurice   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe concluding part of this passage draws attention to the fact that the test for imputed waiver had previously been expressed in terms of fairness  see Attorney General  NT  v Maurice   HCA         CLR     Maurice    at   per Gibbs CJ      per Mason and Brennan JJ      per Deane J  and     per Dawson J  Under the test propounded in Mann   it is inconsistency between the conduct of the client and the maintenance of the confidentiality that the privilege is intended to protect which effects a waiver of the privilege  Fairness has become a subsidiary consideration  it may be relevant to the court s assessment of inconsistency in some contexts but not in others  The applicable principles are set out in my decision in AWB v Cole at      The authorities draw a distinction between a mere reference to the existence of legal advice  which will not usually amount to a waiver  and cases in which the gist or substance of the legal advice has been disclosed  see Maurice at     and   Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co  Canberra  Ltd   HCA         ALJR   at   Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co  Canberra  Ltd     NSWLR   Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd v Spalvins     FCR   at     and Bennett v Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service   FCAFC         FCR     Bennett    at          Turning to the scope of any imputed waiver  it is well established that a voluntary disclosure of privileged documents can result in a waiver of privilege over those documents and associated material  The test applied to determine the scope of any waiver of associated material is whether the material that the party has chosen to release from privilege represents the whole of the material relevant to the same issue or subject matter  Maurice at   and   per Gibbs CJ    per Mason and Brennan JJ  and     per Dawson J  In Maurice   Gibbs CJ said at       Similarly  where a party disclosed a document which contained part only of a memorandum which dealt with a single subject matter  and then read the document to the judge in the course of opening the case  it was held that privilege was waived as to the whole memorandum  Great Atlantic Insurance Co v Home Insurance Co   In that case Templeman LJ said          the rule that privilege relating to a document which deals with one subject matter cannot be waived as to part and asserted as to the remainder is based on the possibility that any use of part of a document may be unfair or misleading  that the party who possesses the document is clearly not the person who can decide whether a partial disclosure is misleading or not  nor can the judge decide without hearing argument  nor can he hear argument unless the document is disclosed as a whole to the other side  Once disclosure has taken place by introducing part of the document into evidence or using it in court it cannot be erased       same test must be applied in deciding whether the use in legal proceedings of one document impliedly waives privilege in associated material  In Nea Karteria Maritime Co Ltd v Atlantic   Great Lakes Steamship Corporation  No   Mustill J dealt with this question and suggested the following test          where a party is deploying in court material which would otherwise be privileged  the opposite party and the court must have an opportunity of satisfying themselves that what the party has chosen to release from privilege represents the whole of the material relevant to the issue in question  To allow an individual item to be plucked out of context would be to risk injustice through its real weight or meaning being misunderstood  AWB relied upon the way in which the principle was formulated by the Court of Appeal in British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd v Cowell   VSCA         VR   at           reference in one letter of advice to an earlier letter of advice does not expose the latter to scrutiny by the other party to litigation merely because legal professional privilege is waived in relation to the former  implied waiver is not so generous a doctrine  As we apprehend it  where legal professional privilege is waived in relation to one piece  or part  of advice  the privilege is impliedly waived in relation to another if   and only if   that other is necessary to a proper understanding of the first  As established by the High Court  at least since Mann v  Carnell   the test in such cases is whether it would be  inconsistent  for a party to rely upon  and so to waive legal professional privilege in respect of  the one without also being taken to have waived privilege in respect of the other      It is no doubt correct that a mere reference to the existence of legal advice in a disclosed document will not be regarded as a waiver of its contents  albeit a different conclusion would follow if the gist  substance or conclusion of the legal advice is voluntarily disclosed  But  with great respect to their Honours  the proposition concerning waiver of associated material is expressed too narrowly and in a way that is not consistent with the test propounded by the High Court in Maurice   The principle propounded by the Court of Appeal may work adequately enough in some circumstances  particularly where privilege is sought to be maintained over one part of a single piece of legal advice  but in other circumstances it will not give effect to the principles explained in Maurice  A common application of associated material waiver relates to the case where an expert report has been prepared in reliance upon other documents  In Australian

disclosure of a privileged communication to a third party for a limited and specific purpose  and on terms as to confidentiality  can have the consequence of waiving privilege  McHugh J dissented  In his view  any disclosure of privileged material to a third party who is a stranger to the privileged relationship  ie to a person who is not the lawyer or the client  should have the consequence that privilege in that material is waived as against the world  at                  As I read his Honour s judgment  the key reason why his Honour preferred a bright line rule of this kind is that it would ensure that legal professional privilege was not extended beyond the rationales that support it  at           candid communications between a lawyer and a client is unlikely to be endangered if a privilege holder is held to waive privilege because he or she has voluntarily disclosed the communication to a stranger  Whether the communication will be disclosed in the future to a stranger to the privilege is entirely within the control of the client  At that stage  the client will determine whether his or her interests are best served by retaining the privilege or disclosing the communication  But it is difficult to see how the possibility of voluntary disclosure will prevent the client being candid with his or her lawyer          client who voluntarily discloses privileged information to a stranger to the privileged relationship has made a choice  based no doubt on considerations personal to him or her  that the purpose for which the communication is disclosed to the stranger is more important than protecting the absolute confidentiality of the communication by preventing the stranger from having knowledge of it  The person may be encouraged to do so  as in Goldberg v Ng   by an expectation that the stranger will not further disclose the communication  But in my opinion  if privileged material is voluntarily disclosed to a stranger to the privileged relationship  the fact that it may be received under an obligation of confidence should not be relevant to whether privileged is waived      On the facts  McHugh J considered that disclosure to a member of the Legislative Assembly who was not a member of the Executive Government was relevantly a disclosure to a stranger to the privileged relationship  at      In Goldberg v Ng   the respondents sued their solicitor  Goldberg  for failure to account for monies received and disbursed by him as their solicitor  They also made a professional conduct complaint against him to the Law Society of New South Wales  In answer to the complaint  Goldberg prepared statements  with annexures that included a draft brief to counsel  and submitted them to the Society s professional conduct department  In doing so  Goldberg told the Society that the statements and the annexures were confidential and he wished to retain his legal professional privilege in them  The Society dismissed the complaint on the ground that there was no evidence of professional misconduct or unsatisfactory professional conduct  Subsequently  in the course of the Supreme Court proceedings instituted by the respondents against Goldberg  the respondents served a subpoena on the Society requiring it to produce documents relating to the complaint against Goldberg  All of the members of the High Court held that there had been no express or intentional waiver by Goldberg of his legal professional privilege in the statements and annexures  The issue that divided the Court was whether waiver should be imputed by operation of law  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ held at     that it should because the professional complaint and the Supreme Court proceedings were but different emanations of the one dispute  and Goldberg s provision of the statements to the Society was voluntary and for the calculated purpose of demonstrating the reliability of his denial of the alleged failure to account  Their Honours analysed the issue in terms of  fairness  but they could equally  and perhaps more appropriately  have done so in terms of inconsistency  In Network Ten Ltd v Capital Television Holdings Ltd     NSWLR   which predated Goldberg v Ng and Mann   Giles J held that a limited and specific disclosure of privileged material  on terms of confidentiality  did not result in a loss of privilege  In Australian Rugby Union Ltd v Hospitality

  CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlI do not agree with AWB s submission that  even if its disclosures were not compelled by law  the inquisitorial context in which they took place is a factor which strongly militates against waiver  In Australia  legal professional privilege is a fundamental common law right that can be asserted outside the context of adversarial litigation  It can  for instance  be invoked to resist the production of documents in answer to a search warrant or the giving of information or the production of documents pursuant to coercive statutory powers or notices  Daniels at         and     Baker v Campbell   HCA         CLR    As legal professional privilege can be invoked outside the context of judicial or quasi judicial proceedings  logic suggests that it should be capable of being waived if the claimant engages in conduct that is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality that the privilege is intended to protect  It should not matter whether the conduct takes place within  or outside  the framework of the proceedings or investigatory process in which a demand has been made for the production of privileged documents or information  The crucial question is whether the conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality consideredRestom v Battenberg   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct

the category A and the category B documents was in accordance with its duty to assist in the conduct of the criminal proceedings  and could not properly be construed as an express or implied waiver of its rights in its own civil litigation  Indeed  it would in my view be contrary to public policy if the plaintiff s action in making the documents available in the criminal proceedings had the effect

Extrajudicial Disclosure Situations   University of Illinois Law Review    The US courts have also considered whether a disclosure of privileged material to government investigators will have the consequence of waiving privilege  In re Sealed Case   the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia considered whether a corporation that had submitted its own investigating counsel s report into alleged bribes and improper payments to the Internal Revenue Service and the Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  pursuant to voluntary disclosure programs had thereby impliedly waived its privilege over documents which were clearly identified in the report  The Court held that  by revealing part of privileged communications to the agencies to gain a commercial advantage  the corporation had made a disclosure which was inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality  Accordingly  the Court held that the corporation had waived privilege as to all other communications relating to the same subject matter  The principle applied by the Court was that  at         need not allow a claim of privilege when the party claiming the privilege seeks to use it in a way that is not consistent with the purpose of the privilege  Thus  since the purpose of the attorney client privilege is to protect the confidentiality of attorney client communications in order to foster candor within the attorney client relationship  voluntary breach of confidence or selective disclosure for tactical purposes waives the privilege  Disclosure is inconsistent with confidentiality  and courts need not permit hide and seek manipulation of confidences in order to foster candor  Dawson J discussed the authorities at        Geo  Doland Ltd v Blackburn Robson Coates   Co waiver of privilege with respect to a conversation between solicitor and client  which took place before litigation was contemplated  was held to extend to any other communications in relation to the subject matters of the conversation  although the implied waiver was held not to cover similar documents which came into existence for the purpose of prosecuting the litigation  This decision was not followed in General Accident Corporation Ltd v Tanter where a distinction was drawn between the waiver of privilege before a trial and the further waiver of privilege by calling evidence in a trial  In the latter situation the waiver was held to extend to the transaction constituted by the privileged communication but not to the subject matter of that communication arising upon other privileged occasions  General Accident Corporation Ltd v Tanter has been criticized for the distinction which it draws between waiver by the tender of evidence of a privileged communication and waiver by the disclosure of the communication in some other way and for the restriction which it places upon the extent of associative waiver  see Phipson on Evidence   par      In Nea Karteria Maritime Co Ltd v Atlantic   Great Lakes Steamship Corporation  No     a broader view was taken by Mustill J that       where a party chooses to deploy evidence which would otherwise be privileged the court and the opposition must  in relation to the issue in question  be given the opportunity to satisfy themselves that they have the whole of the material and not merely a fragment   This view was approved by the Court of Appeal in Great Atlantic Insurance Co v Home Insurance Co   In the United States it has been widely held that voluntary disclosure of the content of a privileged attorney communication constitutes waiver of the privilege with respect to all other such communications upon the same subject matter  Weil v Investment Indicators  Research and Management and the cases there cited  Diotima Shipping Corp v Chase

 FCAFC         FCR     Bennett    at          In Bennett   the Full Court  Tamberlin  Emmett and Gyles JJ  held that legal representatives of the Australian Customs Service had waived privilege in legal advice by stating openly that they had given advice to Customs that a particular regulation did not prohibit public comment by an officer on matters of public administration  The trial judge had held that a disclosure of the legal position or stance that a lawyer had advised a client to take was not inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the communication giving the advice  The trial judge also appeared to draw a distinction between statements which disclose the conclusion or logical result of legal advice  and statements which disclose the content of the legal advice and its reasoning  see Tamberlin J at     and Gyles J at      The Full Court rejected this approach  Gyles J stated at     that the voluntary disclosure of the gist or conclusion of the legal advice amounts to waiver in respect of the whole of the advice to which reference is made  including the reasons for the conclusion  Tamberlin J said at         my view  it would be inconsistent and unfair  having disclosed and used the substance of the advice in this way  to now seek to maintain privilege in respect of the relevant parts of that advice which pertain to the expressed conclusion  It may perhaps have been different if it had been simply asserted that the client has taken legal advice and that the position which was adopted having considered the advice  is that certain action will be taken or not taken  In those circumstances  the substance of the advice is not disclosed but merely the fact that there was some advice and that it was considered  However  once the conclusion in the advice is stated  together with the effect of it  then in my view  there is imputed waiver of the privilege  The whole point of an advice is the final conclusion  This is the situation in this case  Subsequently  Tamberlin J was confronted with a case that was very similar to the one he hypothesised in Bennett   In Nine Films and Television Pty Ltd v NINOX Television Ltd     IPR   the applicant contended that the respondents had waived privilege in various legal advices because of the way in which the respondents had publicly referred to the advice  Tamberlin J held that there had been no

apparent that the advice is that specified action should be taken  His Honour also made the following observations at           I accept that  in some circumstances  a clear disclosure of the  bottom line  of the advice  and the course of conduct taken thereafter  may be sufficient to amount to waiver of legal professional privilege  I do not think these matters have been established in the present case  On a fair and reasonable reading  the statement to the effect that senior counsel had been engaged and that he had reviewed matters in detail and that steps were being taken based on his recommendations is not sufficient to amount to a waiver of the legal advice  The substance or content of the advice is not disclosed with specificity or clarity  Questions of waiver are matters of fact and degree and  in this instance  I am not persuaded that the conduct  assertions or admissible evidence are sufficient to warrant the necessary implication that legal professional privilege has been waived  The principles discussed in Bennett were applied in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd  No       FCA    The issue was whether a statement in a discovered document that  o ur legal advice is that the risk of damages being awarded against Optus is low  had the consequence of waiving privilege in the legal advice that it referred to  Sackville J held that it did  the statement voluntarily disclosed the gist or conclusion of the legal advice  at    AWB submitted that the reasoning in Bennett was unsound  particularly the holding that the disclosure of the conclusion stated in legal advice will amount to a waiver of the whole of the advice  AWB did not refer to any authorities that supported this submission and I reject it  In my view  it is well established that a voluntary disclosure of the gist  substance or conclusion of legal advice will amount to a waiver in respect of the whole of the relevant advice consideredNine Films and Television Pty Ltd v NINOX Television

Services Ltd v Cowell   VSCA         VR   at           reference in one letter of advice to an earlier letter of advice does not expose the latter to scrutiny by the other party to litigation merely because legal professional privilege is waived in relation to the former  implied waiver is not so generous a doctrine  As we apprehend it  where legal professional privilege is waived in relation to one piece  or part  of advice  the privilege is impliedly waived in relation to another if   and only if   that other is necessary to a proper understanding of the first  As established by the High Court  at least since Mann v  Carnell   the test in such cases is whether it would be  inconsistent  for a party to rely upon  and so to waive legal professional privilege in respect of  the one without also being taken to have waived privilege in respect of the other      It is no doubt correct that a mere reference to the existence of legal advice in a disclosed document will not be regarded as a waiver of its contents  albeit a different conclusion would follow if the gist  substance or conclusion of the legal advice is voluntarily disclosed  But  with great respect to their Honours  the proposition concerning waiver of associated material is expressed too narrowly and in a way that is not consistent with the test propounded by the High Court in Maurice   The principle propounded by the Court of Appeal may work adequately enough in some circumstances  particularly where privilege is sought to be maintained over one part of a single piece of legal advice  but in other circumstances it will not give effect to the principles explained in Maurice discussedAustralian Securities   Investments Commission v Southcorp Ltd     ACSR  A common application of associated material waiver relates to the case where an expert report has been prepared in reliance upon other documents  In Australian Securities   Investments Commission v Southcorp Ltd     ACSR   at       Lindgren J summarised the applicable principles      Ordinarily the confidential briefing or instructing by a prospective litigant s lawyers of an expert to provide a report of his or her opinion to be used in the anticipated litigation attracts client legal privilege  cf Wheeler v Le Marchant     Ch D   Trade Practices Commission v Sterling     FLR   at   Interchase Corp Ltd  in liq  v Grosvenor Hill  Qld  Pty Ltd  No       Qd R    Interchase  at   per Pincus JA  at   per Thomas J      Copies of documents  whether the originals are privileged or not  where the copies were made for the purpose of forming part of confidential communications between the client s lawyers and the expert witness  ordinarily attract the privilege  Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR    Propend      Interchase   per Pincus JA  Spassked Pty Ltd v Cmr of Taxation  No       ATR   at            Documents generated unilaterally by the expert witness  such as working notes  field notes  and the witness s own drafts of his or her report  do not attract privilege because they are not in the nature of  and would not expose  communications  cf Interchase at     per Thomas J          Ordinarily disclosure of the expert s report for the purpose of reliance on it in the litigation will result in an implied waiver of the privilege in respect of the brief or instructions or documents referred to in   and   above  at least if the appropriate inference to be drawn is that they were used in a way that could be said to influence the content of the report  because  in these circumstances  it would be unfair for the client to rely on the report without disclosure of the brief  instructions or documents  cf Attorney General  NT  v Maurice   HCA         CLR   at      per Gibbs CJ  CLR      per Mason and Brennan JJ  CLR        per Deane J  CLR      per Dawson J  Goldberg v Ng   HCA         CLR   at      per Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  CLR      per Toohey J  Instant Colour Pty Ltd v Canon Australia Pty Ltd   FCA        Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Lux Pty Ltd   FCA      at             Similarly  privilege cannot be maintained in respect of documents used by an expert to form an opinion or write a report  regardless of how the expert came by the documents  Interchase at   per Pincus JA  at   per Thomas J          It may be difficult to establish at an early stage whether documents which were before an expert witness influenced the content of his or her report  in the absence of any reference to them in the report  cf Dingwall v Commonwealth of Australia     FCR   Tirango Nominees Pty Ltd v Dairy Vale Foods Ltd  No       FCR   at      ACCC v Lux at    appliedThomas v New South Wales   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  htmlIn Thomas v New South Wales   NSWSC     Thomas    McClellan CJ at Common Law applied these principles to the documents which underpinned or supported the advice of counsel  His Honour stated at       in the present case the primary document for which privilege was expressly waived was the advice of counsel  I can discern no difference in principle between such an advice and the advice or report of an expert retained for the purpose of the litigation  As I have indicated  I am satisfied that counsel relied upon instructions which they were given and  it would appear  relied upon medical reports in a way which influenced the content of the advice which they gave  Accordingly  insofar as there are documents which were relied upon in the preparation of the advice falling within categories       and   of the notice to produce  the service of the affidavit impliedly waived privilege in those documents       Later at   his Honour said      In the present case the plaintiff disclosed the advice in these proceedings for the purpose of obtaining whatever assistance he could from that advice in pursuit of his claim  To my mind  that disclosure waived his privilege both in the advice itself and the documents which were used by counsel and which influenced the content of the advice  Waiver having occurred  the fact that the advice was not ultimately tendered is  to my mind  not relevant  Having sought an advantage  the plaintiff was bound by the course he had taken and accordingly is amenable to producing the relevant documents in response to an appropriate notice to produce  According to the authorities discussed above  the limits of any waiver of associated material depend upon the nature of the advice that has been disclosed  what was represented by means of the disclosure  and the character of the transaction that gave rise to the disclosed legal advice  Regard must also be had to the way in which AWB s legal advice was described in the various disclosures  Essentially  by means of the disclosures  AWB was asserting that a detailed legal review had been undertaken  and that it had concluded that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing or other improper conduct by AWB in connection with its sale of wheat to Iraq under the OFF Programme  In my opinion  the nature and character of this disclosure is inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in those documents which were taken into account by AWB s legal advisers in arriving at the advice they gave  To adapt the language used by McClellan CJ at Common Law in Thomas at   and   AWB s disclosures of its legal advice effect a waiver of privilege in the documents which were reviewed for the purposes of that advice or which influenced its content  Furthermore  AWB emphasised the breadth of its internal review in its various disclosures  In my view  AWB thereby waived privilege in documents which define the scope of the review or which reveal what investigations were in fact undertaken in the course of the review consideredNewcrest Mining  WA  Limited v Commonwealth     FCR  In Newcrest Mining  WA  Limited v Commonwealth     FCR   French J applied the principle of associated material waiver in a case where one joint venturer disclosed significant elements of legal advice it had obtained in relation to mining leases held by the joint venture partners  His Honour held that the disclosure brought about an implied waiver of other legal advices obtained by the other joint venturers in relation to the mining leases  His Honour said at   that it was significant that the disclosures were made for the benefit of the joint venture as a whole and  although there was no direct evidence on the point  he considered that it was difficult to imagine that the disclosures would have occurred against the wishes of the other joint venturers or indeed without their consent citedDunlop Slazenger International Ltd v Joe Bloggs Sports Limited   EDWCA Civ  In England  the principle has been applied to documents which underpin or support expert evidence  see Dunlop Slazenger International Ltd v Joe Bloggs Sports Limited   EDWCA Civ   Mayne Pharma Pty Ltd v Debiopharm SA   EWHC    Pat  and L Oreal SA v Bellure NV   EWHC    Ch  approvedNea Karteria Maritime Co Ltd v Atlantic   Great Lakes Steamship Corporation  No     Com LR  Several English cases illustrate the practical operation of the principle  In Nea Karteria Maritime Co Ltd v Atlantic   Great Lakes Steamship Corporation  No     Com LR     Nea Karteria    a lawyer gave evidence that he had conducted an interview on the basis of a list of questions prepared by the plaintiffs  lawyers  While privilege was waived with respect to the witnesses  answers  the plaintiffs sought to maintain privilege with respect to the list of questions  at      Mustill J  as his Lordship then was  held at   that privilege over the list of questions had been waived by implication      seems to me that the written questions were  so to speak  part of the meeting  They were in a sense an agenda for the meeting  They formed the basis for one half of the exchange between the lawyer and  the witness   Evidence to that effect having been given by the lawyer  it seems to me that privilege must have been waived for those questions  And I think the interests of justice  which I believe to underlie the authorities on this part of the case  demand that the opposition and the court should have an opportunity to satisfy itself as to the accuracy of the evidence given to the lawyer as to the way in which he conducted the interview  Mustill J drew a distinction at   between the instructions to the lawyer who carried out the questioning and the questions themselves  the instructions did not play a part in the meeting  did not form part of the body of events upon which the Court had to reach conclusions of fact  and were merely part of the prior history of those events  In R v Secretary of State for Transport  Ex parte Factortame     Admin LR   at   Auld LJ made the following observations concerning the application of the test stated in Nea Karteria       depends on whether the party making partial disclosure seeks to represent by so doing that the disclosed documents go to part or the whole of an  issue in question  the expression used by Mustill  J in the passage from his judgment in Nea Karteria that I have cited  The issue may be confined to what was said or done in a single transaction or it may be more complex than that and extend over a series of connected events or transactions  In each case the question for the court is whether the matters in issue and the document or documents in respect of which partial disclosure has been made are respectively severable so that the partially disclosed material clearly does not bear on matters in issue in respect of which material is withheld  The more confined the issue  for example as to the content of a single document or conversation  the more difficult it is likely to be to withhold  by severance  part of the document or other documents relevant to the document or conversation  In Fulham Leisure Holdings Ltd v Nicholson Graham   Jones     All ER     Fulham    at     Mann J suggested that it was helpful to approach the application of the test stated in Nea Karteria in three steps  first  identify the transaction in respect of which the disclosure has been made  secondly  ascertain from the nature of the disclosure or other evidence whether the transaction is wider than an advice given on a single occasion  if so  the whole of the wider transaction must be disclosed  and thirdly  the disclosure of the whole transaction may make it plain that further disclosure is necessary to avoid unfairness or misunderstanding of what has been disclosed  Mann J added at     that once the transaction has been identified the cases show that the whole of the material relevant to that transaction must be disclosed  It is not open to a waiving party to say that the transaction is simply what the party has chosen to disclose  the court will determine objectively what the real transaction is so that the scope of the waiver can be determined  His Lordship also said that the application of these principles will be very fact sensitive and will vary from case to case  at     consideredR v Secretary of State for Transport  Ex parte Factortame     Admin LR  In R v Secretary of State for Transport  Ex parte Factortame     Admin LR   at   Auld LJ made the following observations concerning

Factortame at     and Fulham at     and      Having regard to the form of the legal advice disclosed by AWB  the relevant legal exercise or transaction encompassed a review of original documents and witness interviews  as well as summaries  chronologies or other analytical documents prepared by the lawyers  with a view to determining whether there was any improper or wrongful conduct by AWB  Material of this kind underpinned or influenced the legal advice which AWB has chosen to disclose  and it is not severable from that advice appliedFulham Leisure Holdings Ltd v Nicholson Graham   Jones     All ER  In Fulham Leisure Holdings Ltd v Nicholson Graham   Jones     All ER     Fulham    at     Mann J suggested that it was helpful to approach the application of the test stated in Nea

from case to case  at      Hargreaves  memorandum of   June   makes it quite clear that his statements to the Australian Government were based upon all of the legal advice AWB had obtained  and not simply the advice it had obtained from Mr Tracey QC  It cannot be disputed that Hargreaves disclosed the substance of the legal advice which Blakes provided to AWB s board on   May    AWB has already formed that view and acted on it by producing Blakes  power point presentation to the Commission  But in my view the consequence of Hargreaves  disclosures cannot be confined to Blakes  advice of   May   and Mr Tracey QC s advices  Through the remainder of   and until Hargreaves had his last meeting with Ms Carayanides in the period between   June   and September   Hargreaves met with Australian Government representatives several times and continued to make assertions that AWB s independent legal review had not identified any wrongdoing by AWB  The evidence shows that Blakes and Minters continued the legal review in   and   and provided ongoing legal advice to AWB  It is not open to a waiving party to say that the disclosures relate simply to one advice and not others  or that the relevant transaction is simply what the party has chosen to disclose  the Court will determine objectively what has been disclosed  see Fulham at      Hargreaves  memorandum of   June   makes it plain that he deliberately deployed AWB s legal advice in his dealings with the Australian Government  He did so as part of AWB s strategy to secure the continued support of the Federal Government  both generally and in relation to AWB s dealings with the IIC and the United States Government  Hargreaves also deployed the advice in pursuit of the objectives that he set out in his memorandum  they included protecting and defending the reputation of AWB both within Australia and overseas  and minimising any attack by US wheat interests on AWB s position as the exclusive manager of wheat exports from Australia  Given these strategic objectives  it was important for AWB to disclose  indeed to stress  that it had conducted an extensive independent legal review which had found no evidence of any wrongdoing by AWB in connection with its exports of wheat to Iraq  By disclosing its legal advice to secure these objectives  AWB assumed the risk that it would be held to have waived legal professional privilege in connection with legal advices it obtained in the course of the legal review  Having regard to the legal principles governing waiver  I consider that any legal advice that AWB obtained from Blakes or Minters prior to Hargreaves  last meeting with Ms Carayanides on any of the subject matters  or relating to any of the issues  described at   above  has been waived by reason of the disclosures made by Hargreaves  Those subject matters and issues are wide enough to encompass the Tigris transaction and the iron filings claim  If AWB obtained legal advice during this period on those subject matters  or relating to those issues  from persons other than Blakes or Minters such as ABL  Mr Tracey QC or others  that advice has also been waived by Hargreaves  disclosures  Much the same answer follows if one asks what was the legal exercise or transaction that gave rise to the disclosed legal advice  see Factortame at     and Fulham at     and      Having regard to the form of the legal advice disclosed by AWB  the relevant legal exercise or transaction encompassed a review of original documents and witness interviews  as well as summaries  chronologies or other analytical documents prepared by the lawyers  with a view to determining whether there was any improper or wrongful conduct by AWB  Material of this kind underpinned or influenced the legal advice

were held to be  sufficiently iniquitous for public policy  to require those communications to be discoverable  Schiemann LJ  with whom Aldous and Butler Sloss LJJ agreed  stated at       that view be correct  then it matters not whether either the client or the solicitor shared that view  They may well have thought that the transactions would not fall to be set aside     either because they thought that the transactions were not at an undervalue or because they thought that the court would not find that the purpose of the transactions was to prejudice the bank  But if this is what they thought then there is a strong prima facie case that they were wrong  Public policy does not require the communications of those who misapprehend the law to be privileged in circumstances where no privilege attaches to those who correctly understand the situation  citedR v Bell  Ex parte Lees   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlWhere a client is engaged in

that it has some foundation in fact   The High Court in Propend applied this test  at   per Brennan CJ  at   per Dawson J    per Toohey J    per Gaudron J    per McHugh J  and   per Kirby J  It is not necessary to prove an improper purpose on the balance of probabilities  The  prima facie  test arguably reflects the fact that issues of legal professional privilege are usually dealt with in the interlocutory stages of a proceeding  but the authorities have not departed from that formulation where a declaration is sought in relation to privilege issues  Butler   Propend  Beazley   It must also be established  on the same prima facie basis  that the communication which is the subject of the claim for privilege was made in furtherance of  or as a step preparatory to  the commission of the fraud or wrongdoing  In Butler  Goff J found at   that a letter written by the plaintiff s lawyer which volunteered a warning that the plaintiff may incur serious consequences if he did not take care was not shown to be  in preparation for or in furtherance of or as part of any criminal designs on the part of the plaintiff  see also Zemanek v Commonwealth Bank of Australia  unreported  Federal Court  Hill J    October    The planned payments of the iron filings claim were never carried into effect because the invasion of Iraq intervened  Scales gave evidence to the Commission that the iron filings money has never been paid and remains in AWBI s accounts  However  the fact that the payments were never made to the GBI will not prevent the application of the fraud exception so long as there is sufficient evidence that the communications were in furtherance of  or preparatory to  the commission of the fraud or impropriety in the broad sense described above  see Butler  and Clements at     approvedO Rourke v Darbishire   AC  AWB placed particular reliance on Dawson J s formulation of the scope of legal advice privilege in Waterford v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at       legal professional privilege relied upon in this case is that which attaches to communications between a legal adviser and his client for the purpose of giving or receiving legal advice and to documents recording those communications or containing information for the purpose of enabling the advice to be given  In order to attract that privilege  the communications must be confidential and the legal adviser must be acting in his professional capacity  see Minet v Morgan   Wheeler v Le Marchant   Smith v Daniell   Bullivant v Attorney General  Vict     Jones v Great Central Railway Co   O Rourke v Darbishire        There is nothing controversial about this formulation of the principle  For the principle to apply  there must be more than a mere assertion or allegation of fraud or impropriety  Bullivant at     and      In Propend at   Brennan CJ expressed the test as being one of  reasonable grounds for believing  that the relevant communication was for an improper purpose  The requirement has also been described as one of a  prima facie case  Butler v Board of Trade     Ch     Butler    at   cf Baker v Evans     ALR   at    In Kearney at   Gibbs CJ approved the test formulated in O Rourke v Darbishire   AC   at   namely that  there must be something to give colour to the charge   the statement must be made in clear and definite terms  and there must further be some prima facie evidence that it has some foundation in fact   The High Court in Propend applied this test  at   per Brennan CJ  at   per Dawson J    per Toohey J    per Gaudron J    per McHugh J  and   per Kirby J  The evidence before me establishes to the requisite prima facie standard that the price in contracts A  and A  was inflated to cover both the amount of the iron filings claim and the repayment by GBI of the debt which it owed to Tigris  A surcharge of US    pmt was added to each contract in respect of the Tigris debt  as shown by an email from Nigel Edmonds Wilson to Scales and others at AWB dated   December    The same email shows that in each contract the inland transportation fee was set at US    pmt  At the Commission  Mr Geary of AWB gave evidence that the prices in these two contracts were inflated to cover a component for the Tigris debt and a component for the US  million iron filings rebate  He also said that the United Nations was not advised at any stage that the prices for wheat in these two contracts had been inflated in this way so as to cover the Tigris debt and the iron filings claim  To adopt the words of Viscount Finlay in O Rourke   the evidence gives ample  colour to the charge  that the prices in these two contracts were falsely misrepresented  The evidence shows that the prices in the two wheat contracts were inflated as a means of extracting money from the United Nations  escrow account  Having regard to the terms of the memorandum of   February   there are reasonable grounds for believing that  having extracted approximately US  million from the escrow account to meet the iron filings claim  AWB planned to pay that money in instalments to GBI via the mechanism of inland transportation fees  The material before me  including Whitwell s email of   November   and his memorandum of   February   indicates clearly that AWB knew that paying inland transportation fees to Alia was a means of making payments to the Iraqi Government  This plan was concealed from the United Nations citedBriginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn my view  the evidence establishes a more than adequate prima facie case that AWB knowingly and deliberately disguised the true nature of the prices in contracts A  and A   If it be relevant  I also consider that the evidence establishes the foregoing matters on the balance of probabilities and to a level of satisfaction commensurate with the seriousness of the allegation  see Briginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR   at   per Dixon J  No question arises here of evidence which would not be admissible in a final hearing  cf Propend   AWB argued that there was no evidence that the transaction furthered any particular fraud  iniquity or illegality  It submitted that it is common ground that the United Nations  resolutions were not in terms incorporated into Australian law  AWB submitted that  consequently  the fraud exception is not available to take the documents out of the operation of the doctrine of legal professional privilege  This narrow approach is at odds with the authorities that stress the wide range of fraudulent or iniquitous activities that fall within the principle  I have inspected the six documents that were said to relate to the iron filings claim  My inspection of AWB s documents revealed a further four documents that fall within this category and are still the subject of a privilege claim  I am satisfied that these   documents are not privileged  The documents were  prima facie  brought into existence in furtherance of an improper and dishonest purpose  viz inflating the prices of contracts A  and A  so as to extract payments out of the United Nations  escrow account that would then be utilised  in part  to satisfy a compensation claim by GBI  Prima facie  the evidence establishes that the transaction was deliberately and dishonestly structured by AWB so as to misrepresent the true nature and purpose of the trucking fees and to work a trickery on the United Nations  It would be contrary to public policy for the privilege to enure in communications of this kind
