Bond v Barry   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAdvanced Hair Studio Pty Ltd v TVW Enterprises Ltd     FCR   Section  A provides an exemption from the application of s    That is to say  conduct which would otherwise contravene s   does not do so if it is conduct to which s  A applies  The section provides no exemption for a media organisation which is an accessory to a contravention which is not covered by s  A  So  if a news organisation aids  abets or induces somebody who is not covered by s  A to make statements in trade or commerce which are misleading or deceptive and contravene s   or one of the State Fair Trading Acts   then the news organisation may be  involved in  that contravention within the meaning of s  B of the TPA or its equivalent under the relevant Fair Trading Act   That is not to say that a newspaper or other media outlet would be held liable simply for reporting the fact of a statement by a third party which is of itself misleading or deceptive  It is not necessary to consider the conditions of accessorial liability in such a case because that is not the case now before the Court  The proposition remains that there is no protection in s  A or its Fair Trading Act equivalents against accessorial liability for misleading or deceptive conduct  Advanced Hair Studio Pty Ltd v TVW Enterprises Ltd     FCR     Section  A exempts from the application of s    a prescribed publication of matter by a prescribed information provider   The party claiming the exemption must be a prescribed information provider  This means a person  who carries on a business of providing information   The term includes but is not limited to licence holders under the Broadcasting Services Act   or who provide broadcasting services under a class licence under that Act  The word  information  is not defined  Its ordinary meaning relevantly includes  knowledge or facts communicated about a particular subject  event etc

Newspapers Ltd     ALR   citedCarlovers Carwash Ltd v Sahathevan   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  The term  freelance journalist  is not explained in the statement of claim  It may be taken to include a person who writes articles for publication in media outlets on the basis that he or she will be paid for articles so published by the relevant media organisation  A freelance journalist is necessarily a person working on his or her own account and not as an employee of a particular media organisation  A person who carries on business as a freelance journalist is plainly within the class of persons described in s  A as a  prescribed information provider  see Carlovers Carwash Ltd v Sahathevan   NSWSC   at    Levine J    In written submissions filed on behalf of Mr Bond and Lesotho Diamond it was argued that  chequebook journalism  is not covered by the s  A exemption   Chequebook journalism  is not a term of any statutory significance  It is generally used to describe the practice of media organisations paying non journalists who happen to have undergone particular experiences to tell the story of their experiences exclusively to the paying organisation for publication by it  So a person who has been involved in some notorious or tragic event or scandal may make himself or herself available  for a fee  to be interviewed exclusively by a particular media organisation who may then publish the interview or a story based upon it  It can be said that selling the story amounts to providing information  That does not however constitute  carrying on the business of providing information   Payment to freelance journalists cannot be equated with the practice of chequebook journalism   The exemption under s  A applies only to a  prescribed publication of matter   That is a publication by the prescribed information provider  in the course of carrying on a business of providing information   There is a question whether the transmission by a freelance journalist to a media outlet of an article for publication itself constitutes publication   Where more than one construction is open on the statute  that construction should be adopted which is consistent with its purpose  The purpose of s  A was clearly stated in the Second Reading Speech  To exclude from the exemption the supply of information by freelance journalists to media organisations is to partially defeat that purpose  The communication of news articles to media organisations by freelance journalists is so plainly within the intended purpose of the section that a construction covering it should be adopted provided that construction is open  In my opinion  as stated above  such communication is within the natural and ordinary meaning of publication as publication to the world at large  And even if transmission of an article by a freelance journalist to the editor of a media organisation were to be construed as merely one to one communication  the concept of such communication as publication is familiar in the area of defamation law  In Webb v Bloch   HCA         CLR   Isaacs J said  at       To publish a libel is to convey

fundamental expressions meaning making available to the public  and that  it would take a great deal of contextual constraint to force them into a narrower and special meaning  Infabrics Ltd v Jaytex Ltd     All ER   at    It was argued that  because s  A exempts those who fall within it from  amongst other things  the consequences of misleading or deceptive conduct  there is no reason why the Court should adopt an expansive interpretation of the word  publication   It should be interpreted in accordance with its ordinary natural meaning  In my opinion  however  the ordinary and natural
