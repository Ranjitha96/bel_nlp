    FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlTracey J ordered that Mr Siminton s application be dismissed with costs on   October    His Honour gave reasons for that decision in the form of a  ruling  delivered on that same day  Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v David Robert Siminton  No     FCA    He noted that a number of the matters raised by Mr Siminton had been agitated before another judge of this Court  Merkel J  earlier this year  Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton  No     FCA    However  Tracey J also noted that Mr Siminton had raised what his Honour described as a  novel complaint  namely that the proceeding had been brought unconstitutionally because it was said to provide for the acquisition of Mr Siminton s property by APRA  or the Commonwealth  without just terms  Tracey J set out his reasons for dismissing Mr Siminton s application at     of his ruling  He rejected the contention that the various interlocutory processes engaged in by APRA constituted evidence of a collateral purpose which rendered the proceeding an abuse of process  He noted that the constitutional argument had not been raised in Mr Siminton s defence to the proceeding  He declined to deal with the merits of that argument  saying simply that if it had any substance  it could be raised at the trial  Finally  his Honour rejected a submission that there was  no evidence  to support the allegations made by APRA  noting that this same claim had been made before Merkel J  and failed  When it was said by Mr Siminton that APRA had not  in the intervening period  supplied evidence to fill the void that allegedly existed in its case  namely  the lack of any evidence to demonstrate that Mr Siminton had carried on a  banking business  as defined in s   of the Banking Act    Cth  his Honour replied that APRA was not under any obligation to supply such evidence  The time for it to be supplied would be when the matter was being readied for trial  If it turned out that there was no evidence to support APRA s claims  Mr Siminton could then move for summary judgment  I have been provided with a draft notice of appeal upon which Mr Siminton proposes to rely if leave to appeal is granted  It raises what Tracey J described as the  no evidence  ground  However  it also contends that his Honour erred in construing s  A of the Banking Act   and  in addition  raises the s  xxxi  constitutional ground  It was submitted by Mr Sharp  who appeared on behalf of Mr Siminton this morning before me  that leave to appeal should be granted because Tracey J had erred in rejecting the  no evidence  ground  Mr Sharp referred to a  concession  by counsel for APRA before Sundberg J  who granted the original interlocutory injunction in this matter in December   that APRA at that time had no evidence of any actual lending by Mr Siminton s  bank  but only evidence of an intention to lend in the future  It was submitted that there could not be a contravention of s   of the Banking Act without both receipt of depositors  money  and lending of that money  In response  Mr Hibble  on behalf of APRA  submitted that APRA had evidence of lending  and would produce that evidence in accordance with any timetable laid down by Tracey J  He submitted that Mr Sharp s application was premature  and that whatever may have been said to Sundberg J  in the course of an urgent application for interlocutory relief  should not be regarded as APRA s actual position in the primary proceeding  In my view  Tracey J s conclusion that this issue should await the filing of evidence by APRA was not attended with sufficient doubt to warrant the grant of leave to appeal  Indeed  I consider that conclusion to be plainly correct  APRA has pleaded  in paragraph  a  of its Statement of Claim  that between January   and  the present  Mr Siminton  has loaned money to members of the public  as well as pleading in paragraph  b  that he had  stated an intention to loan money to members of the public   If APRA cannot produce evidence to support the allegation contained in paragraph  a  that may mean that its claim against Mr Siminton for having contravened s   of the Banking Act will fail  and that point can be addressed by way of an application for summary judgment  However  at this stage  it would be quite wrong to stay or dismiss this proceeding simply because APRA has not yet produced this evidence  Mr Sharp submitted that APRA had been under a duty not to plead facts for which there was no evidence available  That states the principle too narrowly  The duty is not to allege facts unless there is a proper basis for making that allegation  A genuine belief  on reasonable grounds  that admissible evidence will be forthcoming to support an allegation can be sufficient to justify its being made  I am not persuaded that there is an adequate basis for inferring some impropriety on the part of APRA in its early pleading in this matter  Mr Sharp s submission regarding the proper construction of s  A   and particularly the term  damages  in s  A    seems to me to be without merit  I see no reason why statutory damages of the kind contemplated in that provision should not encompass restitution of monies paid by depositors who were misled by Mr Siminton s use of the term  bank  in connection with his business  That is not to say that any such depositors were misled  It may be  as Mr Sharp submitted  that they all went into this venture with their eyes entirely wide open  If that is so  the assurances given by APRA regarding the ultimate disposition of the funds presently frozen provide adequate safeguard for Mr Siminton s interests  as well as those of participating depositors  Mr Sharp s constitutional argument may  or may not  have merit  I agree with Tracey J that the time for that argument to be raised is after the affidavits have been filed  and all interlocutory processes have been completed  There should be a proper defence drawn  relying upon s  xxxi  and proper opportunity for submissions  At this stage  I am not persuaded that Tracey J s approach to this issue was attended with any error  Accordingly  I would not grant leave to appeal on this point  Nor would I grant leave to appeal upon the basis of the matters raised by an offer made by Mr Siminton to settle the proceeding on terms set out in a letter dated   August    APRA s rejection of that offer in no way renders the primary proceeding an abuse of process  It follows that I would refuse leave to appeal from Order   of the Orders made by Tracey J on   October   dismissing Mr Siminton s notice of motion dated   September    I should add that Mr Sharp also sought to agitate the correctness  or otherwise of a further order made by Tracey J on   October   requiring Mr Siminton to report to the Nunawading Police Station each Thursday between   am and   pm commencing on   October    That order was not the subject of the formal application for leave to appeal before me today  However  APRA did not object to my dealing with Mr Sharp s challenge to that order  Indeed  APRA indicated that it did not object to my vacating the order entirely  having regard to the fact that Mr Siminton presently is not facing any charge of contempt  and is not in immediate danger of imprisonment  In those circumstances  I am prepared to vacate that order  and will do so    I certify that the preceding fourteen   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Weinberg
