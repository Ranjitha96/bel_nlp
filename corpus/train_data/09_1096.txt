Parkin v O Sullivan   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedAlister v The Queen     CLR  In Commonwealth v Northern Land Council   HCA         CLR     a public interest immunity case about documents recording cabinet deliberations  the Court said at       There was  therefore  no call for Jenkinson J to order that the documents be produced for inspection  But we would add that  even if there had been  the procedure of ordering production of documents for inspection by the legal representatives of one of the parties  even upon a restricted basis  before the claim for immunity had been decided by the court  was open to serious question  Whatever the safeguards  it represents an encroachment upon the confidentiality claimed for the documents  And in this case  public interest in their immunity from disclosure was of the highest order  If inspection of documents is necessary to determine the question of immunity  and in this case it was not  then it ought to be carried out by the court before ordering production for inspection by a party  No doubt this may in some cases cast a heavy burden on the court  but it is unavoidable if confidentiality is to be maintained until a claim for immunity is determined       See also Alister v The Queen     CLR   at   and Gypsy Jokers Inc v Commissioner of Police  WA    HCA         CLR   at   and   per Crennan J  Northern Land Council and Alister concerned inspection by the court of the documents over which privilege was claimed  In Gypsy Jokers Crennan J spoke more broadly of  information in documents   certain material relied on for determination of a proceeding  and  confidential material before a court  which was not revealed to a party seeking it  In The Queen v Bebic  unreported    May   the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales dealt specifically with the disclosure of the contents of an affidavit tendered in support of a public interest immunity claim  There Samuels JA  Nagle CJ at CL and Cantor J said at       Mr Mason tendered an affidavit in support of his claim for privilege  He submitted  however  that the affidavit should not be placed on the file  that is to say that it should be read only by the Court and not disclosed to the party calling  on the footing that the contents of the affidavit would or might themselves compromise the claims for privilege          We had and still have some doubts about the propriety of restricting the affidavit in the way proposed  However  it may well be that that course is  in certain cases  of which this is one  no more than a logical extension of the established practice of the Courts inspecting the allegedly privileged documents itself       Later at   after saying that the Court had read both documents in question and the affidavit in support of the claim for privilege  their Honours said      It seems to us that granted that it is now commonplace for judges to make a private inspection of documents in order to resolve a claim for privilege      it follows that in a proper case the judge may similarly keep to himself the affidavit by which the claim is supported       The Court then ordered that the affidavit remain sealed up with the papers on the ground that to disclose its contents might prejudice the claim for privilege  I have referred in connection with the respondent s affidavit to the great importance that is attached to the respondent s opinion as to the damage to national security incident upon disclosure  Obviously that is also the case in relation to the disclosure of the documents over which privilege is claimed  I have summarised the respondent s reasons for his opinion about the possible effects of disclosure of the documents in question  This is all derived from the open parts of his affidavit  The Final Appreciations and related briefing notes set out the reasoning process that underlies the making of security assessments  which are the key mechanism by which ASIO advises government that particular individuals pose a threat to national security  If documents falling within this class were required to be produced  ASIO would be giving information about its knowledge  assessments and methodology to the very people to whom it is most important that national security information is not disclosed  cf Alister   CLR at     per Brennan J  As the respondent has deposed  the relevant class is  one of the classes of documents held by ASIO that require the greatest level of protection  first  because of the inherent sensitivity of the information that is routinely contained in such documents  and second  because of the detrimental consequences in terms of the quality of decision making that would be likely to follow if ASIO officers were forced to omit particular kinds of information from Final Appreciations and related briefing notes due to the risk that those documents will become available to persons the subject of security assessments  The applicants contended that the respondent was not able to make a class claim  It was said that he seeks to describe as a class claim documents which he considers constitutes a Final Appreciation and documents related thereto  That description  they say  does not constitute an identifiable class  The table in the affidavit  set out at   refers to an internal email  an internal minute and a briefing note  It does not refer to any Final Appreciation  By way of contrast  the applicants assert that Cabinet documents constitute a clear class claim  Here they say the so called class claim involves the respondent asserting for himself that particular documents constitute Final Appreciations  I do not think that is a fair description of the respondent s claim  The presently relevant parts of his affidavit are as follows   a  shortly after identifying the documents in the table at   he describes them on a class basis as  paradigm examples of documents that ASIO should not be required to disclose save in exceptional circumstances   b  the results of complex security assessments are usually contained in a Final Appreciation document  though it may not be headed in that way   c  the Final Appreciation ordinarily takes the form of an ASIO minute   d  when the investigative branch assesses an individual to be a threat to Australia s national security  the respondent is advised  usually by a DGBN   e  often both a DGBN and a Final Appreciation are provided to the respondent for decision   f  it is the document on which a security assessment is based  being the Final Appreciation  however that document is headed  and any associated DGBN that cannot be disclosed   g  the class claim advanced concerns the class of documents shortly described as  Final Appreciation documents and related briefing notes   h  documents in this class invariably contain specific detail as to why persons are assessed as a risk to national security  and specific details of intelligence sources and methods   i  the respondent has examined the ASIO documents  namely those in the table  the class claim  and the contents claim documents  and   j  the disclosure of the documents in  i

should be upheld  In Church of Scientology v Woodward   HCA         CLR   at   Brennan J said      Discovery would not be given against the Director General  of Security  save in a most exceptional case  The secrecy of the work of an intelligence organization which is to counter espionage  sabotage  etc  is essential to national security  and the public interest in national security will seldom yield to the public interest in the administration of civil justice                 the veil of secrecy is not absolutely impenetrable     But the veil is not penetrated merely by a plaintiff s deposition that he is not a security risk  That  after all  may be the very matter which is under investigation       See also Leghaei v Director General of Security   FCAFC at   and R v Khazaal   NSWSC at      In seeking to establish an exceptional case the applicants  point out that they may be unable to make out their cases if the claim to immunity is upheld  The authorities establish that this consequence of the outcome of the process of balancing public interest immunity against the public interest  upon which the applicants rely  of having conventional access to evidentiary material  is not exceptional  Thus in the Scientology case at     Brennan J referred to the obstacles in a plaintiff s path in judicial review proceedings against the Director General arising out of the restrictions imposed upon discovery in aid of proving what is and is not relevant to security  In the same case at   Mason J noted that a successful claim for privilege may exclude from consideration the very material on which a plaintiff hopes to base his argument  These observations of Mason J were quoted with approval by Gummow  Hayne  Heydon and Keifel JJ in Gypsy Jokers Inc   CLR at    In that case at   Gleeson CJ said that the consequence of success of a claim for public interest immunity against disclosure of information is that the information is not available as evidence to be taken into account in deciding the outcome of judicial review proceedings  The Court would not be able to have regard to some  or perhaps any  of the information on which a public official s belief was based appliedCommonwealth v Northern Land Council   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn Commonwealth v Northern Land Council   HCA         CLR     a public interest

affidavit remain sealed up with the papers on the ground that to disclose its contents might prejudice the claim for privilege  I was uncertain about the status of the  ASIO internal email dated   September    re  Parkin  and called for the documents in order to determine whether it fell within the class claimed  I did this in reliance on what had been said in Northern Land Council   CLR at       In many so called  class  cases a court may find it necessary to consider a document  inspecting it if necessary  in order to determine whether it does in truth fall into a class which attracts immunity  Having inspected the documents  my inference as to the Internal Minutes and Briefing Notes was confirmed  Each Internal Minute fits the description given by the respondent of a Final Appreciation  Each Briefing Note accords with his description of a DGBN  The  ASIO internal email dated   September    re  Parkin  is a covering note transmitting the Internal Minute to the respondent  It contains a brief summary of the Internal Minute  It fits the respondent s description recorded at   that  Final Appreciation documents  and summaries thereof   are documents the disclosure of which is very likely to damage Australia s national security   emphasis added   On the basis of the material in the respondent s affidavit  aided by my inspection of the documents  it is clear to me that the matters relied on by the applicants do not outweigh the public interest identified by the respondent  The contrast asserted by the applicants between Cabinet documents  a clear class claim  and the respondent s description here  see   is not helpful  That is because of the range of documents  with different levels of Cabinet connection  that may fall within the description but not necessarily qualify for immunity  At the top of the chain will be the Cabinet minutes considered in Northern Land Council   HCA       CLR    Lower down will be documents and communications between a Minster and the head of department relating to cabinet proceedings and material prepared for cabinet  Further down the chain are documents relating to the formation of government policy at a high level  Then will come other documents concerned with policy making including minutes by junior officials and correspondence with outside bodies  See S ankey v Whitlam   HCA         CLR   at    In

htmlHaving carefully studied the redacted parts of the respondent s affidavit I have concluded that they should not be made available to the applicants  legal advisers  even on the giving of

officer  See for example Leghaei v Director General of Security   FCAFC   at            Although usually expressed in connection with the inspection of protected documents themselves  those observations apply also to an affidavit  such as that sworn in this case  which supplies the reasons for the claim to privilege  In the open part of his affidavit the respondent says that the disclosure of the redacted portions of his affidavit would be likely to prejudice national security  In the balance of the affidavit  in particular the redacted parts  he explains the basis for his opinion  Having read those parts  I am satisfied that the opinion is soundly based  Accordingly  the respondent may rely on his affidavit in support of his public interest claim without providing to
