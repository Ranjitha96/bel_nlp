provides that beverages for human consumption are food  There is a definition of the term  beverage  in s     saying that it  includes water   A more helpful description of the word is to be found in Bristol Myers Co Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   where Lockhart J described a beverage as  a drink of any kind  and  any liquid which is swallowed to quench thirst or for nourishment  and said that  a beverage is consumed either hot or cold and is normally taken to quench the person s thirst or for stimulation or as an accompaniment to solid foods either at meal times

products are beverages of a kind specified in the third column of the Table in cl   of Sch   to the GST Act  It is again common ground that Edenvale Chardonnay  Edenvale Shiraz and Edenvale Rose need

www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlSuch a legislative purpose is also discernable both from the circumstances in which the amendments arose  and the context in which Items   and   appear in the Table  This was recognised by Gzell J in P   N at     There is a lot to be said for the submission of the Commissioner that when the compromise was made for a qualified exemption for food to ensure the passage of legislation  as Sundberg J points out Cascade Brewery Co Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR   at     the legislature seems to have drawn the line between exempt and non exempt food supplies in favour of food that is fresh  natural or unprocessed  For example  the beverages that are not included in the table to cl   of Sch   of the GST Act and are therefore not GST free  include soft drinks and cordials  flavoured milk  Item   and flavoured soy milk and rice milk  Item    The only carbonated beverages that are GST free are those satisfying Item   and water  Item   is GST free only if it is non carbonated and without any other additives    First Issue  Whether the Edenvale products consist wholly  Item   or at least   by volume  Item   of the juices of fruits  The phrase  juices of fruits Reference was made to Cascade Brewery Company Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA       FCR   where Sundberg J said at     The reason for the qualified exemption of food from GST is well known  and was common ground  It was the political compromise reached in order that the GST scheme might become law  The distinction drawn in Totalizator between an exemption directed at a particular person or body and one that encourages a particular activity is applicable here  It is true  as Cascade says  that item   is not directed at a particular person or body  But nor is it concerned to encourage any particular activity  It is not intended to encourage the production of beverages or ingredients of any kind  It was the result of a political deal that gave partial exemption to food  In the case of the beverage component of food  the result was that the beverage or an ingredient therefore would be exempt if it was of a kind marketed principally as food for infants or invalids  In accordance with Totalizator   there is no occasion to approach the meaning of  infant  or  invalids  in any manner other than by according the words their ordinary meaning  According to the Commissioner  the applicant is not correct in submitting that the expressions  juices of fruits  is an anachronism resulting from the history of the sales tax legislation and that the meaning intended to be conveyed by the draftsman by the use of that expression was the same as  fruit juice   It follows  the Commissioner argued  that  juices of fruits  and  fruit juice  are not synonymous and any purported trade meaning as to  fruit juice  in the beverage industry  being the definition in the Foods Standard Code   has no relevance to the interpretation of the expression  juices of fruits   In any event  the Commissioner submitted  the definition of  fruit juice  in the Food Standards Code could not have had significance in construing the expression  juices of fruits  in circumstances where that expression was used in taxing legislation many years before the Food Standards Code was introduced  The expression  juices of Australian fruits  had been a term used in the wholesale sales tax since the  s and  s  I have come to the conclusion  not without some hesitation  that the Commissioner s approach is to be preferred because it better promotes the legislative purpose of the GST Act in relation to food   namely  that the exemption or GST free status is a qualified one where  as Sundberg J pointed out in Cascade Brewery   the legislature seems to have drawn the line between exempt and non exempt food supplies in favour of food that is fresh  natural or unprocessed  The fact that one can readily point to some specific exclusions to this line in the GST Act does not reduce or mitigate against its force as an overall observation or conclusion  For these reasons  I am of the view that the Edenvale products are not non alcoholic beverages  While their respective alcohol content by volume is low  it owes its existence to an infused process of fermentation rather than a naturally occurring one  The application must be dismissed referred toCIC Insurances Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd     CLR  It is the same with the GST Act  As Hill J  with whom Stone and Allsop JJ agreed  said in H P Mercantile Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC         FCR   at       It is clear  both having regard to the modern principles of interpretation as enunciated by the High Court in cases such as CIC Insurance Limited v Bankstown Football Club Ltd     CLR   and s  AA of the Acts Interpretation Act    Cth  that the Court will prefer an interpretation of a statute which would give effect to the legislative purpose  as opposed to one that would not  This requires the Court to identify that purpose  both by reference to the language of the statute itself and also any extrinsic material which the Court is authorised to take into account  He submitted that in such circumstances a construction of the legislation that promotes the purpose of the GST Act is to be preferred to one which would not promote the purpose  see s  AA of the Acts Interpretation Act    Cth  CIC Insurances Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd     CLR    He submitted that confining non alcoholic beverages to those beverages which do not acquire their alcohol content through human intervention  i e   by using yeast to cause or accelerate fermentation  and contain an amount of alcohol by volume which is considered insignificant  best promotes the legislative purpose of the GST Act in respect of food namely  that GST free status is confined to  basic  food  As the alcoholic content of the applicant s Edenvale products arises through human intervention those products are not  according to the Commissioner  non alcoholic even though the level of that content may be low after the de alcoholisation process has taken place  By reference to the same principle of construction  the applicant contended that a non alcoholic beverage meant a beverage other than an alcoholic beverage  this gives meaning and operation to Items   and   and is therefore to be preferred referred toCollector of Customs v Agfa Gevaert Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlHis Honour observed at   that it was common ground that the phrase  juices of fruits  does not have a trade meaning  At   he referred to what was said by a Full Court of this Court in Zeroz Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation     ATR   at    if there is no trade usage then a fortiori the expression must be used in its ordinary English sense   But P   N in that case  like the applicant in this case  made a number of submissions which  at the risk of doing the applicant a disservice  went something like this    While the phrase  juices of fruits  does not have a trade meaning  the phrase is synonymous with  fruit juice  and that term had a trade meaning as defined in the Food Standards Code     The Food Standards Code is a reference to the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code as defined in the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act    Cth   The Food Standards Code   standard       with respect to fruit juice and vegetable juice  defined fruit juice or vegetable juice as the liquid portion  with or without pulp  obtained from fruit or vegetables respectively and in the case of citrus fruit  other than lime  the endocarp only of the fruit and included products that had been concentrated and later reconstituted with water to a concentration consistent with that of the undiluted juice from which it had been made  At   and   his Honour observed that it was common ground that the fruit drinks supplied by P   N met the Food Standards Code requirements  It was also common ground that P   N fruit drinks contained non fruit based additives  vitamins and minerals or used processing aids within the limits permitted by the Food Standards Code   The evidence was that the fruit drinks contained       fruit juice and       additives and processing aids not directly derived from fruit     In substituting a trade meaning of  fruit juice  for  juices of fruits  that has no trade meaning  reliance was placed on Collector of Customs v Agfa Gevaert Ltd   HCA         CLR   where the phrase  silver dye bleach reversal process  in a tariff concession had no trade meaning but the words  silver dye bleach process  did  The High Court held that the Tribunal s construction of the composite phrase by reference to the trade meaning of the lesser phrase and the ordinary meaning of the word  reversal  involved no error of law  The submission  by parity of reasoning  was that in the Item   composite phrase  wholly of juices of fruits  the word  wholly  should be given its ordinary meaning and the words  juices of fruits   in both Items   and   should be given the trade meaning for  fruit juice      That having adopted the Foods Standards Code prior to the introduction of the GST Act  its concepts were well known to the Parliament and that it may be taken to have had regard to them in respect of a law dealing with the exemption of food  As to the reliance on Agfa Gevaert in substituting a trade meaning of  fruit juice  for  juices of fruits  his Honour said at     Agfa Gevaert is quite different from the instant circumstances  The composite phrase was not one that had an obvious ordinary meaning  Nor did the lesser phrase  In those circumstances  the lesser  phrase  aided the proper interpretation of the composite one  Here  the words that comprise the composite phrase are words of common parlance  even if they are oddly arranged  and there is not the same need to call in aid a trade meaning  As to the submission that Parliament may be taken to have adopted the Food Standards Code and its trade meaning of  fruit juice  in respect of a law dealing with the exemption of food  his Honour said at             Furthermore  the extrinsic materials do not suggest that parliament adopted a trade meaning in the Foods Standards Code   If it had  one would have expected it to have departed from the unusual  phrase   juices of fruits   The extrinsic material makes it clear  in my view  that parliament intended to bring within the scope of the amendments to the GST Act the exemptions or concessions in relation to food products under the existing sales tax legislation  Hence the adoption of the phraseology in Item          Parliament was invoking its past legislation rather than adopting a trade meaning of other words in an industry code that the past legislation preceded  The harking back to a phrase used in the sales tax legislation in   leads to the irresistible conclusion that parliament was carrying forward some of the exemptions and concessions with respect to food in the sales tax legislation and not attributing to the phrase any trade meaning of a different term in the Foods Standards Code   There was no logical reason for parliament  in introducing a new tax  to adopt a code intended to ensure that the public was protected from poorly prepared food  The   objects are clearly distinct  If parliament had intended to adopt the code  one would have expected a collocation such as   non alcoholic carbonated beverages produced wholly in accordance with the Foods Standards Code      ANALYSIS   Relevant Principles of Statutory ConstructionconsideredCommissioner of Taxation v Bargwanna   FCA  Recently  in Commissioner of Taxation v Bargwanna   FCA     June    in the course of considering whether a fund was applied for the purposes for which it was established within s     of the Income Tax Assessment Act    Cth  I said  at     It can be accepted that where Parliament has enacted legislation to encourage a particular activity  for example  legislation which gives particular concessions to the mining or petroleum industries  the legislation must be construed so as to promote Parliament s purpose and not so as to detract from that purpose  Totalizator Agency Board v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   at  A per Hill J  with whom Tamberlin J and Sundberg J agreed  Thus an exemption which exists for the purpose of encouraging  rewarding or protecting some class of activity is to be given a liberal rather than a narrow construction and application  see Commissioner of Taxation v Reynolds Australia Alumina Ltd     FCR   at   per Beaumont J and at     per Burchett J  Diethelm Manufacturing Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR   at   per French J  But in the case of a provision which confers an exemption upon a particular kind of body or fund which meets certain requirements  Parliament s purpose is not promoted by construing the provision in a manner favourable to the body or fund referred to in it  see TAB at  C per Hill J  Indeed  there is much to be said for the view that the privileged status of exemption from income tax on the income of a fund which aspires to that status demands strict adherence to the requirements that must be met before that status is conferred    consideredDeputy Commissioner of Taxation v Pepsi Cola Metropolitan Bottling Co Inc     FLR  Item   specifically Item  d ii  was the subject of further consideration by the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Pepsi Cola Metropolitan Bottling Co Inc     FLR   when it was in the following terms    Fruit juice products  namely      a  Concentrates for the making of non alcoholic beverages  being concentrates which consist of not less than   by volume of juices of Australian fruits     b  Cordials for the making of non alcoholic beverages  and preparations for use in the flavouring of foods  being cordials or preparations which consist of not less than   by volume of      i  juices of Australian fruits   ii  a mixture of concentrates and juices of Australian fruits and water  being a mixture of a strength not less than the natural strength of the juices   iii  juices of Australian fruits and a mixture of concentrates of juices of Australian fruits and water  being a mixture of a strength not less than the natural strength of the juices     c  Non alcoholic beverages consisting wholly of juices of Australian fruits or vegetables  including herbage     d  Non alcoholic carbonated beverages containing not less than   by volume of      i  juices of Australian fruits   ii  a mixture of concentrates of juices of Australian fruits and water  being a mixture of a strength not less than the natural strength of the juices   iii  juices of Australian fruits and a mixture of concentrates of juices of Australian fruits and water  being a mixture of a strength not less than the natural strength of the juices     Emphasis added   I have referred at some length to the Pepsi Cola case because of the reliance placed on it by counsel for the applicant for his submission  or the first alternative of it  that the Edenvale products consist of the requisite measures by volume of the juices of fruits at the point of supply notwithstanding the anterior fermentation and de alcoholisation processes  For reasons I will come to  reliance on the Pepsi Cola case for that submission  in my view  is flawed  Immediately before the commencement of the GST Act  Item   of the Table found expression in Item   of the Second Schedule to the E   C Act      non alcoholic carbonated beverages  if they consist wholly of juices of fruits or vegetables  and Item   of the Table found expression in Item   of the Second Schedule to the E   C Act  although the bar for the volume requirement of juices of fruits or vegetables was set much lower   non alcoholic non carbonated beverages  if they consist of at least   by volume of juices of fruits or vegetables   In both cases they were subject to   sales tax rather than being  as under the GST Act  tax free  The applicant relies on the decisions in Faulding and Pepsi Cola in support of its position  The decision in Pepsi Cola does not create any tension with such a conclusion because the item in question in that case used the word  containing  not  consisting  a distinction apparent to Macfarlan J in the extract from his judgment  at   reproduced at   above and the reason why  in that case  his Honour concluded that in using the word  containing  rather than  consisting   Parliament  was  only concerned to ensure that an Australian fruit juice in the prescribed quantity shall have been used in the carbonated beverage   at    An additional impediment for the applicant in the case of the carbonated Edenvale product is that Item   of the Table requires that it must consist  wholly  of juices of fruit and even in the applicant s case  it admitted that the product only consists of     by volume of juices of fruit  However  the applicant argues that the additional volume largely consists of rainwater added to the beverage as part of the reconstitution process and  accordingly  the rainwater should properly be regarded as part of the grape juice  Once an adjustment is made for the rainwater  and taken into account as being part of the juices of fruits  but see   below  the product consists of     by volume of juices of fruits  It is then suggested by the applicant that the de minimis rule should apply to the remainder consideredFederal Commissioner of Taxation v F H  Faulding   Co Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn Federal Commissioner of Taxation v F H Faulding   Co Limited   HCA         CLR     the High Court of Australia had occasion to consider Item   of  what was then  the First Schedule to the E   C Act  when it was in the following terms   Essences  concentrates and cordials  consisting wholly or principally of juices of Australian fruits  for the making of non alcoholic beverages  non alcoholic beverages consisting wholly of Australian fruits   It is important to an appreciation of what was said in the Full High Court and its relevance to this case  that the framework of the issues which came up to the Full Court be understood  It was not disputed that the liquids sold were cordials nor that they were cordials for the making of non alcoholic beverages or that they contained substantial quantities of juices of Australian fruits  They did not consist wholly of such juices  The only controversy was as to whether they consisted principally of juices of Australian fruits  In the present case  there is a real issue as to whether the beverage supplied consists of  juices of fruits   At first instance  Rich J held that the words  consisting     principally of juices of Australian fruits  referred to the characteristic feature of the cordial to what his Honour described as the element giving it its name and nature  its essential properties  On appeal to the Full Court  Latham CJ said  at       The difficulty which this view meets is found in the words  consisting of   The reference is not to the principal characteristic of the cordial considered as a cordial  but to the content of the cordial  In the phrase  consisting wholly or principally of juice of Australian fruits  the word  wholly  necessarily requires the application of a quantitative standard  The word  principally  must  in my opinion  be similarly construed  Words might have been used which would have given the exemption to any fruit juice cordial in which the whole or larger part of the fruit juice used was juice of Australian fruits  So also an exemption might have been given to all cordials in which any flavouring of Australian fruit juice was contained  Possibly some such provision would represent the result which Parliament intended to achieve  But the court cannot speculate upon such a matter  It must construe the words actually used  The word  consisting  refers to the physical components of the cordial  and the questions to be asked in determining whether the exemption is applicable are   Does this cordial consist wholly of juices of Australian fruits  In the present case the answer to this question must be  No    Does it consist principally of juices of Australian fruits  The answer to this question must also  in my opinion  be  No  because the words  consisting principally of  must be read as referring to quantity expressed in terms of either volume or weight of the substance of the cordial and cannot be read as referring to that constituent of the cordial  whatever its proportionate quantity  which gives to the cordial its distinctive flavour as a cordial  Paragraph  d  was added to Item   by Act No    of    Significantly  it uses the word  containing  not the words  consisting  or  consist of  as in paras  a   b  and  c   After referring to what was said by Latham CJ in Faulding in the extract reproduced at   above  Macfarlan J said  at     If  indeed  as the High Court in Faulding s case appears to have thought  the use of the word  consisting  means  constituents actually existing at the time of tax and physically identifiable by reference to the qualities prescribed for exemption  the word  containing  might be thought to have been intended to have a different meaning  Were it not so  then one might reasonably have expected that the word  consisting  would have been used again  This  indeed  was an argument submitted on behalf of the defendant  while learned counsel for the plaintiff distinctly accepted that his argument on this point meant that there existed an identity of meaning for the words  contain  and  consist   After referring to various dictionary definitions of the word  containing  to which he was taken by counsel for both parties  his Honour said  at       The word  containing  qualifies the words  non alcoholic carbonated beverage   In other words  the mixture which is afterwards described in par   ii  must be contained in the non alcoholic carbonated beverage and in the present case  the beverage being carbonated when it is in the bottle for sale by retail  the contents of that bottle must then contain the  mixture   It is therefore necessary to inquire what is contained in the bottle at that time              In my opinion all the circumstances lead to the conclusion that  subject to certain matters I will mention in a moment  Parliament is only concerned to insure that an Australian fruit juice in the prescribed quantity shall have been used in the carbonated beverage  In my opinion  the meaning of the word  contain  must be understood in this way  The applicant relies on the decisions in Faulding and Pepsi Cola in support of its position  The decision in Faulding is entirely consistent with the Commissioner s position  In Faulding   the majority  which included Latham CJ  concluded  in the context of Item   that the word  consisting  refers to a quantitative test in terms of the constituents actually existing at the time of supply and physically identifiable by reference to the qualities prescribed for exemption  Latham CJ said  at      T he words  consisting principally of  must be read as referring to quantity expressed in terms of either volume or weight of the substance of the cordial and cannot be read as referring to that constituent of its cordial  whatever its proportionate quantity  which gives to the cordial its distinctive flavour as a cordial  So too must the de alcoholised wine under consideration consist of at least    or wholly  for the carbonated Edenvale product  of  juices of fruits  and not merely be derived from those products while retaining some of their character consideredH P Mercantile Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases

additives    First Issue  Whether the Edenvale products consist wholly  Item   or at least   by volume  Item   of the juices of fruits  The phrase  juices of fruits It is common ground that the phrase  juices of fruits  does not have a trade meaning  The applicant submitted  through the line of reasoning rejected in P   N  see   and   above  that  juices of fruits  is  fruit juice  as defined in the Food Standards Code   which defines  fruit juice  to include products that have been concentrated and later reconstituted with water to a concentration consistent with that of the undiluted juice from which it was made  The Commissioner did not accept that  juices of fruits  is synonymous with  fruit juice  the first step in the applicant s line of reasoning  Insofar as the applicant called in aid the second column of the Table  the Commissioner submitted that this was not permissible  s     of the GST Act  According to the Commissioner  there is no ambiguity  obscurity or manifestly absurd or unreasonable result flowing from the ordinary meaning of the text  taking into account its context and the purpose or object underlying it  which would mandate such recourse  see subs      The Commissioner submitted that the phrase  juices of fruits  not having a trade meaning  is to be interpreted according to its ordinary English meaning  In this regard  juice  is relevantly defined to mean   The Oxford English Dictionary         a  The watery or liquid part of vegetables or fruits  which can be expressed or extracted  commonly containing the characteristic flavour and other properties      Macquarie Dictionary          the liquid part of plant or animal substance            any extracted liquid  especially from a fruit According to the Commissioner  the ordinary meaning of  juices  in the context of the GST Act  suggests that  juices of fruits  is the liquid extracted from those fruits  The extraction process entails that the juice originally formed  part  of the fruit and  therefore  the juice is extracted from the fruit through some mechanical process such as pressing or crushing  Similarly in the current proceedings the Food Standards Code could have no relevance for the same reason  As Gzell J said in P   N at         The phrase had its origin in  juices of Australian fruits  in   well before the gazettal of the Foods Standards Code in    It was unreal to say that the code preceded the GST Act when the origin of Item   in the table in cl   of Sch   preceded the code  I agree with the Commissioner s submissions  In my view  they compel the conclusion that the phrase  juices of fruits  in Items   and   of the Table is to have its ordinary English meaning of being confined to juices extracted from fruits and does not extend to  fruit juice  in the wider embrace of that term in trade parlance  assisted or unassisted by the definition in the Food Standards Code  The phrase  consist of The carbonated Edenvale product will only qualify for GST free status under Item   of the Table if it   consist s  wholly of juices of fruits  at the supply point and the non carbonated Edenvale products will only qualify for GST free status under Item   of the Table  if they consist of at least   by volume of juices of fruits  at the supply point  emphasis added   Subject to the de minimis rule applying  which was not argued in P   N   Gzell J stated that  wholly  meant    At        I n my view     Item   must be construed according to its ordinary meaning              The concession by P   N that the word  wholly  meant   was a proper one  Items   and   in the table to cl   in Sch   of the GST Act are  respectively  concentrates for making non alcoholic beverages if the concentrates consist of at least   by volume of juices of fruit  and non alcoholic non carbonated beverages if they consist of at least   by volume of juices of fruit or vegetables  In that context   wholly  must  in my view  mean       And later at     It follows from my finding that any trade meaning derived from the Foods Standards Code is not attracted by the legislation and my rejection of the argument that the ordinary meaning of the phrase  wholly of juices of fruits  encompasses fruit drinks with non fruit based additives  that P   N must fail  Having accepted that to qualify for exemption  the fruit drinks of P   N must consist of   of juices of fruits  the introduction of even     of non fruit based additives means that the exemption is not attracted  No de minimis argument was raised on behalf of P   N  The de minimis rule does not arise for consideration in the current context unless the rainwater that is added to the beverage is regarded as being part of the  juices of fruit   Dr Brooke Taylor in his further report  annexed to his affidavit sworn on   April   describes the product to which the  reconstitution   by way of the addition of rainwater  is made as follows  at para      W here a fruit juice product which contained ethanol was concentrated by a process of evaporation that removed the ethanol and the concentrate was later reconstituted with water to a concentration consistent with that of undiluted juice product  the resulting product would be fruit juice within the scope of the definition in Standard         Emphasis added      The reference to  fruit juice product  in the above extract is not a reference to either the fruit juice concentrate or low sugar juice  but to the de alcoholised base wine  The adding of rainwater to the de alcoholised base wine would not constitute the reconstitution of juices of fruit as the de alcoholised base wine at that point in the process  even if it was  concentrated  does not constitute juices of fruit  In any event  the de minimis rule has no scope to operate in circumstances where the clear intent of the legislature was that the product consist of   of the juices of fruit  This is made clear by the fact that in the case of Items   and   of the Table the requirement imposed by the legislature for the volume of juices of fruit was  at least   which had the effect of allowing the beverage to include non fruit based additives without the loss of the exemption referred toThe Wik Peoples v The State of Queensland     CLR  Reference was also made to the canon of statutory construction that terms used in statutes that are in pari materia should be given the same meaning unless there is a clear indication to the contrary  Attorney General v Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover   AC   at   per Viscount Simonds  The Wik Peoples v The State of Queensland     CLR   at   per Gummow J referred toZeroz Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation     ATR  His Honour observed at   that it was common ground that the phrase  juices of fruits  does not have a trade meaning  At   he referred to what was said by a Full Court of this Court in Zeroz Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation     ATR   at    if there is no trade usage then a fortiori the expression must be used in its ordinary English sense   But P   N in that case  like the applicant in this case  made a number of submissions which  at the risk of doing the applicant a disservice  went something like this    While the phrase  juices of fruits  does not have a trade meaning  the phrase is synonymous with  fruit juice  and that term had a trade meaning as defined in the Food Standards Code     The Food Standards Code is a reference to the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code as defined in the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act    Cth   The Food Standards Code   standard       with respect to fruit juice and vegetable juice  defined fruit juice or vegetable juice as the liquid portion  with or without pulp  obtained from fruit or vegetables respectively and in the case of citrus fruit  other than lime  the endocarp only of the fruit and included products that had been concentrated and later reconstituted with water to a concentration consistent with that of the undiluted juice from which it had been made  At   and   his Honour observed that it was common ground that the fruit drinks supplied by P   N met the Food Standards Code requirements  It was also common ground that P   N fruit drinks contained non fruit based additives  vitamins and minerals or used processing aids within the limits permitted by the Food Standards Code   The evidence was that the fruit drinks contained       fruit juice and       additives and processing aids not directly derived from fruit     In substituting a trade meaning of  fruit juice  for  juices of fruits  that has no trade meaning  reliance was placed on Collector of Customs v Agfa Gevaert Ltd   HCA         CLR   where the phrase  silver dye bleach reversal process  in a tariff concession had no trade meaning but the words  silver dye bleach process  did  The High Court held that the Tribunal s construction of the composite phrase by reference to the trade meaning of the lesser phrase and the ordinary meaning of the word  reversal  involved no error of law  The submission  by parity of reasoning  was that in the Item   composite phrase  wholly of juices of fruits  the word  wholly  should be given its ordinary meaning and the words  juices of fruits   in both Items   and   should be given the trade meaning for  fruit juice      That having adopted the Foods Standards Code prior to the introduction of the GST Act  its concepts were well known to the Parliament and that it may be taken to have had regard to them in respect of a law dealing with the exemption of food  In this regard  in Zeroz   reference had been made by the taxpayer to the Food Standards Code  as it then existed  for the purpose of ascertaining the trade meaning of a term in the sales tax legislation  A Full Court of this Court said at   and       One might wonder at the relevance in interpreting a statutory provision first incorporated in legislation effective from   September    when Item   of the   Act was introduced by Act No   of   of a standard not published until   and on the evidence still the subject of consideration and alteration until that date   p               It is hard to accept that a public document still in the process of formulation and not yet published at the time the word  yoghurt  was introduced into the sales tax law should be seen as the source of a definition of the expression  yoghurt  in statute passed years earlier   p
