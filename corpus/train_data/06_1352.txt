edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn Agar v Hyde   HCA         CLR   at           Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow and Hayne JJ held that the old test for summary disposal had been expressed in various ways but that all had described a high degree of certainty about the ultimate outcome of the proceeding if it were allowed to go to trial in the ordinary way  They said that a less demanding test should not be applied where a defendant sought to have service of proceedings overseas set aside  The fundamental reason why their Honours rejected the general law adoption of a more lenient test was because it was unclear as to what new criterion was to be applied  They said       Are proceedings to be terminated upon a prediction  on what would almost invariably be less evidence and argument than would be available to trial  of the  likely  or  probable  outcome of the proceeding  That cannot be so  It would be wrong to deny a plaintiff resort to the ordinary processes of a court on the basis of a prediction made at the outset of a proceeding if that prediction is to be made simply on a preponderance of probabilities  And if it is not to be enough to persuade the court that it is more probable than not that the case against a defendant will fail  and some higher test  less than that now applied in applications for summary judgment  is to be applied  how is that test to be described  The attachment of intensifying epithets  such as  very  or  highly  offers little useful guidance for those judicial officers who would have to apply the test and who would have to do so  often enough  in a busy practice list  Such a test would be unworkable  And  more recently  in Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales   HCA         ALR   at       Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and

Banking Group Limited   FCA   at    unreported  Beaumont J    November   Beaumont J followed Park v Allied Mortgage Corporation Ltd   ATPR  Digest      at   and     FCA   at     where Davies J said       In my opinion  a right to claim damages under ss    and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  is  in general  a bare right of action which cannot be assigned  I am not speaking of an assignment such as may occur on the bankruptcy or death of a person or on the merger of a company into another entity  Absent such special circumstances  a right to claim under ss    and   cannot  in my opinion  be assigned  Section   provides               A person who suffers loss or damage by conduct of another person that was done in contravention of a provision of Part IV or V may recover the amount of the loss or damage by action against that other person or against any person involved in the contravention             The section does not allow for the award of damages in respect of a loss which was not suffered by any party to the proceedings  Both the terms of the statutory provision and the principle as enunciated in cases such as Dawson v Great Northern   City Railway Co      KB   at     Defries v Milne     Ch   and Pulton v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at   preclude Mrs Regan from suing for damages in respect of any loss suffered by Mr and Mrs Park  Mr and Mrs park have discontinued their claims and that is an end to them      The assignment has effect  however  insofar as it assigns to Mrs Regan all the entitlement of Mr and Mrs Park under the mortgage into which all the applicants had entered as mortgagees  Thus  if any ancillary relief under s    depends upon the approval or request of the mortgagors  the remaining applicants now hold all interests in respect thereof  citedBatistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAnd  more recently  in Batistatos v Roads and Traffic

the particular circumstances  This includes the principles respecting abuse of process  followedBernstrom v National Australia Bank     Qd R  A number of cases have looked at how s  A of the Federal Court Act might work  GE Capital argued that the Court should engage in a predictive assessment as to whether the proceedings had no reasonable prospect of success  It relied upon the analogy with the similar wording of s   of the Legal Profession Act    NSW   and their analogues  although it accepted that there were differences in the way that that legislation worked  However  the concept of a claim so lacking in merit or substance as to be not fairly arguable was suggested as being helpful   Lemoto v Able Technical Pty Ltd   NSWCA         NSWLR   at     per McColl JA   In addition  reliance was placed on Bernstrom v National Australia Bank     Qd R   at   that a party who seeks to resist a claim for summary judgment on rr   and   of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules    Qld  which are similar to  but not identical to s  A  should provide evidence of this basic material to support the arguability of its claim  I now turn to the claim for breach of contract  New Boston was correct in arguing that in an application under s  A the Court should take the allegations in the disputed pleading at their highest   Bernstrom v National Australia Bank Ltd     Qd R   at    In that context it is possible to see an argument that an express representation may have been made as to the volume of business which GE Capital would provide to old Boston under the GE Capital contract  It is also possible that new Boston may be able to establish  as it alleges  that an effective assignment occurred of the rights which old Boston had under the GE Capital contract  However  the claim sought to be assigned is of a right to sue for unliquidated damages for breach of contract which new Boston claims to have acquired only because of the effect of the transaction in which it acquired old Boston s business  Old Boston is not a party to the proceedings  It does not exist  New Boston has made no application to amend  to reinstate it or join it  For the reasons given above  I do not consider there are any reasonable prospects of success of an argument for new Boston that an effective assignment of contractual rights can be proved  The claim in contract alleges that GE Capital was in breach of the GE Capital contract because  the entire agreement was for  GE Capital  to provide  old Boston  with instructions in respect of   of defaulting customers per State in Australia to effect the field agent s services based on representations made by  GE Capital  citedButcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlWhile the High Court has not specifically determined this issue  I am of opinion that it is not reasonably arguable  having regard to the decisions to which I have referred and the authorities on which they are based  that new Boston could succeed in the enforcement of any assignment under the sale agreement of causes of action under s   of the Act to recover loss or damage suffered by old Boston  Only a person who suffers loss or damage by the conduct done in contravention of a relevant provision of the Act can recover under s    As Gleeson CJ  Hayne and Heydon JJ said in Butcher v Lachlan Elder Realty Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       in a case where monetary relief is sought by a plaintiff who alleges that a particular misrepresentation was made to an identified person  of whom the plaintiff was one       The plaintiff must establish a causal link between the impugned conduct and the loss that is claimed  That depends on analysing the conduct of the defendant in relation to that plaintiff alone  Of course  here  new Boston does not claim a misrepresentation was made to it  but rather to old Boston  However  I do not consider that in the circumstances of the pleading in the present case  any material difference can be established so as to entitle new Boston  which did not exist at the time that the alleged representations were made  to assert some freestanding cause of action under the Act quite divorced from anything to do with old Boston approvedconsideredCampbells Cash and Carry Pty Ltd v Fostif Pty Ltd   HCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe latter proposition was cited with approval by Ipp JA  giving the leading judgment  in Project   Pty Ltd v Tim Barr Pty Limited   NSWCA   at         Ipp JA noted that such an interest  as is described by Lord Roskill  had to be a  legitimate interest  which was distinct from the benefit the person supporting the action sought to derive from the litigation and something beyond a mere personal interest in profiting from the outcome of the proceedings   NSWCA   at   see also Zhu v Domson Pty Ltd   NSWCA   at       per Spigelman CJ   Since judgment was reserved in this matter  the High Court has decided Campbells Cash and Carry Pty Ltd v Fostif Pty Ltd   HCA    There  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ referred to this issue  although  as Callinan and Heydon JJ pointed out it only  received some mention before this Court   see   HCA   at      Gleeson CJ and Kirby J did not discuss this point  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ observed that the House of Lords  conclusion in Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse   AC   was that an agreement permitting a bank  which guaranteed the costs of a party to litigation in which the bank itself was also interested  to sell the party s claims in a litigation  savours of champerty   since it involves trafficking in litigation a type of transaction which  under English law  is contrary to public policy    HCA      Accordingly  the House of Lords held the assignment of the cause of action there was void  However  as Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ pointed out their Lordships  decision to stay the proceedings was founded upon an exclusive Swiss law jurisdiction clause  not upon any consideration of public policy concerning maintenance or champerty   HCA   at    They noted that there was no case where maintenance or champerty had been held to be defence to  or reason enough to stay  an action that was maintained   HCA at    Ultimately  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ  with whom Gleeson CJ  at   and Kirby J  at   agreed on this issue  held that there was no abuse of process involved in someone seeking out those who may have claims  offering terms which gave the seeker control of the litigation and would also yield to the seeker  as it hoped and expected  a significant profit   HCA   at    Callinan and Heydon JJ said   HCA   at        If the transaction between  the seeker  and each retailer had taken the form of an assignment to  the seeker  so that it could sue as plaintiff  the claim would fail because the assignment would be ineffective  Whether in an endeavour to escape that consequence  or for some other reason  the transaction took a different form  Callinan and Heydon JJ said that there was a serious question whether the Court of Appeal had been correct in concluding that  on the issue of the assignability of the cause of action  which had not been debated before it and of which only some mention had been made before the High Court  the retailer s action for money had and received was historically a claim in debt which was readily assignable without engaging the principles of about trafficking in litigation   HCA   at    They referred  among other things  to what Williams  Webb and Kitto JJ had said in Poulton v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at   followedChapman v Luminis Pty Ltd  No     FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlBeaumont J agreed saying that in his view the contrary was not reasonably arguable  Lindgren J followed both these decisions in National Mutual Property Services  Australia  v CitiBank Ltd     ALR   at   as did von Doussa J in Chapman v Luminis  No     FCA         FCR   at             And  in Pritchard v Racecage Pty Ltd     FCR   at  F G Branson J  with whom Spender and Olney JJ agreed  applied the reasoning of Davies and Lindgren JJ to hold that the estate of a deceased person could not satisfy the statutory requirement of s   of being a  person  who suffered loss or damage  Her Honour also held that the estate could not satisfy the statutory requirements of s   of the Act of being  a person who is a party to the proceeding  or  a person who has suffered  or is likely to suffer  loss or damage  citedDeputy Commissioner of Taxation v Salcedo     Qd R  In particular  new Boston submitted that the new test to be applied should not equate to a finding that the claim must have reasonable prospects of success

Williams JA  with whom McMurdo P at   and Atkinson J at     agreed  held that the approach adopted by Lord Woolf MR in Swain v Hillman     All ER   at   was appropriate  The Master of the Rolls said  at        The words  no real prospect of being successful or succeeding  do not need any amplification  they speak for themselves  The word  real  distinguishes fanciful prospects of success or     they direct the court to the need to see whether there is a  realistic  as opposed to a  fanciful  prospect of success  consideredEx Christmas Islanders Assocation Inc v The Attorney General for the Commonwealth  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlIn Ex Christmas Islanders Association Inc v The Attorney General for the Commonwealth  No     FCA   at   French J pointed out that the power to award costs against a legal practitioner has been approached in different ways by State appellate courts and Full Courts of this Court as exemplified in Levick v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR    under provisions such as s   of the Federal Court Act and O   r   of the Federal Court Rules    He reasoned that considerations of whether legal practitioners should be ordered to pay costs under the provisions governing this Court s jurisdiction depended upon whether there had been an error in the observation by a legal practitioner of a duty owed to the Court  French J followed the approach of the Privy Council in Harley v McDonald   UKPC         AC   at     where their Lordships said       The essential point is that it is not errors of judgment that attract the exercise of the jurisdiction  but errors of a duty owed to the court    see also at     AC at         and Cook v Pasminco Ltd   FCA   per Stone J and  the article by N

htmlGE Capital pointed out that the purpose to which s  A was directed was to provide a more lenient test than the traditional one reflected by the exception which s  A  creates  The latter provision identifies the concepts of hopelessness or being bound to fail which were part of the old test explained by Barwick CJ in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways  NSW    HCA         CLR   at     and provides that these are no longer the only basis for summary judgment  GE Capital relied on the second reading speech and explanatory memorandum for the introduction of s  A to show that it was the intention of the Parliament to give the Court greater flexibility than Barwick CJ s well known test provided to strike out claims which were unlikely ever to succeed  And  more

find for the plaintiff  unless that evidence is so negligible in character as to amount only to a scintilla  the judge should not direct the jury to find a verdict for the defendant  nor should the Full Court direct the entry of such a verdict  The principle upon which the section is based is that it is for the jury to decide all questions of fact  and therefore to determine which witnesses

and             per Kirby J  see also at         per McHugh J I am of opinion that in assessing what reasonable prospects of success are for the purposes of s  A  the Court must be very cautious not to do a party an injustice by summarily dismissing the proceedings where  in accordance with the principles in Hocking v Bell   HCA         CLR   contested evidence might reasonably be believed one way or the other so as to enable one side or the other to succeed  As soon as the evidence may have such an ambivalent character prior to a final determination  I am of opinion that then  as a matter of law  at that point there are reasonable prospects of success within the meaning of s  A  Unless only one conclusion can be said to be reasonable  the moving party will not have discharged its onus to enliven the discretion to authorize a summary termination of the proceedings which s  A envisages  In moving the second reading of the bill introducing s  A  the Migration Litigation Reform Bill

those discussions which were ongoing  This assertion was made during the hearing and confirmed in Mr Gower s affidavit  which was filed on the following day  GE Capital objected to the affidavit being read as its contents were not accepted as accurate  Given that the way in which new Boston s claims were being put was in issue on the return of the motion I will read the affidavit but limit its use under s   of the Evidence Act    Cth  to evidence of an assertion of Mr Gower s state of mind and not as evidence of the truth of the assertion  GE Capital has not had an opportunity to test Mr Gower s assertion  In any event  I regard the assertion as providing no adequate explanation of the failure to provide particulars in a serious piece of contested commercial litigation  The provision of particulars of the way in which new Boston claimed its case was being put would obviously have assisted  if it were possible  new Boston s case in resisting the motion  New Boston sought to resist the application but propounded a fallback position that should be granted leave to amend its claims for relief in s  AC to include an allegation of unconscionable conduct in respect of itself and  to plead continuing representations by GE Capital  I was informed that there were emails between GE Capital and both new Boston and old Boston addressing the issue of the agreed amount of referrals and the number actually provided  New Boston also made an oral application to plead a claim in quantum meruit on the basis that if there were no contract between GE Capital and new Boston for the services provided after   July   then new Boston should be allowed to make such a claim  New Boston argued that the less generous negotiated rate between GE Capital and old Boston for the provision of field calls  calculated on the basis of the volume of   per month  could be revisited based on the higher fixed costs and lower number of referrals which new Boston had in carrying out those field calls  Beaumont J agreed saying that in his view the contrary was not reasonably arguable  Lindgren J followed both these decisions in National Mutual Property Services  Australia  v CitiBank Ltd     ALR

depends upon the approval or request of the mortgagors  the remaining applicants now hold all interests in respect thereof  The construction arrived at by the authorities  on s   to which I have referred  is reinforced by a consideration of the subsequently introduced amendment to s   in s  B   That subsection specifically provides that the damages  that the claimant may recover  are capable of being reduced by reason of the claimant s share of responsibility  It is difficult to see how the Court could award a third party that which the statute only authorises the claimant to recover  Moreover  s  B  shows that it is only the person entitled to recover damages who can have the damages recoverable reduced by reason of that person s share of responsibility for the loss of damage  A stranger would be in the position identified by Hamilton LJ in Defries v Milne     Ch   at    see too Poulton v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at   where he said of an attempt to assign to a plaintiff a cause of action for the tort of waste       The plaintiff is under no measurable liability to  the defendants    and one essential ingredient in the plaintiff s cause of action in tort fails  and fails altogether  It seems to me  therefore  that the plaintiff has no direct right of action here because he has not been damnified  The pleading itself asserts that the relevant representations were made to old Boston and that old Boston relied on the representations in formulating its costings thereby incurring loss or damage  The statement of claim also alleges that between November   and November   GE Capital provided old Boston with less than half of the agreed amount of defaulting customers on whom to effect the field agent services  During the course of argument the reference to November   was amended to June    Obviously  after   July   old Boston did not purport to provide any services  For the reasons I have given above  in whatever way this claim is formulated  s   permits only old Boston to recover that loss or damage  Because s   also gives a right to recover loss or damage to a person who suffers it by conduct of another person that was in contravention of s  AC   for the reasons given above  that cause of action is not capable of assignment to new Boston  It has no reasonable prospect of being successfully prosecuted by new Boston against GE Capital  New Boston argued that I should not follow the decision of the High Court in Poulton v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at     which denied that a right of action in tort was assignable at all  It was suggested that this was the old view of the law  New Boston argued that I should follow what what Debelle J said of it in South Australian Management Corporation v Sheahan     ACSR   at   namely that the decision could be explained as relating to an assignment of a claim in tort where the assignee had no genuine commercial interest  However  in Garcia v National Australia Bank Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow and Hayne JJ made it clear that the doctrine of precedent in Australia binds me to follow the decisions of the High Court unless and until that court decides that the time is right for a change in the law  I propose to do that  There is no basis to read down the considered judgment of Williams  Webb and Kitto JJ in Poulton v The Commonwealth     CLR at   that a right of action in tort is incapable of assignment at law or in equity  I am of opinion that Debelle J was wrong not to have applied this binding authority  Callinan and Heydon JJ said that there was a serious question whether the Court of Appeal had been correct in concluding that  on the issue of the assignability of the cause of action  which had not been debated before it and of which only some mention had been made before the High Court  the retailer s action for money had and received was historically a claim in debt which was readily assignable

Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     Dawson  Gaudron and McHugh JJ said that a party should not be shut out from litigating an issue which was fairly arguable and that the power to grant leave to amend should be exercised with that in mind  They observed   CLR at   that     the ultimate aim of a court is the attainment of justice   Obviously  s  A regulates the attainment of justice by creating an entitlement in a party to be protected from claims or defences which fail to meet the threshold prescribed in the section  In granting leave to appeal on a decision involving the application of s  A  Wilcox J observed in Vans  Inc v Offprice Com Au Pty Ltd   FCA   at   that it was arguable that the effect of s  A was that there could be summary judgment for an applicant      notwithstanding the possibility that the applicant s case will break down at trial  in other words  it is now not enough for a party resisting a summary judgment application to seek merely to put the other side to proof   his Honour s emphasis   I have considered whether I should allow new Boston an opportunity to replead  At the hearing  new Boston orally sought leave to amend its claim under s  AC of the Act to allege that the conduct relied on in the statement of claim was also addressed to new Boston  It sought leave to plead that GE Capital made continuing representations to not only old Boston but also to new Boston and to plead a claim in quantum meruit  There is no evidence to support the claim of new Boston under s  AC or the allegation of continuing representations  I do not consider that claims which are entirely unsupported by evidence  and are inherently unlikely  should be allowed to be made by an amendment of the kind proposed  As explained above  if new Boston wishes to make a claim in quantum meruit  it will need to do so in fresh proceedings on a basis that is properly articulated  There is nothing on the material before me to show that any such claim is fairly arguable  Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Limited     CLR   at      I consider that the pleading and the material before me is so fundamentally flawed that I should not grant leave to amend  Because this is not a decision on the merits  it will be open to those advising new Boston to take further proceedings  if some can be formulated  which can articulate a cause of action which has reasonable prospects of success  I am of opinion that these proceedings should be dismissed      I certify that the preceding one hundred and five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons

HCA  htmlThe analogy suggested between the threshold of a standard of  no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting a proceeding  and situations in which legal practitioners have been held by

Boston  Old Boston never sought to pursue whatever rights it might have had to bring those claims and has now ceased to exist  It is not pleaded that any contract or pre contractual representation alleged to give rise to a contractual term was ever made to new Boston  on the contrary  it is pleaded that all relevant dealings going to the formation of the GE Capital contract were between GE Capital and old Boston  In Rossetto v Meriton Apartments Pty Limited   FCA   at         Bennett J held that a company incorporated after representations were made to its director who at the time of the incorporation had been informed that the representations were untrue and had been offered rescission of the contract  had no arguable cause of action for the purposes of O   r    There is  of course  a distinction here  While new Boston must have been aware at the time of the sale agreement that the representation was untrue  if it became a contractual term  because it had been breached by GE Capital in relation to the number of field service calls  no offer had been made for rescission disapprovedSouth Australian Management Corporation v Sheahan     ACSR  New Boston argued that I

Taxation v Salcedo     Qd R   the Queensland Court of Appeal considered rr   and   of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules    Qld  and Pt   of the Civil Procedure Rules  Eng  which had come into force in England and Wales in    Williams JA  with whom McMurdo P at   and Atkinson J at     agreed  held that the approach adopted by Lord Woolf MR in Swain v Hillman     All ER   at   was appropriate  The Master of the Rolls said  at        The words  no real prospect of being successful or succeeding  do not need any amplification  they speak for themselves  The word  real  distinguishes fanciful prospects of success or     they direct the court to the need to see whether there is a  realistic  as opposed to a  fanciful  prospect of success  Lord Hope discussed the scope of the enquiry occasioned by the English Rule saying     AC at        He said  of a provision which was like s  A  that it operates as an exception to the normal method by which issues of fact are tried in our courts  namely that once processes of discovery and interrogatories have been completed  the parties are allowed to lead their evidence so that the trial judge can determine where the truth lies in the light of that evidence  However  if it were clear as a matter of law at the outset that even if a party was to succeed in proving all the facts that he  she or it offered to prove  the party would not be entitled to the remedy that was sought  then in such a case a trial of the facts would be a waste of time and money and it would be proper that action should be taken out of the court as soon as possible  Lord Hope instanced that in other cases it could be possible to say with confidence before trial that the factual basis for the claim was fanciful because it was entirely without substance  He said       It may be clear beyond question that the statement of facts is contradicted by all the documents or other material on which it is based  The simpler the case the easier it is likely to be to take that view and resort to what is properly called summary judgement  But more complex cases are unlikely to be capable of being resolved in that way without conducting a mini trial on the documents without discovery and without oral evidence  As Lord Woolf said in Swain v Hillman  at p   that is not the object of the rule  It is designed to deal with cases that are not fit for trial at all  Lord Hobhouse noted that the English rule required the judge to undertake an exercise of judgment  He emphasised that the power was a discretionary one  being one where the choice the judge has is whether to exercise the power or not based on  ultimately  the judge s ultimate assessment of its appropriateness having regard to the prospects of success of the relevant party     AC at      He said that under the rule           the judge is making an assessment not conducting a trial or fact finding exercise  Whilst it must be remembered that the wood is composed of trees some of which may need to be looked at individually  it is the assessment of the whole that is called for  A measure of analysis may be necessary but the  bottom line  is what ultimately matters      The criterion which the judge has to apply under Part   is not one of probability  it is absence of reality  He went on to note that the judge s assessment had to start with the relevant party s pleaded case but that the inquiry did not end there  He said that the allegations could be legally adequate but may have no realistic chance of being proved  On the other hand  Lord Hobhouse noted  the limitations in the allegations pleaded  alongside any lack of particularisation  may show that the party s case was hopeless     AC at      Although Lord Hobhouse and Lord Millett were in dissent  I do not think that their identification of the principles was different to those expressed by the majority  Lord Steyn      AC at     agreed with Lord Hope and Lord Hutton  and see     AC at     per

Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlFurther  the claims under ss  AC and   of the Act must be approached on the basis that there is a written agreement between the parties containing terms which are expressly in the teeth of alleged representations or of alleged oral contractual terms  Absent some misrepresentation  the written agreement executed by the person complaining must be taken as authoritative  Toll  FGCT  Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at                The process of negotiation was pleaded and was also referred to by Mr Harrison in his affidavit  The time in which substantial cost and effort were said to have been expended causing old Boston damage in preparing its proposal  involved about   days in February    Following that  whatever may have happened in the meantime about which no complaint is made  only in November   was the GE Capital contract signed  The GE Capital contract appears to have been the result of a long process of negotiation  There is no suggestion that its terms were misrepresented  However  the written form of the GE Capital contract expressly negated any promise of a particular level of referrals to old Boston by GE Capital  Services Sch par    Old Boston had every opportunity to review the proffered terms which  according to Mr Harrison  GE Capital had sent in early September   before it signed them in November    There is no basis that appears in the pleading or in Mr Harrison s affidavit to support a claim that the express terms of the GE Capital contract were misrepresented to old Boston before it signed  Further  the statement of claim pleads the claim under s  AC in a way which is not easy to comprehend  It does not disclose any intelligible basis on which it could be found that GE Capital acted in contravention of s  AC by proffering the GE Capital contract to old Boston for consideration before signing  The allegations have no substance  The manner in which GE Capital was performing during the period in which old Boston purported to carry out the GE Capital contract indicated that the GE Capital was not acting on the basis of any such promise  Both old and new Boston knew this by July    These factors induce me to consider that the claims have no reasonable prospect of succeeding although I cannot say that it is hopeless or bound to fail  I think that this view is reinforced by the difficulty with which the pleader has sought to articulate the claims  In Toll  FGCT  Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at           the High Court held that where parties had signed a written contract  they were to be taken as intending the act of signature to be conclusive  absent misrepresentation or fraud  While misrepresentations had been pleaded as to the statements made many months earlier in February   when the parties actually signed the written agreement on   November   there is no material before me which suggests that old Boston could have been acting under the influence of any misrepresentation as to the terms of the GE Capital contract  Its terms were in writing  they had been provided to old Boston in advance  They were not in the form of a contract of adhesion  Old Boston was free to sign or not the GE Capital contract as it pleased  Old Boston had the opportunity to review and consider the draft or proffered terms  In those circumstances  I consider that there is no reasonable prospect that old Boston would be able to establish  as alleged in the statement of claim  that there was a term of the GE Capital contract that some minimum number of field calls would be referred to old Boston per month  Such a proposition is not only expressly excluded by express words in the services schedule of the GE Capital contract  it is also inconsistent with the entire agreement clause  In considering the claim in contract  it is important to appreciate that there is no claim that the GE Capital contract was vitiated by misrepresentation  Rather  it is claimed that an additional term was made either orally or by conduct which was part of that contract  although inconsistent with the express terms to which I have just referred  In Toll  FGCT  Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne  Callinan and Heydon JJ referred to the position of a person acting on behalf of a company who signed a contractual document without reading it  They noted that the person could have read the contract had he wished and that the other party did not set out to conceal from him the terms and conditions on the document or to encourage him not to read them  As their Honours said  the other party      had no way of knowing that he did not read the document  No case of mistake or non est factum is advanced   They continued   CLR at          This Court  in Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas     HCA       CLR   has recently reaffirmed the principle of objectivity by which the rights and liabilities of the parties to a contract are determined  It is not the subjective beliefs or understandings of the parties about their rights and liabilities that govern their contractual relations  What matters is what each party by words and conduct would have led a reasonable person in the position of the other party to believe  References to the common intention of the parties to a contract are to be understood as referring to what a reasonable person would understand by the language in which the parties have expressed their agreement  The meaning of the terms of a contractual document is to be determined by what a reasonable person would have understood them to mean  That  normally  requires consideration not only of the text  but also of the surrounding circumstances known to the parties  and the purpose and object of the transaction   Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas   HCA         CLR   at          In trade and commerce  it is important that the courts encourage certainty in contractual relations  Here the parties entered into a contract at arms length in which there was a full opportunity to negotiate and where  as also in Toll  FGCT  Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at               the parties had a full opportunity beforehand to consider the written terms which they signed  Neither party insisted on including what is now said to be a critical and agreed term which is inconsistent with what they signed  I do not think that there is any reasonable prospect that old Boston would have been able to establish that the alleged term as to the minimum number of field calls per month was in fact a term of the GE Capital contract  As Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne  Callinan and Heydon JJ said   CLR at            It should not be overlooked that to sign a document known and intended to affect legal relations is an act which itself ordinarily conveys a representation to a reasonable reader of the document  The representation is that the person who signs either has read and approved the contents of the document or is willing to take the chance of being bound by those contents  as Latham CJ put it  whatever they might be  That representation is even stronger where the signature appears below a perfectly legible written request to read the document before signing it  Moreover  cl  a v  of the GE Capital contract provided that GE Capital was able without liability to terminate that agreement immediately by written notice if old Boston entered into liquidation or any other type of insolvency or if it ceased to conduct business to properly give effect to the GE Capital contract  By cl  b  GE Capital was also able to end the GE Capital agreement or a particular services schedule at its discretion at any time by giving   days written notice  Next  cl  d  provided that if GE Capital did terminate the GE Capital contract  other than pursuant to cl  b  no further amounts would be payable to old Boston even if they had already been invoiced  Again  the existence of those clauses tends to suggest that any term involving the non termination of the GE Capital agreement for the proposed two year term could not be implied into the agreement and no such representation would have any reasonable prospect of being established  Accordingly  while it may be arguable that old Boston incurred expenses in performing the task of preparing a response to GE Capital s invitation to provide field services in February   and to that extent incurred some damage  I am of opinion that by the time the GE Capital contract was entered into in November   the effect of those representations was well and truly spent  There is nothing in the material before me to indicate there is any reasonable prospect of new Boston establishing that it is entitled to enforce a contractual term to the effect alleged or that it can rely upon any representations or contraventions of s   of the Act  New Boston sought to argue that the GE Capital contract was constructed on the basis of a price per call which old Boston had provided in February   after doing the analysis based on the minimum number of calls per month  While that may have been the subjective intention of old Boston  the written agreement which it and GE Capital signed in November   does not reflect anything other than a price which both parties were prepared to agree would be payable upon GE Capital referring any calls to old Boston  Toll  FGCT  Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       GE Capital also argued that on its proper construction the sale agreement did not purport to assign the right of old Boston to claims it may have had as at the date of the sale agreement for breach of contract or under the Act  even if the latter were assignable discussedTrendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse   AC  New Boston argued that the decision of the House of Lords in Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse   AC   at      D  F G supported its title to sue  New Boston said that it had a sufficient interest independent of the assignment in the sale agreement to justify it being able to assert old Boston s rights  But it is clear from the way in which the matter has been pleaded and from the evidence  that there was no pre existing relationship  ie before the sale agreement  between old Boston and new Boston  The sale agreement was intended to  in effect  have new Boston step into old Boston s business and carry it on for reasons which are not currently before me  This is not a case such as where a mortgagee having lent money to a mortgagor finds itself in the position where both were induced to enter into the original financing and undertaking of the purchase by misleading or fraudulent conduct of the third party so as to support some interest independent of contract  The effect of the decision of the House of Lords in Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse   AC   was debated in argument  In particular  new Boston relied on passages in the speeches of Lord Wilberforce   AC at   and Lord Roskill   AC at     esp at  D and F G   There  Lord Wilberforce said that provided that the assignor had a genuine and substantial interest in the success of the litigation  by giving a guarantee of the costs previously incurred  it would have been able  without offending the common law against maintenance or champerty  to have taken a security interest in the litigation or its proceeds   AC at  D E   Lord Roskill spoke to similar effect when he said   AC at  F G       If the assignment is of a property right or interest and the cause of action is ancillary to that right or interest  or if the assignee had a genuine commercial interest in taking the assignment and in enforcing it for his own benefit  I see no reason why the assignment should be struck down as an assignment of a bare cause of action or a savouring of maintenance  The latter proposition was cited with approval by Ipp JA  giving the leading judgment  in Project   Pty Ltd v Tim Barr Pty Limited   NSWCA   at         Ipp JA noted that such an interest  as is described by Lord Roskill  had to be a  legitimate interest  which was distinct from the benefit the person supporting the action sought to derive from the litigation and something beyond a mere personal interest in profiting from the outcome of the proceedings   NSWCA   at   see also Zhu v Domson Pty Ltd   NSWCA   at       per Spigelman CJ   Since judgment was reserved in this matter  the High Court has decided Campbells Cash and Carry Pty Ltd v Fostif Pty Ltd   HCA    There  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ referred to this issue  although  as Callinan and Heydon JJ pointed out it only  received some mention before this Court   see   HCA   at      Gleeson CJ and Kirby J did not discuss this point  Gummow  Hayne and Crennan JJ observed that the House of Lords  conclusion in Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse   AC   was that an agreement permitting a bank  which guaranteed the costs of a party to litigation in which the bank itself was also interested  to sell the party s claims in a litigation  savours of champerty   since it involves trafficking in litigation a type of transaction which  under English law  is contrary to public policy    HCA     citedVans  Inc v Offprice Com Au Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlIn Queensland v JL Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     Dawson  Gaudron and McHugh JJ said that a party should not be shut out from litigating an issue which was fairly arguable and that the power to grant leave to amend should be exercised with that in mind  They observed   CLR at   that     the ultimate aim of a court is the attainment of justice   Obviously  s  A regulates the attainment of justice by creating an entitlement in a party to be protected from claims or defences which fail to meet the threshold prescribed in the section  In granting leave to appeal on a decision involving the application of s  A  Wilcox J observed in Vans  Inc v Offprice Com Au Pty Ltd   FCA   at   that it was arguable that the effect of s  A was that there could be summary judgment for an applicant      notwithstanding the possibility that the applicant s case will break down at trial  in other words  it is now not enough for a party resisting a summary judgment application to seek merely to put the other side to proof   his Honour s emphasis  citedWardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlGE Capital argues that a claim under the Act cannot be assigned as a matter of law  The statutory cause of action under s   of the Act arises      when the plaintiff suffers loss or damage  by  contravening conduct of another person    Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Dawson  Gaudron and McHugh JJ   And  the plaintiff can only recover compensation for actual loss or damage incurred  as distinct from potential or likely damage   CLR at    What s   authorizes is the recovery of the amount of loss or damage at the suit of the person who suffers it  The terms of the section appear to confer a right which is personal to the person who suffers loss or damage by the conduct of another done in contravention of a relevant provision of the Act  Now s  B  provides that those damages may be reduced to the extent to which the Court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant s share in the responsibility for the loss or damage A number of decisions of this Court identify the cause of action for the recovery of damages under s   as not being one which is capable of assignment citedWalker v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlNew Boston argued that GE Capital had to take the allegations in the statement of claim at their highest in an argument of the present kind  It pointed to the decision of the Full Court in Walker v Citigroup Global Markets Australia Pty Ltd   FCAFC   at   which held that where there were inconsistent terms within the same contract  some being standard form terms while others were specially framed with the individual circumstances in mind  it will normally be appropriate to give greater effect to the specially negotiated terms  Here  new Boston had alleged that the promise for   or   field calls was contractual  and that its claim was clearly articulated  I am not sure that I could accept the clarity of the articulation in all respects  but the essential formulation was certainly able to be discerned in most instances  New Boston argued that s  A could not require both parties to put on evidence in detail or to conduct a mini trial  It submitted that it was not necessary for the case to be hopeless or bound to fail for it to have no reasonable prospect of success  but that the wording of s  A did no more to change the previous law on the availability of summary remedies citedWarwick Entertainment Centre Pty Limited v Alpine Holdings Pty Limited     ALR  In Warwick Entertainment Centre Pty Limited v Alpine Holdings Pty Limited     ALR   the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Western Australia held that it may not have been unreasonable for a party  who had been induced to enter into a contract by misrepresentations in breach of statutory norms such as s   of the Act  to affirm the contract  see e g    ALR at     per Steytler P   However  here  new Boston did not have any representations made to it  By voluntarily entering into some new arrangements with old Boston  it could hardly be said to have any damage to it caused by the breach of GE Capital s obligations owed to old Boston  In my opinion any such contention is unarguably bad followedWilliam Brandt s Sons Co v Dunlop Rubber Co   AC  The sale agreement did not dispose of or deal with any rights of old Boston to sue GE Capital for conduct in contravention of the Act  Whether or not rights to bring proceedings for damages under s   of the Act are assignable  in my opinion there is no reasonable prospect of success in new Boston s argument that the sale agreement effected a disposition of whatever rights old Boston had against GE Capital under the Act  Moreover  I do not think that  had the liquidator of old Boston sought to do so  new Boston could have prevented the liquidator enforcing old Boston s claims under the Act against GE Capital  Because of that  it seems to me that there is no reasonable prospect that it could be successfully argued by new Boston that an effective disposition of those rights had occurred  There was no communication from old Boston to GE Capital that assigned or made over whatever rights old Boston had in any respect  whether under the Act or in contract  to new Boston   William Brandt s Sons Co v Dunlop Rubber Co   AC   at    And  even though old Boston appears to have become deregistered  if the liquidator or creditors became aware that it had valuable rights against GE Capital  such as new Boston claims the rights it obtained under the sale agreement were  it is quite possible that steps might be taken to reregister old Boston to enable it to begin proceedings  I say all this because it seems to me to demonstrate the lack of efficacy of the basis upon which new Boston claims to assert old Boston s rights  I do not think that on the evidence before me there are reasonable prospects that such an argument could succeed  It may be countered that were old Boston reregistered  new Boston might be able to compel it to assign its rights in consequence of the provisions of the sale agreement  But no provision of the sale agreement offers reasonable prospects of success for new Boston to argue that it could compel the making over of old Boston s rights to sue under the Act  That agreement was silent on both that topic and the rights of old Boston to sue under that Act which were not part of the business the subject of the transfer  The damage which old Boston suffered  if any damage were suffered by the alleged contraventions  was a cause of action which appears  on any reasonably arguable construction of the sale agreement  to have been retained by old Boston  The sale agreement could not effect any assignment of the statutory causes of action to new Boston  It follows that GE Capital is entitled to have the claims against it under the Act dismissed on the basis that they have no reasonable prospect of being successfully prosecuted against it  No particular formality is required for an assignment for value to be valid and effective in equity  As Lord Macnaghten said in William Brandt s Sons Co v Dunlop Rubber Co   AC   at        The language is immaterial if the meaning is plain  All that is necessary is that the debtor should be given to understand that the debt has been made over by the creditor to some third person  As he continued  the real question is whether what is asserted to be an assignment is notice to the debtor that the assignee is  interested in the money    AC at    The letter sent by new  not old  Boston on   July   in terms related future invoices to new Boston s ABN  It was silent about the payment of the debts due on any old invoices  But in any event  old Boston did not write the letter and so it gave no instruction to GE Capital  Whatever debt GE Capital may have owed old Boston on   July   was never made over to new Boston  GE Capital could not have received a good discharge of any existing obligation to old Boston by paying new Boston  because old Boston never authorized GE Capital to do so
