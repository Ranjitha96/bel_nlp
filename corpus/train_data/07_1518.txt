apply The  Antonis P Lemos  in this regard  All the reasoning of Lord Brandon is equally applicable to s  f   I would only add the following remarks  Given the need for the   Convention to apply to a wide variety of legal systems and given the capacity of maritime claims to arise by reference to chartering and carriage arrangements often of some complexity  it would make little practical sense to limit the types of claims to which this paragraph was directed to contractual claims between parties to the agreement  Secondly  the provision is one in which jurisdiction is given to a court  It should be read liberally  The  Shin Kobe Maru    CLR at    Thirdly  The  Antonis P Lemos  was recently applied by a Full Court of this Court  though in a different context  that of construing an arbitration clause containing the phrase  arising out of  in Comandate Marine v Pan Australia Shipping Pty Limited   FCAFC         FCR   at       The Full Court  though in that different context  gave the same wide meaning to the phrase  arising out of  Comandate Marine v Pan Australia   FCR at           Thus  for these reasons  the fact that the plaintiff s claim is in tort and bailment does not mean that it cannot arise out of an agreement of the character described in s  f    Lord Brandon then went on to reject the second contention of the owners propounded by Mr Saville QC  that even if claims in tort were covered  only those which were  directly connected  with an agreement covered by the provision  that is one that related to the carriage of goods in a ship  and that such agreement was one between the plaintiff and defendant  His Lordship rejected this argument for the reasons Parker LJ had rejected it in the Court of Appeal  see  in the Court of Appeal    AC at     and in the House of Lords    AC at    That reasoning and Lord Brandon s reasoning and conclusions on both contentions permit the following to be stated  the claim which may be non contractual need only arise out of  in the sense of be connected with  some agreement having the relevant relationship with the carriage of goods in a ship  or other relational fact in s  f  even if that agreement is one to which the plaintiff is not a party  Thus  in The  Antonis P Lemos  the claim in tort could be seen to arise out of  that is be connected with any and all of the sub sub voyage charter  the sub time charter and the head time charter referred toElbe Shipping SA v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Jurisdiction is conferred upon the Court in

v The Ship  Global Peace    FCA         FCR   at             The fact that the events took place in the United Kingdom does not affect the question of jurisdiction  The Act confers jurisdiction

v Arkwright Boston Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Co   AC   Mr Cutler argued that the correct approach to the interpretation of s  f  could be found in Port of Geelong Authority v The  Bass Reefer      FCR   at     in which case Foster J adopted the approach of Lord Keith of Kinkel in Gatoil International Inc v Arkwright Boston Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Co   AC   at     and said that the relationship connoted by the words  that relates to  in s  f  must be  some reasonably direct connection   The same passage from Lord Keith s speech in Gatoil   AC at     was cited with apparent approval by Gummow J in Empire Shipping Company Inc v Owners of the Ship  Shin Kobe Maru      FCR   at    at first instance    These submission are answered by the proper application not only of Gatoil   AC   but also of Samick Lines Co Ltd v Owners of the  Antonis P Lemos    AC    Two phrases in s  f  are central to understanding the reach of the provision in the circumstances here    a claim arising out of an agreement  and   that relates to the carriage of goods    by a ship    The former was the subject of consideration in The  Antonis P Lemos    AC   the latter in Gatoil   AC     The ALRC Report made reference to both Gatoil  at   and   of the ALRC Report  and The  Antonis P Lemos   at   and   of the ALRC Report   No particular assistance is obtained from the discussion of these cases in the Report  The ALRC did recommend  however  in the context of these cases  that the proposed head of jurisdiction  s  f  follow the language of the Supreme Court Act    UK   the   UK Act  s  h  which was the provision dealt with in The  Antonis P Lemos  and which was the successor provision to the Administration of Justice Act    UK   the   UK Act  ss  h  and  e  being the relevant provisions dealing with England and Scotland  respectively  discussed and dealt with in Gatoil   Section  f  did follow  though not precisely  the language of the   UK Act  s  h   That section was as follows     any claim arising out of any agreement relating to the carriage of goods in a ship or to the use or hire of a ship  The   Act  ss  h  and s  e  were in the following terms    s  h     any claim arising out of any agreement relating to the carriage of goods in a ship or to the use of hire of a ship          s     Any claim arising out of any one or more of the following             e  any agreement relating to the carriage of goods in any ship whether by charterparty or otherwise      It is also important for the application of the principles attending construction of the Act to which I have referred to understand that the provisions in the   UK Act  and  through it the   UK Act  were passed to enable the United Kingdom to ratify and to comply with its international obligations under the   Convention  The  Eschersheim      WLR   at    per Lord Diplock  and Gatoil   AC at    per Lord Keith   Article   of the   Convention contained the following as part of the list of  maritime claims     Maritime claim  means a claim arising out of one or more of the following               d  agreement relating to the use or hire of any ship whether by charterparty or otherwise     e  agreement relating to the carriage of goods in any ship whether by charterparty or otherwise         Thus  both Gatoil and The  Antonis P Lemos  can be seen as unanimous decisions of the final court of appeal in the United Kingdom interpreting domestic legislation having its origins in an international convention  one aim of which was to bring uniformity of approach among different legal systems  The existence of those decisions  the desirability of international uniformity  or at least broad consistency  and an expressed suggestion by the ALRC  which was heeded  that Parliament follow the wording of the   UK Act  which had been  recently  interpreted  as well as the antecedent provision in the   UK Act  by the House of Lords in Gatoil and The  Antonis P Lemos  necessarily constrain the interpretation of s  f  certainly at first instance  Further  two judges  of this Court  Foster J in The  Bass Reefer  and Gummow J in The  Shin Kobe Maru    at first instance have applied Gatoil   The next question is whether any one or more of these agreements answers or answer the description of   an agreement that relates to the carriage of goods    by a ship   as that phrase was interpreted by the House of Lords in Gatoil   In Gatoil   AC   Lord Keith of Kinkel  with whose speech Lords Fraser of Tullybelton  Scarman  Wilberforce and Roskill agreed  concluded that the phrase  related to  should not be construed widely  but rather there should be  some reasonably direct connection  with the activities described in the provisions  there ss  h  and  e  of the   UK Act    It is also to be noted that the limited approach to the construction of the provision in Gatoil was put forward to the House in The  Antonis P Lemos  as a reason for narrowly construing the phrase  arising out of  in s  h   Lord Brandon dealt with this principally by recognising the textual importance of  arising out of  in the   Convention and demonstrating the clearly unintended consequences of giving that phrase a narrow meaning there and in all the places in the   UK Act and   UK Act where the phrase appears   It is also be noted that in The  Antonis P Lemos  at   Lord Brandon expressed the view that what   tilted the balance in favour of giving a narrow meaning to the expression  relating to   was the existence of two authorities  The  Zeus      PD   and The  Aifanourios    SC    the reasoning in which latter case can be seen as contrary to some of the comments of Lord Brandon about the natural and inevitable overlap in the list of maritime claims   Lord Brandon said  at   AC at   G H  that in the absence of these authorities it might not be right to give the expression  relating to   in s  f   relates to  a narrow meaning as given by the House in Gatoil    For the reasons that I have earlier given  however  it is not appropriate that  sitting at first instance  I do other than apply Gatoil   Further  in what might be said to be in support of a wide construction of  arising out of  and a narrower approach to  relates to  the former expression should be wide to catch all claims that have a connection with an agreement that has the appropriate maritime connection or character  The appropriate maritime connection or character for s  f  might be seen to be assisted by the recognition that all the general maritime claims in Article   of the   Convention and in s   are expressed to be the foundation of an action in rem against a ship and to found the remedy of arrest  The relational connection in the phrase  that relates to  is to be seen in that context  It also may be important to see the appropriate maritime connection by reference to the Constitutional reach of s  iii   Section   must at all times be construed within the confines of the Constitutional authority given to Parliament  cf the Acts Interpretation Act    Cth  s  A   Approaching the matter by applying Gatoil   does or do any one or more of the agreements referred to in   above have a reasonably direct connection with the activity of carriage of goods by a ship and thereby  relates or relate to the carriage of goods by a ship  for s  f  The answer  it seems clear to me  is  yes   As to the first agreement posed  that between the defendant and Planetwide  that agreement was essential to the performance of the sea carriage  The cars had to be loaded into the shipping container in preparation for sea transport  That is what the defendant undertook to do  The loading of the container was  in substance  for the sea carriage  Although the Planetwide bill was not issued until   August   it can be concluded that the agreement between Planetwide and the defendant was in fact to perform obligations which  on the evidence  later  Planetwide undertook in the Planetwide bill to undertake as carrier  The agreement to load the shipping container between the arranger of the carriage and its subcontractor had a reasonably direct relationship with the carriage of goods by the ship citedHewlett Packard Australia Pty Limited v G E Capital Finance Pty Limited     FCR   The second consideration is that provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to courts should be interpreted liberally and without imposing limitations not found in the express words  The  Shin Kobe Maru    CLR at   and see the numerous other High Court authorities to like effect

set out what the evidence discloses of the facts  It should be said at the outset that the issues have been canvassed without a trial and on interlocutory evidence  some of which was unsatisfactory and inadmissible    The jurisdiction of the Court is conferred by laws of the Commonwealth Parliament  The Court only has jurisdiction here if the plaintiff s claim is a general maritime claim under the Act  such that the claim for damages in bailment and tort can be seen as a claim in federal jurisdiction  in the exercise of the Court s Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction  having its source in s  iii  of the Australian Constitution    The evidence is sufficient for me to conclude that the Court has jurisdiction on the basis that the plaintiff s claim is a general maritime claim of the legal character set out in s  f  of the Act  being a claim   arising out of an agreement that relates to the carriage of goods or persons by a ship or to the use or hire of a ship  whether by charterparty or otherwise   citedMathew Short   Associates Pty Limited v Riviera Marine  International  Pty Limited   NSWCA  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  There would be a number of difficult

Whilst there was no argument about the reach of s  iii  of the Constitution before me  as there could not have been without the issue of notices under the Judiciary Act    Cth  s  B    I am fortified in my conclusion that the circumstances here fell within s  f  and thereby necessarily within the reach of s  iii  by reference to Norfolk Southern Railway Co v James N Kirby Pty Limited   US    There the Supreme Court was under no doubt that a dispute arising from a freight forwarder s contract for combined land and sea transportation  the accident happening during railroad carriage in the United

stressed the importance of the background of English legislation and authority and any settled international construction    The Australian legislation having been enacted against the background of English legislation and authority set out above  the definition of  relevant person  should be understood as having the same meaning as the courts had given to the corresponding words in the English statute  When the Parliament has enacted legislation  affecting the subject of international shipping  and followed a statutory precedent from overseas which has by then received a settled

meaning and content of s  f  understood   Mr Cutler for the defendant submitted  in a careful and clear argument  that the claim of the plaintiff did not  arise out of an agreement that relates to the carriage of goods by a ship   First  he stressed that the events in question concerned the loading of the container prior to the land leg of the transportation the carriage to Tilbury  The liability was not said to arise from any contract under which sea carriage would occur  The defendant was merely the sub contractor of Planetwide  which caused damage to the goods while loading the container

out of an agreement  since the claim was pleaded only in bailment and tort  He also submitted that there was an insufficiently direct connection between any relevant agreement  if there were one  out of which the claim arose and the carriage of goods by a ship to satisfy the test laid down in The  Bass Reefer    FCR     Thus  both Gatoil and The  Antonis P Lemos  can be seen as unanimous decisions

was argued initially that these terms bound the plaintiff through the application of the principles in The  Pioneer Container      AC    This argument was abandoned in oral address   There would be a
