Limited     Ch   Allphones also argued that what Mr Lloyd had said in his affidavit could not be read against it  In British Thomson Houston Co Limited v British Insulated and Helsby Cables Limited     Ch   at      see also at     per Atkin LJ  Pollock MR said that affidavits or documents which a party knowingly used as true in a judicial proceeding for the purpose of proving a particular fact are capable of being evidence against that party in subsequent proceedings to prove the same fact  He said that the principle applied in cases where the party adducing the document  whether an affidavit or deposition  knew of its contents beforehand and elected to put it forward in support of the party s case  He referred to what Crompton J had said in Richards v Morgan     B   S   at   namely     It must always be remembered that it is not the obtaining the affidavit or deposition but the making use of it as true with knowledge of the contents  which is the ground on which such evidence is supposed to be receivable      Cockburn CJ in the same case said   B   S at      It cannot be doubted that a man s assertions are admissions  whether made in the course of a judicial proceeding or otherwise  and  in the former case  whether he was himself a party to such proceeding or not  It may be given in evidence against him in any suit or action in which the fact so asserted or admitted becomes material to the issue to be determined  And in principle  there can be no difference whether the assertion or admission be made by the party himself who is sought to be affected by it  or by someone employed  directed or invited by him to make the particular statement on his behalf  In like manner  a man who brings forward another for the purposes of asserting or proving some fact on his behalf  whether in a court of justice or elsewhere  must be taken himself to assert the fact that he thus seeks to establish  referred toChief Executive Officer of Customs v Labrador Liquor Wholesale Pty Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I am of opinion that the definition of  proceeding  in the Federal Court of Australia Act does not affect the construction of  proceeding  as that term is used in the Evidence Act   I am fortified in this view by the recognition that the Evidence Act itself is procedural in substance  It regulates how evidence is to be received and what is admissible  It does not itself create rights or liabilities  That is why the Act is careful to distinguish between various proceedings and to provide rules for the adducing of evidence in them  In Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Labrador Liquor Wholesale Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at     and     Hayne J  with whom Gleeson CJ and McHugh J agreed  said that the rules governing the admissibility of evidence fall under the expression  practice and procedure   Gummow J  with whom Kirby J agreed on this point  said that more substantive rights were involved  Labrador   CLR at      Kirby J referred to the assignment of the burden and identification of a standard of proof as being matters which can be of critical importance to the conduct of a trial  They could thereby partake of certain features of practice and procedure  but he also recognised that each was arguably something more than that because each affected  in a way  the very character of the trial  In that case the provisions of the Excise Act   dealt with how matters might be proved  Labrador   CLR at       Essentially  whether or not a previous representation amounts to an admission is a question of the law of evidence  That question has the character of a matter of practice or procedure  The Evidence Act regulates the way in which a proceeding is conducted  Of course  the Act applies a particular standard of proof depending on whether the proceedings are civil or criminal and in that way the application of the Act may affect substantive rights  But the substantive operation of the Act applies the practice and procedure apposite to regulate the adducing of evidence on each occasion on which it is tendered  The Act does not create any proceeding in a court  Rather  it provides a procedure to apply to or in an existing cause of action or matter for adducing evidence   Proof of what occurred before Tamberlin J is capable of establishing a fact that occurred on an occasion outside this trial  The interlocutory proceeding was not this trial of the issues between the parties  For these reasons  I am of opinion that what occurred before Tamberlin J did not occur in the course of giving evidence in the proceeding in which it is now sought to tender Mr Lloyd s affidavit  It follows that Mr Lloyd s affidavit is capable of being a previous representation and thus capable of falling within the meaning of  admission  as a matter of law appliedDoe d  Wetherell v Bird     C   P   It has long been the law that in civil cases a solicitor has implied authority to make admissions receivable by the Court against his or her client during the actual progress of litigation  either for the purposes of dispensing with proof at trial or in certain other respects  Thus formal admissions made by attorneys of both sides at a first trial could be relied on at the second trial after the first verdict had been set aside  Lord Denman CJ said that there was no doubt that the admissions were receivable at the second trial  albeit that they had been made before  and for the purposes of  the first trial  see Doe d  Wetherell v Bird     C   P   at    And in Langley v Earl of Oxford     LJ Exch   at   Lord Abinger CB held that an admission to be used at the trial of a cause  whenever it should take place  was admissible  It did not matter that the admission had been made before the first trial  Once made  it could be used at the second trial  see also Phipson  The Law of Evidence   th edition    at p   citedDovuro Pty Limited v Wilkins

Management Pty Limited     ALR   at   namely     In general  the passages sought to be tendered as admissions are statements made by counsel appearing in interlocutory matters and intended to be acted upon by the judge  I can see no reason why they should not be regarded as prima facie evidence against the client on whose behalf counsel was addressing the court      Here  of course  Mr Lloyd s

can have no opinions because it has no mind  but it can have attributed to it a state of mind or knowledge based on what those whom it authorises to act on its behalf say or do  Lloyd v David Syme   Co Ltd   AC   at       NSWLR   at   per Lord Keith of Kinkel  For these reasons  I am of opinion that Mr Lloyd was a person whose evidence can be treated as being an admission by Allphones   Next  Allphones argued that the quality of Mr Lloyd s evidence was such that it could not be treated as being an admission of anything  It pointed to the fact that Mr Lloyd did not state his source of knowledge or belief in the affidavit  This is a complaint which does not go to the capacity of the statements to be used as evidence  It merely may go to their weight  albeit that Mr Lloyd s evidence was put forward by Allphones to prove some of the very facts it now says should not be accepted from the same information  The question is whether the representations in pars   and   are capable of showing that before giving its notice of intention to terminate  Allphones had knowledge of the failure of Hoy Mobile to account for receipts from sales of the unlocked phones  As Allphones pointed out the introductory phrase in par    in or around May   is somewhat vague  It also argued that pars   and   of the affidavit are vague in relation to the extent of Allphones  knowledge and the circumstances in which it was obtained referred toLustre Hosiery Limited v York   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I am of opinion that these criticisms do not prevent their reception into evidence of the representations as admissions  In Lustre Hosiery Limited v York   HCA         CLR   at   to   Rich  Dixon  Evatt and McTiernan JJ said     This course of authority seems consistent with the view that words or conduct amount to an admission receivable in evidence against the party if they disclose an intention to affirm or acknowledge the existence of a fact whatever be the party s source of information or belief      In determining whether he intends to affirm or acknowledge the state of facts the party s knowledge or source of information may be immaterial or if he states that another person has told him of it and it appears that he has additional sources of information to the like effect it may be right to understand him as implying a belief in what he repeats or again a person who fails to contradict a statement concerning matters within his own knowledge may be understood as acquiescing in the statement if the circumstances are such as to make it unlikely that he d allow an erroneous statement to pass unchallenged     But although the meaning of his words or conduct may depend upon the state of his knowledge once that meaning appears and an intention is disclosed to assert or acknowledge the state of facts its admissibility in evidence as an admission is independent of the party s actual knowledge of the true facts  When admitted in evidence however its probative force must be determined by reference to the circumstances in which it s made and may depend all together upon the party s source of knowledge      If it appears that he had no knowledge or that although he had some means of knowledge he had formed no certain or considered belief and indicated nothing amounting to a personal judgment or conclusion of his own the probative force of the admission may be so small that a jury ought not be allowed to act upon it alone or in preference to opposing evidence  appliedPrangley v Evans     LR  NSW   L    In Prangley v Evans     NSWLR   at   Owen J  with whom Simpson J  citing the above passage from Cockburn CJ in Richards   B   S at   and Cohen J agreed at     said     A client who uses an affidavit of a

HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Allphones gave Hoy Mobile a notice of its intention to terminate the franchise agreement in late August    Before that occurred  but after Allphones became aware of the allegation of unlocking of the telephones  Hoy Mobile alleges that Allphones acted in a way which affirmed the franchise agreement  Hoy Mobile alleges that Allphones required it to do certain things in accordance with the franchise agreement  Hoy Mobile relies on this affirmation  or election  to deny that Allphones was entitled to terminate the franchise agreement  It claimed that when Allphones sought to require Hoy Mobile to comply with requirements made by it earlier in June and July   that conduct was inconsistent with Allphones  subsequent attempt to exercise a right to terminate  see Sargent v ASL Developments Ltd   HCA         CLR   esp at   per Stephen J   The issue here is whether Allphones knew in June or July   both about the unlocking of the phones and the failure to account  on which it relied  to uphold its exercise of a right to terminate  It gave notice of its intention to exercise the right to terminate in late August     This matter has had a long history of interlocutory case management  During early   a question arose as to whether some documents produced on discovery by Allphones were entitled to be withheld from production on the ground of legal professional privilege  An interlocutory hearing took place before Tamberlin J on   June    At that hearing  Allphones read and relied upon a sworn affidavit by Mr Lloyd on   April    He was a solicitor employed by its solicitors on the record  Mr Lloyd said that he deposed to the matters in the affidavit based on information and belief unless otherwise stated  But  relevantly  he did not identify the sources of the information and belief  Nonetheless  the affidavit was read in full before Tamberlin J followedSmith v Joyce   HCA         CLR
