Moloney v New Zealand  No     FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedLatoudis v Casey   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It is to be observed that s   gives the Court a wide and unstructured discretion  The decision in Latoudis v Casey   HCA         CLR     Latoudis   involved the consideration of such a discretion in relation to prosecution for a summary criminal offence where the defendant had succeeded  The majority stressed the compensatory nature of a costs order and the inadequacy  in the criminal law context  of the fact that the charge was laid in the public interest or that the informant acted reasonably in laying the charge as a reason to deprive the successful defendant of a costs order  per Mason CJ at   Toohey J at   and McHugh J at    Instead  the rule was adopted that in summary criminal matters the successful defendant should be entitled to costs unless there was something in the defendant s own conduct disentitling him or her to costs  per Mason CJ at   Toohey J at   and McHugh J at       That approach appears powerfully persuasive to me  and at least provides some principled basis for the exercise of my discretion  It is the approach that I intend to follow  I do not overlook that these are very serious matters which would be prosecuted on indictment both in New Zealand and Australia  However  the proceedings themselves are auxiliary to intended proceedings on indictment rather than such proceedings themselves  and it seems to me that Latoudis provides the nearest and best guidance that is to be found   I should add that various State legislatures have moved to restrict the benefits to successful defendants which Latoudis would have warranted by structuring and restricting the discretions available to the courts to order costs to successful defendants in criminal cases  and of course  the availability of costs in indictable cases has always been even more restricted   Accordingly  the first respondent is to pay the applicants  costs of the proceedings in this Court   I might add that any dissatisfaction with the outcome may provide another reason for the legislature to re examine the Extradition Act    Cth  as I urge in the principal judgment     I certify that the preceding ten   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Madgwick   Associate Dated    May   Solicitor for the Applicants  Greg Walsh   Co     Counsel for the Respondent  Mr I Bourke SC     Solicitor for the Respondent  Director of Public Prosecutions  Cth      Date of Hearing    May       Date of Judgment    May         AustLII  Copyright Policy   Disclaimers   Privacy Policy   Feedback   URL  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedMoloney v New Zealand   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On the other hand  the Extradition Act    Cth  as explained at length in the reasons for my judgment  see Moloney v New Zealand   FCA     sets its face against any consideration of the underlying merits of the criminal proceedings which the New Zealand prosecuting authorities have sought to bring against the applicants  Apart  therefore  from any time  or costs wasting events that they may have perpetrated  and none is suggested  there is no conduct of the applicants which can fairly be regarded as disentitlement to an order for costs where such an order is otherwise appropriate   The authorities differ as to the nature of proceedings such as these but  in my opinion  whatever their precise juridical nature  the essence of the matter is that the attempt to extradite the applicants  and all subsequent proceedings instituted by the applicants  arise out of an attempt by a responsible government  statutorily regarded as such in Australia  to invoke ordinary criminal processes to vindicate a number of very serious allegations of criminal misconduct   In these circumstances it seems appropriate to me to accord to the New Zealand Government such respect and lack of impediment to enforcing its criminal laws as would be appropriate  in the case of the Australian government  were it subject to a provision such as s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  in relation to criminal proceedings brought by it or its proper manifestation  the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions
