SZMHD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toApplicant NAFF of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlMoreover  this is a case where the entitlement of the appellant to complain of a possible denial of procedural fairness would depend upon whether there was evidence that he was misled  cf Applicant NAFF of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR   at     It seems to me that the finding of the Federal Magistrate  set out at   above  that the appellant responded to the Tribunal without any misapprehension  forecloses the possibility of any valid complaint  Indeed  this is reinforced by the Federal Magistrate s observations  referred to at   above  about the appellant s attempts to mislead the Tribunal  It follows that the appeal must be dismissed with costs   I certify that the preceding sixty one   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson      Associate     Dated    July     The

at         I expressed the view that the effect of the authorities is that the word  considers  in s  A a  is directed at the subjective consideration of the Tribunal on the facts of each case  it is for the court to determine objectively whether the Tribunal considered the information to be dispositively relevant  see also Applicant VEAL of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Another   HCA         CLR   at     The information in the present case was quite different from that which was considered by the High Court in VEAL  In that case  an informant s letter was adverse to the applicant and contained information that was  credible  relevant and significant   Here  the equivocation about Mr Liu s involvement was not of that character  The information that was adverse was that Mr Liu had been held legally responsible for supply false certificates  The appellant was given full opportunity to deal with this referred toKioa v West   HCA         CLR  http www austlii

Citizenship v SZMOK   FCAFC  The question of whether s  B  imposes a substantive obligation of fairness was considered by a Full Court in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZMOK   FCAFC   the decision in which was handed down immediately before the publication of these reasons  The effect of that decision is to dispose of the present appeal adversely to the appellant  This is because the Full Court held at     that s  B  did not qualify the express statement in s  B  that Div   contains an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matters it deals with  As the Full Court said in SZMOK   at   s  B  is not a free standing obligation  it draws content from the other provisions of Div    It therefore cannot require s  A to be interpreted as imposing an obligation not found to exist on the proper construction of that section  Here  there is nothing in s  A which would have required the Tribunal to provide the full text of the email that was supplied to it by the Chinese speaking staff member to the appellant
