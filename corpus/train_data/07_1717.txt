the basis that an appeal does not operate as a stay but that the Court could grant a stay if the Court considers that  in all the circumstances  the matter is an appropriate case for the grant of the stay  The approach adopted by her Honour was undoubtedly right  In Powerflex Services Pty Ltd v Data Access Corporation     FCR   the Full Court of this Court  after observing that O   r   did not limit the broad discretion reposing in the Court  followed a decision of the Court of Appeal in New South Wales in Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corporation Ltd  Receivers Appointed      NSWLR   where it was said at   that it was  sufficient that the applicant for the stay demonstrates a reason or an appropriate case to warrant the exercise of discretion in his favour   In other words  no special or exceptional circumstances need be shown  It is enough to satisfy the Court that the proceeding is one where it is appropriate that the Court exercise its discretion to grant the order referred toBahonko v Sterjov   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   May   during the proceeding before Jessup J and before its determination  the applicant made an oral application for leave to file a statement of charge for contempt against the respondents and their legal representatives and to challenge the competency of two of the witnesses called on behalf of the respondents  amongst other things  Those applications were refused by Jessup J  Bahonko v Sterjov   FCA     On   May   the applicant sought leave to appeal from Jessup J s refusal to grant leave  but on   June   Finkelstein J directed the Registrar that the notice of motion of   May   be refused for filing   In reasons published on   August   that part of the consolidated proceedings seeking relief under the

v Sterjov   FCA    Justice Goldberg decided that there was no need for a stay of the first three orders made by Jessup J  Orders   and   would be considered on appeal  Order   was in the applicant s favour  He considered the applicant s argument that order   be stayed  but rejected a stay because the order simply required the parties to file and serve submissions on costs  His Honour was not prepared to interfere with the trial process  He said that if an adverse costs order was made against the applicant she could appeal and  if it were appropriate  seek an order for a stay  In his reasons  Goldberg J rejected the applicant s very serious complaints about the trial judge and the respondents  legal advisers  which he described as being without basis and unsupported by the evidence   The first notice of motion challenged Jessup J s orders for costs and sought other relief including access to transcript  The second notice of motion purported to be an application for leave to appeal from Goldberg J s decision of   August   refusing to stay Jessup J s orders of   August   and consequential relief   The amended notice of motion for hearing before me seeks the following orders       Appellant is given leave to appeal from the orders NO    and   given by Justice Gordon on   October   and a part of the order   which part is not granting appellant an access to

October   in VID   and paragraphs       applies to this leave   those orders are treated as if given in VID          Defamatory of the appellant parts of the reasons for judgments given by Justice Gordon on   are removed  replaced with corrective statements and apology statements and damages are paid to the appellant by the Federal Court of Australia        Mr McKenney and Mr F Vitiello are

VID          Justice Gordon is suspended from her office having engaged in a wilful and criminal defamation of the appellant in VID     At the hearing the applicant sought to and was given leave to amend paragraph   by deleting reference to the Federal Court of Australia and by deleting paragraph   and substituting         Justice Gordon is directed to review her reasons for judgment in proceedings VID        Those two amendments were made during her address to the Court on   November     Paragraph   of the notice of motion before me seeks leave to appeal from Gordon J s orders on the first notice of motion  Paragraphs   to   seek consequential orders on the assumption that the leave sought in paragraph   be granted  Paragraph   seeks leave to appeal from Gordon J s orders dismissing the applicant s application by a second notice of motion for leave to appeal from Goldberg J s refusal to grant a stay of Jessup J s orders  Paragraph   is a similar application to that for which Jessup J refused leave during the trial and dismissed by Gordon J in the first notice of motion  Paragraphs   and    even as amended  are scandalous  Paragraph   is misconceived  I will deal with each of these paragraphs in turn below   The applicant has raised three separate issues within paragraph   of the notice of motion before me   I will first deal with that part of paragraph   which complains of Gordon J s refusal to order that the applicant have access to the whole of the transcript at trial   I should note that  before Gordon J  the applicant sought transcript from proceedings VID   and VID   which were the proceedings before Jessup J  As noted above  however  Jessup J consolidated those two proceedings  such that the applicant s complaints were all heard as matter VID    It was under that proceeding that Jessup J made orders in relation to both the substantive proceedings and costs   Justice Gordon gave the applicant access to an electronic form of the transcript of the witnesses at the trial  It is not clear what other transcript is sought  The applicant mentions in her affidavit that she does not have access to the transcript before Goldberg J and Gordon J but that transcript  if it exists  is not evidence and could not be remotely relevant on the appeal or  indeed  on this application  I will assume that the applicant is seeking that part of the transcript before Jessup J not subject to the order made by Gordon J  I will assume that the applicant could appeal from Gordon J s refusal to order that the further transcript be made available  although I doubt that the order is appealable   However  even upon those assumptions the order sought should not be made  It has not been demonstrated that the transcript of what was said during the trial and was not evidence is relevant  Even if it were relevant  Gordon J s order does not prevent the applicant accessing the transcript  The applicant can  if she orders the transcript and pays the fee  have a copy of the transcript  Justice Gordon s order simply means that the Court will not be put to the cost of providing to the applicant a transcript of that part of the proceeding which does not contain evidence and has not been shown to be relevant  Insofar as leave is sought to appeal from the refusal of Gordon J to order that a transcript be made available to the applicant  it is refused   In paragraph   of the current notice of motion  the applicant also seeks leave to appeal from order   made by Gordon J on   October   on the first notice of motion   The application before Gordon J sought the stay of the costs order made by Jessup J on   August   until the appeal was determined  Order   made by Gordon J on the first notice of motion dismissed the other orders sought in the notice of motion which had the effect that the applicant s application for a stay of Jessup J s costs order was dismissed  It also had the effect of dismissing the application in the notice of motion that the respondents  step down  from representing the respondents  Leave to appeal is sought from that order   Justice Gordon was asked to consider the question of a stay in relation to costs in circumstances where Goldberg J had considered and refused a stay of the substantive orders made by Jessup J  Justice Goldberg was not prepared to interfere with the trial process and stay Jessup J s order which required the parties to file and serve submissions on costs   When the matter came before Gordon J the applicant had already amended her notice of appeal to add grounds of appeal against the costs orders made by Jessup J on   August     Before Gordon J the applicant asserted that Jessup J s orders contravened the WRA and that  t here were and are not any costs due against me   She claimed in her affidavit that the  manner of the orders given by Justice Jessup on   August   further demonstrate that those orders are unreasonable   if remain would constitute abuse of the process and continuation of a fraud   She also alleged that his reasons constituted  multiple wilful misrepresentations  defamations and vilification of me       She criticised other aspects of Jessup J s reasons  Putting aside the inappropriate language  the reasons advanced may have been relevant as to whether the order for costs should have remained or were to be reviewed on appeal  However  Gordon J was not hearing an appeal but an interlocutory application for a stay  No ground was advanced why it was appropriate that the orders be stayed   There was no evidence before Gordon J that the taxation of the respondents  costs was imminent or was likely to occur prior to the hearing of the appeal in relation to the substantive matter  That of itself would have been sufficient reason for Gordon J to dismiss the application because no need was demonstrated for the order sought  Justice Gordon  however  dismissed the application because the primary matter of substance advanced in support of the application was that  t here were and are not any costs due against me   Justice Gordon said that was an issue for the appeal  Her Honour s decision was undoubtedly correct  The matters raised by the applicant might be relevant to the appeal before the Full Court but were not relevant to the stay application   Justice Gordon described the additional matters relied on by the applicant as  scandalous and vexatious  being allegations of criminal conduct and conduct constituting abuse of office which were  unsupported and insupportable   I agree with those observations   There is a further reason to refuse leave  If leave were granted the appeal against Gordon J s refusal to grant a stay would be  assuming the other orders sought by the applicant were granted  heard at the same time as the appeal against the substantive orders and the appeal against costs  The purpose of a stay prior to the hearing of the appeal would not be achieved  It follows that an order granting leave to appeal against Gordon J s refusal to grant a stay would be futile in those circumstances   If the Full Court is of the opinion that the appeal against either the substantive orders or the costs orders is likely to succeed it can  on the applicant s application or its own motion  make an order for a stay   Order   of her Honour s order on this notice of motion also had the effect of dismissing the applicant s application that the respondents  legal representatives step down  Her Honour dismissed that application on the ground that the allegations made in support of the notice of motion were without foundation and scandalous  I have studied the allegations contained in the applicant s affidavit sworn on   September   which was the affidavit relied upon by the applicant before Gordon J and the affidavit sworn on   October   in support of this notice of motion before me  I agree with her Honour in both respects  The allegations are without foundation and scandalous  I make these comments notwithstanding the vitriolic comments made by the applicant in respect of Gordon J s comments to the same effect   Leave to appeal must be refused because her Honour s decision is not attended by any doubt and  moreover  no injustice would be suffered by the applicant if leave were refused   In Order   of the notice of motion before her  Gordon J ordered the applicant to pay the respondents  costs  Such an order was inevitable having regard to the order made refusing the stay  Insofar as this notice of motion seeks leave to appeal from her Honour s order for costs  it should be dismissed   Paragraphs       and   of the notice of motion would only need to be considered if  contrary to my opinion  leave ought to be granted from Gordon J s decision in relation to orders   and   and part of order   of the orders made by Gordon J on   October    The applications made under these paragraphs must also be dismissed   The order sought in paragraph   of the notice of motion is somewhat different  That application seeks leave to appeal from the decision of Gordon J in VID   also given on   October   which related to a second notice of motion before her Honour  The orders which were sought in that proceeding are set out at   above   Her Honour dismissed that notice of motion  Because her Honour refused leave to appeal from the orders of Goldberg J of   August   she was also bound to dismiss paragraphs     and   of the notice of motion which sought orders consequential upon the applicant obtaining leave   The applicant now seeks leave to appeal from Gordon J s refusal to grant leave to appeal from Goldberg J s order refusing a stay of the order in the substantive proceedings made by Jessup J on   August     For reasons which follow  the application is misconceived  But not only is the application misconceived it is pointless and a waste of the Court s resources and a burden upon the respondents   Justice Goldberg refused a stay of Jessup J s orders of   August   for the reasons recited in   of these reasons  He was undoubtedly right  There was no practical utility in granting a stay order when orders   and   dismissed the applicant s proceeding and order   was in the applicant s favour  There was nothing in those orders to stay  He refused to order a stay of order   made by Jessup J  That order is no longer relevant as further orders have been made  Those further orders have already been addressed in respect of paragraph   of this notice of motion   But even if there were a need for a stay order and even if I had power to grant leave to appeal from Gordon J s refusal to grant leave  which I do not  the order sought would be pointless  Like the application in paragraph   if leave were granted the appeal against Goldberg J s refusal to grant a stay would be heard at the same time as the appeal against the substantive orders  If that were the case  there would be no stay pending the appeal  It follows that the application is pointless for that further reason   However  in any event  the application for leave to appeal from Gordon J s order refusing leave to appeal from Goldberg J is misconceived   Justice Gordon s refusal to grant leave to appeal from Goldberg J was an exercise by her Honour of the Court s appellate jurisdiction pursuant to s  A  and s  a  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   Section   of the Act gives the Court jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals from judgments of the Court constituted by a single judge  s  a   However  s  A  requires that where the judgment is an interlocutory judgment the appellant first obtain leave to appeal from the Court or a judge  Section  a  provides that an application for leave to appeal may be heard and determined by a single judge or the Full Court  Order   rule  AA of the Rules provides that an application under s   should be heard by a single judge unless one of the events in the rule occurs   This application for leave to appeal must therefore be dismissed as incompetent  Because no appeal lies from Gordon J s refusal to grant leave to appeal  it follows that no appeal lies from her Honour s refusal to make the second and third orders in the second notice of motion before her Honour which  as I have said  were consequential upon the applicant being granted leave   The fourth order sought in the notice of motion before Gordon J  insofar as it sought to impugn Finkelstein J s direction  was again  with respect  misconceived  Justice Finkelstein made a direction pursuant to O   r  A b  of the Rules that the Registrar refuse for filing the notice of motion seeking leave to appeal from Jessup J s decision not to grant leave to file the statement of charge for contempt   The applicant has filed applications before Finkelstein J  Goldberg J  Gordon J and now me in which she has successively made complaints about the conduct of judges of this Court and of the legal practitioners representing the respondents  Latitude is given to unrepresented parties because sometimes they may have difficulty in understanding the Court s processes  Sometimes unrepresented parties become very involved in the processes and express themselves infelicitously  However  there comes a time when the Court must  for the purpose of maintaining the dignity of the Court and the public s confidence in the Court  say enough is enough  That stage has been reached  The applicant must understand that  if she continues to make unsubstantiated allegations of the kind in the application  affidavits and draft notices of appeal which scandalise the Court  action may need to be taken for the protection of the Court  I have considered whether it might be appropriate to take action in this proceeding  However  the applicant has not previously been warned that her conduct may be considered to be a contempt of the Court  I have therefore determined that on this application she should be given this warning   I certify that the
