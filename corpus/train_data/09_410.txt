htmlI note that in Re Narla Prospecting Proprietary Limited  Dallhold Investments Proprietary Limited v Narla Prospecting Proprietary Limited   FCA         ACLC     French J  when a member of this Court  in deciding at the behest of a holding company to wind up a subsidiary  appointed as liquidator of the subsidiary the person who was the liquidator of the holding company  That also was a case where his Honour concluded that the company should be wound up on the just and equitable ground  I also bear in mind that Messrs Worrell and Khatri are well experienced liquidators  I confidently expect that in the event that such potential  and I consider it remote  as there is for conflict of interest does arise  that that will be the subject of application in short order to the Court by them  I am satisfied that it is appropriate that they be appointed as liquidators of Victorian Families  My attention has been drawn to an interesting and  perhaps  inconsistent position in the Act in respect of circumstances where more than one liquidator is appointed  Section   provides    If more than one liquidator is appointed by the court  the court must declare whether anything that is required or authorised by this Act be done by the liquidator is to be done by all or any one or more of the persons appointed consideredStorm Financial Limited  Receivers and Managers Appointed

cases cth FCA  htmlIn the matter of Storm Financial Limited  Receivers and Managers Appointed   Administrators Appointed  Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Storm Financial Limited  Receivers and Managers Appointed   Administrators Appointed    FCA   at     I canvassed both learned academic authority as well as judicial decisions relating to the history and nature of the jurisdiction to wind up a company on the just and equitable ground  I shall not repeat what I there stated  It suffices to note that the just and equitable ground is one which provides for a very broad basis indeed upon which a company may be wound up  Further  it is neither necessary nor desirable to seek to place limits on language which Parliament has made deliberately broad in its purview  That said  Parliament has chosen  in a case where a winding up application is made by a contributory  to specify  in s   some relevant considerations  That subsection is in these terms    Where the application is made by members as contributories on the ground that it is just and equitable that the company should be wound up or that the directors have acted in a manner that appears to be unfair or unjust to other members  the court  if it is of the opinion that       a  the applicants are entitled to relief either by winding up the company or by some other means  and      b  in the absence of any other remedy it would be just and equitable that the company should be wound up      must make a winding up order unless it also of the opinion that some other remedy is available to the applicants and that they are acting unreasonably in seeking to have the company wound up instead of pursuing that other remedy  The salient facts are these  Victorian Families remains in the position of being without any directors  Further  there are no persons who are willing to act as directors  But for the appointment of the provisional liquidators  Victorian Families would  in all likelihood  remain what one might describe as  a rudderless ship   Victorian Families is not trading  Indeed  having regard to the absence of any disposition prior to the appointment of the provisional liquidators to fill the vacancy in the office of director and  further  having regard to the placement of the parent company into administration and  more latterly  into liquidation  there is a compelling inference that those who ultimately controlled Victorian Families prior to the appointment of external administration made a conscious decision to abandon its business and the management of that company  Victorian Families is in the following present financial position  It has   a  unpaid trade creditors of between   and      b  outstanding liabilities to the Commonwealth in respect of taxation debts of      c  outstanding superannuation liabilities in respect of employees of   and other employee entitlement liabilities of      d  assets comprising   i  a bank account balance in credit to the extent of   and an indebtedness owed by Storm Financial to it of        Additionally  Victorian Families is presently subject to the contingency of claims in respect of margin loan losses by former clients  In some instances that contingency has become manifest  in others  claims are anticipated  One client has made a claim for   in relation to up front fees paid to Victorian Families  The provisional liquidator s assessment is that more such claims are likely  In addition  Victorian Families has received notice of impending professional disciplinary proceedings
