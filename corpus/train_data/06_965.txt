Seymour v Migration Agents Registration Authority   FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toA Solicitor v Law Society  NSW    HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Mr Seymour submitted that the reasoning of the tribunal as set out in paragraph   and the first sentence of paragraph   of its reasons  see   demonstrated that the tribunal had failed in its statutory task of assessing the subjective and objective circumstances of Mr Seymour s offending behaviour in the way explained by the High Court in A Solicitor v Law Society  NSW    HCA         CLR   at             That submission was based on characterizing the tribunal s reasoning that Mr Seymour s history of having been struck off as a solicitor in   having given the undertaking to the Supreme Court that he would not in future act or purport to act as a solicitor in   and his   conviction and sentence for contempt were facts which   alone would be sufficient to render  Mr Seymour  not a fit and proper person whether the contempt was criminal or civil    see   of the tribunal s reasons    The Authority submitted that the tribunal had been referring in this passage of its reasoning to the earlier findings which it had set out recounting the nature of the proceedings leading up to Buddin J s decision and his Honour s findings in that decision  including matters that were set out in the decision but not necessarily referred to directly in the tribunal s reasons  The Authority said that there was a number of freestanding findings by the tribunal each of which would justify its ultimate conclusion  first  the findings which I have just set out  secondly  the findings relating to Mr Seymour s change of position as to whether contempt was a criminal offence depending on whether he was before the Court of Appeal or the tribunal  see     of the tribunal s reasons   above   Thus the Authority argued that even if the tribunal had been wrong to take account of the balance of material referred to in   of its reasons  having concluded that by reference to the matters in   alone  Mr Seymour was not a fit and proper person  that was a finding of fact on the merits in respect of which there was no error of law   And  the tribunal s reasons show that it did examine  the whole position  A Solicitor v Law Society  NSW    HCA         CLR   at       Despite Mr Seymour s submissions  I am not satisfied that the tribunal made any error of law in approaching its task of making an evaluation of the particular facts and circumstances before it concerning him and in making its decision as to its satisfaction under s    The tribunal considered the detailed subjective and objective circumstances of Mr Seymour s offending behaviour  cf    CLR at     in the context of the whole of its reasons  before expressing its conclusion at      The tribunal is not obliged to set out every detail of its reasoning process   Re Ruddock  Ex parte S      ALR   at     per Gummow and Heydon JJ  Gleeson CJ agreeing at     applying Commissioner for Australilan Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd     FCR   at    There Northrop  Miles and French JJ held that a decision maker could rely on an obvious and natural evaluation of admitted facts to decide that an applicant was not a fit and proper person    It was open to the tribunal to have regard to Mr Seymour not explaining why he consented to injunctions   years after his striking off that he would not act as a solicitor  Again  it was open to the tribunal to see this lack of explanation  in combination with the other matters it took into account in     as revelatory of integrity and of fitness and propriety  just as in In Re Davis     CLR   and see too A Solicitor v Law Society  NSW    HCA         CLR   at             Moreover  the underlying facts of the   injunction were relevant  The tribunal had earlier found   that Mr Seymour was vague when asked to recount them referred toACCC v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Although their Honours referred to the  common law of Australia  that law derives its unity through the role of the High Court under s   of the Constitution which enables that Court to harmonize differences in the earlier common laws of the various States by establishing common principles  see e g  Mabo v Queensland  No     HCA         CLR   at     per Brennan J  ACCC v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     per Gummow and Hayne JJ  Blunden v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at     per Kirby J   Nonetheless  the source of that  common law of Australia  in relation to the inherent power of the Supreme Court of New South Wales to punish for contempt of court can only be the common law of that State  because  as the Native Title Case     CLR at   held  the Commonwealth itself has no such source referred toAl Kateb v Godwin   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  While in centuries gone by it may have been legally possible to imprison people who owed but had not paid debts  imprisonment in Australia today can only occur where a person is sentenced to a term by a court pursuant to law  be it a statute or the unwritten law  or is remanded  or held for a very limited time before he or she must be brought before a court or a justice of the peace  cf  Williams v The Queen   HCA         CLR   in custody as incident of the administration of the criminal law so as to be available at his or her trial  Administrative detention is not imprisonment   Al Kateb v Godwin   HCA         CLR   and some statutes can authorize preventative detention after a term of imprisonment has been served  cf  Fardon v Attorney General  Qld    HCA         ALR     ALJR   Baker v The Queen   HCA         ALR     ALJR   Kable v DPP  NSW    HCA         CLR    As Salmon LJ remarked in Jennison v Baker     QB   at  G  of the distinction between  civil  and  criminal  contempt     I think that  at any rate today  this is an unhelpful and almost meaningless classification      see too per John Laws  then junior counsel to the Treasury  in  Current Problems in the Law of Contempt     Current Legal Prolems   at     quoted in Aldridge Eady   Smith on Contempt   rd ed  at     referred toAttorney General  NSW  v Whiley     NSWLR   The Tribunal then proceeded to consider whether the proceedings before Buddin J could be described as having resulted in a conviction for a criminal offence  It referred to a number of authorities to which I will have to refer in due course  including Attorney General  NSW  v Whiley     NSWLR   Whitham v Holloway   HCA         CLR   and Australasian Meat Industry Employees  Union v Mudginberri Pty Limited   HCA         CLR    The Tribunal concluded that there was no doubt that proceedings before Buddin J had been brought with the purpose of punishing Mr Seymour noting that it had been common ground  as Buddin J recorded in his reasons  that the provisions of the Crimes  Sentencing Procedure  Act    NSW  applied and that the penalty imposed had been one of imprisonment for a fixed term  as opposed to an indefinite term until the contempt of being purged  The tribunal then said       Therefore whilst not free from doubt  I accept for current purposes that the contempt proceedings before Buddin J were criminal         The result of that finding has application to both subparagraphs     and     of the Respondent s Statement of Facts and Contentions   The Authority submitted that the reasoning in Re Colina  Ex parte Torney   HCA         CLR   did not affect the construction of s  e  despite the fact that this might mean that similar wording in that section would create different results were the contempt alleged one that had been determined in a court established under Ch III of the Constitution   This result was supported because it was said that a law of a State could include that State s common law and its statute law  including ss   and   of the Supreme Court Act    NSW  and the fact that in Attorney General v Whitley     NSWLR   at  A D  to which Buddin J had referred  it appeared that the finding of guilt in effect of the charge of contempt was a conviction of the criminal offence   The tribunal referred  at   to Buddin J s reference   NSWSC     to Attorney General  NSW  v Whiley     NSWLR   at  B C where Clarke  Meagher and Handley JJA said that a conviction for contempt was a conviction for an offence which is criminal in nature  However  the Court of Appeal was dealing with a case in which the contempts alleged were  if proved   criminal  on any view because they amounted to interferences in the course of justice by improperly attempting to influence a judicial officer hearing a matter and bringing improper pressure to bear on a party to that matter   The Court of Appeal there held   NSWLR at  C D  that the provisions of the Sentencing Act    NSW  applied to a conviction for contempt  Mr Seymour argued that such a conviction cannot become spent under Pt VIIC of the Crimes Act    Cth  within the meaning of s  c  of the Act  However  the conviction is either of a criminal offence or it is not  whatever the provisions of Pt VIIC may provide   Under s  ZM b  of the Crimes Act    Cth  a conviction for an offence is spent at the end of   years after conviction if a person is not sentenced to imprisonment at all or if the sentence is for less than   months  In s  ZL  State law  is defined as meaning      a law in force in a State  other than a Commonwealth law  and  State offence  as meaning      an offence against a State law   In contrast  in s  ZL    Commonwealth law  is defined by reference to an Act  an instrument or other legislation  I am of opinion that the definition of  State law  is intended to include the unwritten law of the States and Territories as well as written laws referred toAttorney General  NSW  v X   NSWCA         NSWLR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  Aldridge  Eady   Smith on Contempt   rd ed  at     suggest that notwithstanding the views of those who advocate abandoning the distinction between  civil  and  criminal  contempt  over the course of years many practical distinctions have occurred which would require explanation were this course to be followed  I do not think this is a sufficient justification  A convicted contemnor s rights of appeal could be protected  quickly  by amending legislation  cp the introduction and amendment of s  A of the Supreme Court Act    NSW  where the Attorney General of that State is given the right to refer to the Court of Appeal questions of law arising out of an acquittal on a charge of contempt  see  Attorney General  NSW  v X   NSWCA         NSWLR   and John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Attorney General  NSW    NSWCA         ALR     FLR   referred toAttorney General  NSW  v John Fairfax   Sons Ltd     NSWLR   Nowadays  all charges of contempt are invariably heard by a judge or a full court sitting on a summary trial  The procedure for trial by jury of such a charge or indictment has fallen into desuetude   Director of Public Prosecutions v Australian Broadcasting Corporation     NSWLR   at  A D per Street CJ  Hope  Glass  Samuels and Priestly JJA  In re Lonrho Plc     AC   at  B C  Re Colina  Ex parte Torney   HCA         CLR   at         Borrie   Lowe  The Law of Contempt   rd ed  p    In Attorney General  NSW  v John Fairfax   Sons Ltd     NSWLR   at  C E McHugh JA referred to Rex v Tibbits     KB   as the last reported case in England of a trial for contempt on indictment and he said there had not been such a trial in New South Wales in the twentieth century   The current mode of proceeding for criminal contempt by the summary procedure is the product of historical development  Whatever procedure be employed to prosecute a charge of criminal contempt  in my opinion  cannot change the essential nature of that charge from being a criminal charge  As McHugh JA pointed out in Attorney General  NSW  v John Fairfax   Sons Ltd     NSWLR   at  E  E  the overwhelming preference has been in recent times to use the summary procedure and its utilization need not be justified  unlike attempts in the past to do so  As he said   NSWLR at  E       the summary procedure is a departure from the ordinary course of law for criminal proceedings    But that procedure does not change the character or incidents of criminal contempt from being at common law a criminal offence  Lord Russell of Killowen CJ explained the then state of the law in Reg v Gray     QB   at     saying that the summary jurisdiction was      not a new fangled jurisdiction  it is a jurisdiction as old as the common law itself  of which it forms part    But his Lordship pointed out at that time it was exercised      only when the case is clear and beyond reasonable doubt  and where that feature were not present he said that the courts left it to the Attorney General to decide whether to proceed by criminal information  i e  indictment  see R v Hull     NSWLR    The reporter noted in Reg v Gray     QB at   that the procedure then used was to issue an order on the Crown side of the Queen s Bench Division directing the accused to appear and show cause why he or she should not be committed for contempt as laid out in affidavits  see Onslow s and Whalley s Case     LR   QB   at     see too Skipworth s Case   LR   QB   at   per Blackburn J referred toAttorney General v Newspaper Publishing plc   Ch   at   In Attorney General v Newspaper Publishing Plc   Ch   at   Lloyd LJ tellingly observed that it was nonsensical for the law to classify as a criminal a stranger to the litigation who aided and abetted a party bound by an injunction to breach the injunction  while leaving the principal not as a criminal at all but as only  guilty  of  civil  contempt  He would have classified each as  civil   In contrast  Sir John Donaldson MR also found the classification between civil and criminal contempt no longer to be appropriate and suggested an  apparently criminal classification   Ch at  B D  see too  Borrie   Lowe   The Law of Contempt   rd ed  pp      Of course  Gibbs CJ  Mason  Wilson and Deane JJ had debunked the example of the stranger being liable on a different standard as  an absurd

Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Tribunal then proceeded to consider whether the proceedings before Buddin J could be described as having resulted in a conviction for a criminal offence  It referred to a number of authorities to which I will have to refer in due course  including Attorney General  NSW  v Whiley     NSWLR   Whitham v Holloway   HCA         CLR   and Australasian Meat Industry Employees  Union v Mudginberri Pty Limited   HCA         CLR    The Tribunal concluded that there was no doubt that proceedings before Buddin J had been

applied and that the penalty imposed had been one of imprisonment for a fixed term  as opposed to an indefinite term until the contempt of being purged  The tribunal then said       Therefore whilst not free from doubt  I accept for current purposes that the contempt proceedings before Buddin J were criminal         The result of that finding has application to both subparagraphs     and     of the Respondent s Statement of Facts and Contentions   Nonetheless  the distinction had been recognized in the High Court as recently as Australasian Meat Industry Employees  Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     The reliance on the distinction in a case like the present  where the applicant was sentenced to nine months imprisonment  suspended  for breaching a court order shows how unworkable the distinction really is in practice  Was the contempt with which the applicant was charged civil when the charge was preferred  Did it remain so or did it transmute  as the seriousness of  and contumaciousness of  his conduct was proved in evidence or found by Buddin J when giving judgment  The very notion that an allegation of contempt can have such a chameleon like character demonstrated  in Australasian Meat Industry Employees  Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     and in Witham v Holloway   HCA         CLR   that all such cases had to be decided on the criminal standard of proof  The High Court did not have to decide in the latter case whether the distinction between  civil  and  criminal  contempt should be abolished  see   CLR at     The elusiveness of the distinction Windeyer J identified is demonstrated by the result in Witham v Holloway   HCA         CLR    There the question was what standard of proof applied  i e  civil or criminal  in proceedings which fell squarely within Lord Atkinson s  civil  classification  namely  charges of contempt that the appellant knowingly or recklessly presented a false or misleading statement of his assets and liabilities in an affidavit which he had been ordered to make and that he breached  what was then termed  a Mareva injunction   this is now known as a Mareva order  Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at           by dealing with his assets contrary to the terms  Brennan  Deane  Toohey and Gaudron JJ said   CLR at        Given that purpose or object cannot readily be disentangled from effect and given  also  that a penal or disciplinary jurisdiction may be called into play in proceedings alleging breach of an order or undertaking  it is necessary to acknowledge  as it was in Mudginberri     HCA       CLR   at   that punitive and remedial objects are  in the words of Salmon LJ  inextricably intermixed    Jennison v Baker     QB   at        Moreover and  perhaps  of more importance  nothing is achieved by describing some proceedings as   punitive   and others as   remedial or coercive    Punishment is punishment  whether it is imposed in vindication or for remedial or coercive purposes  And there can be no doubt that imprisonment and the imposition of fines  the usual sanctions for contempt  constitute punishment  And the same is true of a sequestration made in consequence of a company s failure to comply with an order or undertaking   More recently in Rich v ASIC   HCA         CLR   at             six justices referred to the difficulties in attempting to classify all proceedings as either civil or criminal  They noted the elusive distinction between  punitive and  protective  proceedings  And in Australasian Meat Industry Employees  Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     Gibbs CJ  Mason  Wilson and Deane JJ said that lying behind punishment for a contempt which involves wilful disobedience to a court order is the very substantial purpose of disciplining the defendant and vindicating the authority of the court  They held that a deliberate commission or omission which is in breach of an injunctive order or undertaking would constitute such wilful disobedience unless it were casual  accidental or unintentional  They said   CLR at   that such a deliberate commission or omission         went beyond a matter of mere civil contempt there opening up     a jurisdiction in the Federal Court to adopt such measures in its discretion  whether punitive or coercive  which would best deal with the contempt   In Attorney General v Newspaper Publishing Plc   Ch   at   Lloyd LJ tellingly observed that it was nonsensical for the law to classify as a criminal a stranger to the litigation who aided and abetted a party bound by an injunction to breach the injunction  while leaving the principal not as a criminal at all but as only  guilty  of  civil  contempt  He would have classified each

an absurd proposition  in Australasian Meat Industry Employees  Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     For my part  were I free to do so  I would regard all contempts which interfere with the course of justice or the due administration of the law   Lane v Registrar of Supreme Court of NSW   HCA         CLR   at     Australasian Meat Industry Employees  Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   as criminal offences because they denote a qualification or impediment on  e g  contempts by publication which can be unknowing  or a refusal to obey the lawful authority of the Court  When the Court enjoins a person from acting in a particular way  it is undoubtedly saying that it will be a breach of the law so to act thereafter  Why  when the person breaches the injunction is his or her behaviour any less serious or different in character than a breach of a statutory prohibition to which criminal sanctions also attach  A person charged with contempt should never be exposed to the duplicitous  almost schizophrenic  nature of a charge of  civil  contempt which  during the course of the hearing may change into a  criminal  charge  No other court proceedings allow of such an intolerable situation  It is unfair to the point of being unjust that a person defending proceedings does not know at the outset of the hearing the full nature of the case against him or her where liberty may be in jeopardy  cf  Australasian Meat Industry Employees  Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at       Accordingly  I must decide whether Mr Seymour was found by Buddin J to have acted contumaciously in breach of the injunction  A  civil  contempt can become  criminal  where the act charged is contumacious in the sense that in doing it there was a direct intention to disobey the order   Witham v Holloway   HCA         CLR   at   per McHugh J citing Warrington J s well known dictum in Stancomb v Trowbridge Urban Council

Tribunal v Bond   HCA         CLR   at   referred toAustralian Building and Construction and Builders Labourers  Federation v David Syme   Co Ltd     FLR   The significance of their Honours  judgment is that in cases of  criminal contempt  all such contempts are indictable misdemeanours at common law but are also capable of being punishable summarily  That result followed from the undelivered judgment of Wilmot J in R v Almon   Wilm     ER   see too  James v Robinson   HCA         CLR   at        An indictable misdemeanour was triable as an ordinary criminal offence  on indictment before a jury  see Rex v Tibbits     KB   at    It is a common law criminal offence which was once described by Lindley LJ as      the only offence that I know of which is punishable at common law by summary process    O Shea v O Shea   Parnell     PD   at   cited with approval in Australian Building and Construction and Builders  Labourers  Federation v David Syme   Co Ltd     FLR   at     ALR   at     And it must follow that where the misdemeanour is punished by summary process  it is no less a punishment that follows conviction for a criminal offence   The Full Court of this court has held in Australian Building Construction Employees  and Builders Labourers  Federation v David Syme   Co Ltd     FLR     ALR   that the court had no jurisdiction to hear an appeal against a verdict of acquittal on the merits on a charge of criminal contempt  That case had applied an earlier decision of a Full Court in Thompson v Mastertouch TV Service Pty Ltd  No       FLR     ALR   which had held that the court under s  a  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  had no jurisdiction to hear an appeal against a verdict of acquittal on the merits of a criminal charge  This line of authority was subsequently approved in Davern v Messel   HCA         CLR    see esp at   per Mason and Brennan JJ   As Bowen CJ  Evatt and Deane JJ pointed out in Australian Building Construction and Builders  Labourers  Federation v David Syme   Co Ltd     FLR   at     ALR   at      A finding of guilt of criminal contempt is a  conviction   see Izuora v R   AC   at     of an  offence   see Shamadasani v King Emperor   AC at   at    so grave an offence as contempt of court   In Re James W Thompson     VLR   the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria  Williams  Holroyd and Hood JJ  held that an appeal against an order attaching the appellant for contempt of court in publishing certain articles in a newspaper commenting on pending proceedings was incompetent for the reason that the proceedings for attachment were  a criminal matter  and therefore there is no appeal to this court   Their Honours commented that the purported appeal was  virtually an appeal from a punishment inflicted by a judge presiding in the criminal court for a criminal offence   see  also  the equally strong comments of Cussen J in Re Dunn   VLR   at      Acquittal of a charge of criminal contempt

was contended that these cases show that the disobedience of an order of Court constitutes in itself a crime  a criminal contempt of Court  Unfortunately for this contention  however  they do something more than that  they show I think  conclusively  that if a person be expressly enjoined by injunction  a most solemn and authoritative form of order  from doing a particular thing  and he deliberately in breach of that injunction  does that thing  he is not guilty of any crime whatever  but only of a civil contempt of Court    AC at p    And in New South Wales  more than sixty years ago Walker J  spoke of  the mistaken view that all the offences generically known as contempts stand on the same footing  and that all contempts are criminal and must be dealt with as though they were the subject of a criminal indictment    This  he said   is not so   Dealing with an application for the sequestration of the property of a trade union that had disobeyed an injunction he said   This is not an application by the plaintiff that the Court should exercise its criminal jurisdiction  and punish the union for a criminal offence  it is a step in the suit by which the plaintiff endeavours  by the only means open to him  to enforce against the union the injunction of the Court  Keogh v  The Australian Workers  Union     SR Eq  NSW    at pp       Accordingly  I must decide whether Mr

CLR   at   and see too per Toohey  Gaudron and Gummow JJ at     Chew v The Queen   HCA         CLR   at      The modern approach in construing penal statutes was stated by Gibbs J   as he then was  in Beckwith v  The Queen     HCA       CLR   at   as follows           The rule formerly accepted  that statutes creating offences are to be strictly construed  has lost much of its importance in modern times  In determining the meaning of a penal statute the ordinary rules of construction must be applied  but if the language of the statute remains ambiguous or doubtful the ambiguity or doubt may be resolved in favour of the subject by refusing to extend the category of criminal offences  see R  v  Adams     HCA       CLR   at pp      Craies on Statute Law    th ed    pp       The rule is perhaps one of last resort           In the course of argument  the question arose whether the two principles of interpretation to which we have referred  ie a purposive interpretation which furthered industrial safety and the rule that penal provisions should be strictly construed  come into conflict in the present case and if so  how the conflict is to be resolved  If such a conflict was to arise  the court must proceed with its primary task of extracting the intention of the legislature from the fair meaning of words by which it has expressed that intention  remembering that it is a remedial measure passed for the protection of the worker  It should not be construed so strictly as to deprive the worker of the protection which Parliament intended that he should have  Harrison v  National Coal Board   AC   at p    per Lord Porter  John Summers   Son Ltd  v  Frost   AC   at p    per Viscount Simonds  McCarthy v  Coldair Ltd      TLR   at pp      per Denning L J  In such a context the strict construction rule is indeed one of last resort  Furthermore  the process of construction must yield for all purposes a definitive statement of the incidence of an obligation imposed on the employer  The legislature cannot speak with a forked tongue  referred toChief Executive Officer of Customs v Labrador Liquor Wholesale Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Were I free to decide the question  I would hold that it is inconsistent with the rule of law for a court to have power to imprison a person for contempt unless the person s conduct amounted to a criminal offence  I realize that preconceived notions or classifications of what is  civil  or  criminal  are not always helpful  But where the liberty of the subject may be in jeopardy as part of the range of sentencing or remedial options open to a court on a finding that a charge of contempt has been proved beyond reasonable doubt  I am firmly of opinion that such a proceeding is a criminal proceeding whether or not a sentence imprisonment ultimately be imposed  cp  Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Labrador Liquor Wholesale Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at           per Hayne J  Gleeson CJ and McHugh J agreeing at       appliedCollector of Customs  NSW  v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd     FLR   The tribunal noted that at the commencement of the hearing Mr Seymour challenged the validity of the decision that had been made by a body which described itself as the Professional Standards   Registration Sub Committee of the Authority  The tribunal referred to its earlier ex tempore decision in which it had ruled that the sub committee had not been given a delegation in writing pursuant to s  A of the Act and that therefore its decision was invalid  The tribunal noted that pursuant to Collector of Customs  NSW  v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd     FLR     ALR   and Z ubair v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   it had jurisdiction to review the impugned decision and in doing so could exercise all the powers and discretions of the Authority  The Tribunal dealt with the first of the Authority s contentions by reciting the facts the subject of the institution of the contempt proceedings before Buddin J and noting the plea of guilt  After recording his Honour s orders  the Tribunal continued         Buddin J in his judgment refers to the circumstances of the offence  It would appear that the Applicant acted for a client in the purchase of a property and that the solicitor for the vendor assumed that the Applicant was a solicitor and the Applicant did not disabuse the vendor s solicitor of that assumption  As Buddin J said in his judgment at paragraph                I have no difficulty in accepting Ms Doolin s evidence that had she known that the offender was not a solicitor  she would have approached her dealings with him quite differently  I accept that she would not have  for example  permitted him to act as her firm s agent on settlement  Nor is it likely that she would have forwarded the signed transfer to him in the circumstances in which she did  or at least not without having first obtained instructions about the matter              The circumstances which led to the orders of Blanch J were not before me and the Applicant was vague when asked to recount the events leading to the proceedings before Blanch J in    I find that a clear inference is that the Applicant did purport to act as a solicitor  hence the nature of the orders made         In the course of his judgment  Buddin J referred to proceedings before Barr J in   where the Law Society of New South Wales had sought orders from the Supreme Court that the Applicant was in contempt of that Court for failing to comply with the orders of Blanch J  There were in those proceedings  three transactions in which the Applicant s conduct was alleged to have constituted breaches of the orders made by Blanch J  That Notice of Motion was dismissed by Barr J and an appeal against his decision was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on   May    see Law Society of New South Wales v Seymour   NSWCA           As Buddin J pointed out  the significance of those proceedings was that only just over   months after those proceedings were brought to finality in his favour  the Applicant embarked upon the activities which gave rise to the proceedings before him   Mr Seymour argued that because the original decision was invalid the tribunal either had no jurisdiction to embark upon a review  or that if I were minded to uphold the appeal to the Court I ought to remit the matter directly to the original decision maker rather than the tribunal pursuant to s   of the AAT Act  He made a formal submission that Collector of Customs  NSW  v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd     ALR     FLR   was wrong but acknowledged that I am bound to follow it  The Authority submitted that the approach of the tribunal applying well known authority was correct   Ordinarily  where the legislature has given a party aggrieved by an administrative decision a full statutory right of appeal on facts and law  that is indicative of a legislative intention that that right is the party s only means of redress against the failure of the original decision maker to follow  according to law  the rules of procedural

at   Aickin J at   and Wilson J at   agreed on this point  Twist v Randwick Municipal Council   HCA         CLR   at     esp at   Zubair v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at          and see too at     where Collector of Customs  NSW  v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd     ALR     FLR   was followed    In Collector of Customs  NSW  v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd     ALR   at     Bowen CJ and Smithers J at    Deane J dissenting at   held that s   of the AAT Act allowed the tribunal to review a  decision  where the person who purported to make the decision had no power to do so  Both Bowen CJ and Smithers J pointed out that a construction of s   of the AAT Act which required the decision the subject of an application before the tribunal for review to be legally valid and effective would create practical problems and inconvenience  And as Hely  Gyles and Allsop JJ held in Minister for Immigration v Ahmed   FCAFC         FCR   at     it is clear that  unless a statute provides otherwise  the tribunal can review a decision which was not authorized by law or by statute   Here  on   February   the Authority wrote to Mr Seymour notifying him that      the Authority has made the decision to refuse your application for registration  At that time  no one was aware that there had been no formal delegation to the actual decision maker to make that  decision   Mr Seymour immediately applied on   February   to the tribunal to review the  decision  and on   April   the tribunal granted a stay of the  decision  which had the effect of permitting Mr Seymour to continue to act as a migration agent   It would produce great uncertainty if the result of the majority decision in Collector of Customs  NSW  v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd     ALR     FLR   which has stood for over   years  were now to be ignored  An example of a consequence of ignoring the settled course of authority in this Court suffices to show the unlikelihood that the Parliament intended such a result  If the original decision were found by the tribunal to have been made by a person without authority to make it or to have been infected by jurisdictional error  and the tribunal then made a decision using its powers under s   of the AAT Act to stand in the stead of the original decision maker  the original decision maker could set the tribunal s decision at nought by making a new decision on the basis that  notwithstanding that the tribunal had a full hearing on the merits  its decision was no decision at all  Rather than providing the subject with an effectual means of redress against the use of the executive power  the AAT Act would be turned into an instrument of uncertainty  Such a result cannot have been intended by the Parliament  Rather  I am of opinion that the intention of the Parliament in enacting the AAT Act was to enable the tribunal to review decisions which were affected by jurisdictional error as well as ones where there was some  even unknown  defect in the decision maker s capacity to make the decision in question referred toCommercial Union Assurance Co op Australia Ltd v Ferrcom Pty Ltd     NSWLR   I can see no error of law  and a good deal of common sense  in the clear inference drawn by the tribunal that Mr Seymour had purported to act as a solicitor before Blanch J made his order  Mr Seymour had knowledge of the facts and he cannot complain that having failed fully and clearly to provide them to the tribunal  it drew inferences against him  cp  Blatch v Archer     Cowp     ER   R v

ordering that a party do or refrain from a particular act or activity  it defines the rights and obligations of the parties as an aspect of the way in which our society is governed  cf  D Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid   HCA         ALJR   at                 per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Heydon JJ   A breach of such an order interferes in the administration of the law because it evinces an intention not to obey the law  as it affects the parties  which has been determined by the Court as a branch of government  That is so whether the injunction is final or interlocutory   Of course  an order for the payment of money as damages or compensation is of a different character  When the Court orders a payment of this kind it creates a debt which is enforceable by a variety of means  Moreover  as is frequent  judgment debtors are not always able to pay debts  Injunctions  however  ought always be framed so that it is possible for the party enjoined to obey their commands   And a failure to obey the injunction does interfere with the administration of the law because it evinces an intention that the command by the Court can be ignored  In effect  since behaviour suggests

cases each court has its own appropriate means of enforcement  and such  contempts  are not criminal  Criminal contempt consists in contumelious behaviour to a court  and is divided into two broad classes  contempt in the face of the court and contempt out of court  All criminal contempts are indictable offences at common law  Contempts in the face of the court have  however  from time

punishment  whether it is imposed in vindication or for remedial or coercive purposes  And there can be no doubt that imprisonment and the imposition of fines  the usual sanctions for contempt  constitute punishment  And the same is true of a sequestration made in consequence of a company s failure to comply with an order or undertaking   While in centuries gone by it may have been legally

tribunal s personal satisfaction and it was free to attribute such weight to factors as it saw fit   CLR at     I am of opinion  having regard to the reasons it gave  that when the tribunal made its evaluation of Mr Seymour at     it did so on a separate and independent basis from the vexed question of whether the contempt was a criminal offence  That is clear because the tribunal at   put the question of the nature of the contempt to one side and referred to the objective facts before Buddin J and the seriousness which his Honour attached to the conduct of Mr Seymour as reflected in the substantial sentence imposed  There is no error of law in what the tribunal did in this regard   It was for the tribunal to form its own state of satisfaction under s   as to the fitness and propriety or integrity of Mr Seymour  In doing so  it took into account matters under s  c  and  h  independently of one another  that is  first  it considered that the contempt was a criminal offence thus enlivening ss  c  and  e  but secondly  and separately  it considered the objective facts revealed by the judgment of Buddin J  thus acting under s  h    In the second of these approaches to forming an opinion under s   the tribunal was entitled to have regard to  and form its own view as to  Mr Seymour s behaviour  as revelatory of the issue under s    It considered how he submitted  as it suited his own apparent self interest  in the Court of Appeal that contempt of the injunction was a criminal offence thus having the benefit of the principle that there is no appeal against an acquittal and in the tribunal  that it was not a criminal offence and so avoiding ss  c  and  e   Of course  each of those stances may have been legally open  But it was for the tribunal to be satisfied that a person who could adopt such flexibility about the very serious matter affecting him in the different contexts of the Court of Appeal and the tribunal  where different and opposite characterizations suited his purpose  was a person of integrity or was fit and proper within the meaning of s     There is no error of law in the evaluative process which the tribunal took  It had regard to both the unmeritorious and the meritorious factors under s    It referred to the fact that Mr Seymour s contemporaries regarded him as a person having real moral worth but it weighed that

  and see too per Toohey  Gaudron and Gummow JJ at     Chew v The Queen   HCA         CLR   at      The modern approach in construing penal statutes was stated by Gibbs J   as he then was  in Beckwith v  The Queen     HCA       CLR   at   as follows           The rule formerly accepted  that statutes creating offences are to be strictly construed  has lost much of its importance in modern times  In determining the meaning of a penal statute the ordinary rules of construction must be applied  but if the language of the statute remains ambiguous or doubtful the ambiguity or doubt may be resolved in favour of the subject by refusing to extend the category of criminal offences  see R  v  Adams     HCA       CLR   at pp      Craies on Statute Law    th ed    pp       The rule is perhaps one of last resort           In the course of argument  the question arose whether the two principles of interpretation to which we have referred  ie a purposive interpretation which furthered industrial safety and the rule that penal provisions should be strictly construed  come into conflict in the present case and if so  how the conflict is to be resolved  If such a conflict was to arise  the court must proceed with its primary task of extracting the intention of the legislature from the fair meaning of words by which it has expressed that intention  remembering that it is a remedial measure passed for the protection of the worker  It should not be construed so strictly as to deprive the worker of the protection which Parliament intended that he should have  Harrison v  National Coal

proceeding for criminal contempt by the summary procedure is the product of historical development  Whatever procedure be employed to prosecute a charge of criminal contempt  in my opinion  cannot change the essential nature of that charge from being a criminal charge  As McHugh JA pointed out in Attorney General  NSW  v John Fairfax   Sons Ltd     NSWLR   at  E  E  the overwhelming preference has been in recent times to use the summary procedure and its utilization need not be justified  unlike attempts in the past to do so  As he said   NSWLR at  E       the summary procedure is a departure from the ordinary course of law for criminal proceedings    But that procedure does not change the character or incidents of criminal contempt from being at common law a criminal offence  Lord Russell of Killowen CJ explained the then state of the law in Reg v Gray     QB   at     saying that the summary jurisdiction was      not a new fangled jurisdiction  it is a jurisdiction as old as the common law itself  of which it forms part    But his Lordship pointed out at that time it was exercised      only when the case is clear and beyond reasonable doubt  and where that feature were not present he said that the courts left it to the Attorney General to decide whether to proceed by criminal information  i e  indictment  see R v Hull     NSWLR    The reporter noted in Reg v Gray

a decision is found to have been affected by jurisdictional error  even though it is  regarded in law  as no decision at all    Plaintiff S  v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at       is to provide an authoritative and legally binding judicial determination which recognizes that the decision has no legal effect  Of course  it could be said that any such relief or writ is unnecessary because the presence of the jurisdictional error entails the result that there is nothing to quash or upon which to prohibit further proceedings  But the availability of these remedies enables the Court to perform its function of quelling controversies and authoritatively determining that the decision cannot be given effect thereafter   Now when a person such as Mr Seymour  is confronted with a decision which affects him or her or it  two possible avenues of legal challenge are available  one involving the executive power of the Commonwealth through a review in the tribunal under the AAT Act

     CLR   at           McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ said        The primary object of statutory construction is to construe the relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute  see Taylor v Public Service Board  NSW    HCA         CLR   at   per Barwick CJ   The meaning of the provision must be determined  by reference to the

context  the general purpose and policy of a provision and its consistency and fairness are surer guides to its meaning than the logic with which it is constructed   Thus  the process of construction must always begin by examining the context of the provision that is being construed   Toronto Suburban Railway Co v Toronto Corporation   AC   at   Minister for Lands  NSW  v Jeremias   HCA

subordinate provision  and which must give way to the other    Institute of Patent Agents v Lockwood   AC   at   per Lord Herschell LC   Only by determining the hierarchy of the provisions will it be possible in many cases to give each provision the meaning which best gives effect to its purpose and language while maintaining the unity of the statutory scheme                Furthermore  a court construing a statutory provision must strive to give meaning to every word of the provision   The Commonwealth v Baume   HCA         CLR   at   per Griffith CJ  at   per O Connor J  Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigraiton Local Government   Ethnic Affairs   HCA         CLR   at     per Mason CJ   In The Commonwealth v Baume     HCA       CLR   at   Griffith CJ cited R v Berchet     Show KB     ER   to support the proposition that it was  a known rule in the interpretation of Statutes that such a sense is to be made upon the whole as that no clause  sentence  or word shall prove superfluous  void  or insignificant  if by any other construction they may all be made useful and pertinent    Their Honours held   CLR at     that the duty of the court is to give the words of a statutory provision the meaning which the legislature is taken to have intended them to have   In ascertaining what meaning the differing expressions in ss  c  and  e  were taken by the Parliament to have  it is important to bear in mind that each section is concerned with the impact which a conviction may have upon the Authority s performance of its functions in relation to the registration of a migration agent  First  s  c  appears in the principal provision dealing with the function of registration  which is an annual event for every migration agent  Secondly  s  e  is relevant to the ongoing function of the Authority under s   pursuant to which it has a discretion to cancel or suspend the registration of a migration agent or to caution him or her  The occasion for the exercise of that discretion arises if the Authority is satisfied  inter alia  that                   f  the agent is not a person of integrity or is otherwise not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance  The evident purpose of s   is to cast an obligation on the migration agent to notify the Authority of the events there enumerated so that the Authority can consider whether to revisit  pursuant to s   and the scheme of natural justice in Part   of Division   of the Act  the question of registration  Thus under s  a  the migration agent s bankruptcy must be notified and s  e  makes bankruptcy a matter which enlivens the Authority s powers to cancel or suspend the migration agent s registration or to caution him or her  And  s  g  requires the Authority to take into account an applicant s

Blackburn J referredRe Colina  Ex parte Torney   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Mr Seymour also argued that contempt being within the inherent jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of New South Wales as a superior court of record  a conviction for it was not a conviction   of an offence under a law of     a State   within the meaning of s  e  of the Act  This was because in Re Colina  Ex parte Torney   HCA         CLR   a number of justices had held that the offence of contempt by scandalizing the court  which had been originally been triable on indictment  was not an       offence against any law of the Commonwealth   so as to require trial by jury pursuant to s   of the Constitution   This was because the source of the Family Court s power to deal with contempts was derived from Ch III of the Constitution   which was not  within the meaning of s   of the Constitution     a law of the Commonwealth    So  it was said  the source of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to punish for contempt  being inherent in its establishment as a superior court of record  the same reasoning applied to deny proceedings for contempt the character of resulting in a conviction of an offence under a law of the State of New South Wales   Mr Seymour also submitted that because a conviction for contempt could not become spent under Pt VIIC of the Crimes Act    Cth  within the meaning of s  c  of the Act  that section manifested an intention to exclude from its purview convictions for contempt   The Authority submitted that the reasoning in Re Colina  Ex parte Torney   HCA         CLR   did not affect the construction of s  e  despite the fact that this might mean that similar wording in that section would create different results were the contempt alleged one that had been determined in a court established under Ch III of the Constitution   This result was supported because it was said that a law of a State could include that State s common law and its statute law  including ss   and   of the Supreme Court Act    NSW  and the fact that in Attorney General v Whitley     NSWLR   at  A D  to which Buddin J had referred  it appeared that the finding of guilt in effect of the charge of contempt was a conviction of the criminal offence   In Re Colina  Ex parte Torney   HCA         CLR   the Court considered whether the power of the Family Court to punish for contempt was derived from a law of the Commonwealth  By s   of the Family Law Act    Cth  the Family Court was declared to have the same power to punish for contempt as had the High Court  And s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth  provided that the High Court had the same power and authority to punish contempts as had the Supreme Court of Judicature in England at the commencement of the Judiciary Act    Cth    Accordingly  the Court was evenly divided on the question as to whether contempt of a Ch III court was an offence against a law of the Commonwealth  However  Re Colina  Ex parte Torney   HCA         CLR   is not decisive of the question of construction of ss  c  and  e  of the Act in relation to a contempt of the Supreme Court of New South Wales  Rather  that case involved for Gleeson CJ  Gummow and Hayne JJ the application of the principle that the common law is not a law of the Commonwealth   Nowadays  all charges of contempt are invariably heard by a judge

which is appropriate to apply to a case like the present when he said     But if the right of appeal is exercised and the appellate authority acts fairly and does not depart from natural justice the appeal may then be said to have  cured  a defect in natural justice or fairness which occurred at first instance  Certainly this view has been taken in a number of cases  notably by the Privy Council in De Verteuil v  Knaggs   AC   Pillai v  Singapore City Council     WLR   at p   and by the Supreme Court of Canada in Re Clark and Ontario Securities Commission     DLR  d    and King v  University of Saskatchewan     DLR  d    cf  Denton v  Auckland City   NZLR   and Leary v  National Union of Vehicle Builders   Ch   where the contrary view was taken  In this conflict of authority my preference is for the approach taken by the Privy Council and the Supreme Court of Canada  first  because the party affected has elected to treat the administrative decision as a valid  though erroneous decision  by appealing from it  in preference to asserting his right to a proper performance by the authority of its duty at first instance  and secondly  because in some cases the court will be compelled to take account of the public interest in the efficiency of the administrative process and the necessity for reasonably prompt despatch of public business and balance that interest against the countervailing interest of the individual in securing a fair hearing  in appropriate cases that balance will be achieved if the individual secures a fair hearing on his appeal  referred toUnited

and Gummow JJ at     Chew v The Queen   HCA         CLR   at      The modern approach in construing penal statutes was stated by Gibbs J   as he then was  in Beckwith v  The Queen     HCA       CLR   at   as follows           The rule formerly accepted  that statutes creating offences are to be strictly construed  has lost much of its importance in modern times  In determining the meaning of a penal statute the ordinary rules of construction must be applied  but if the language of the statute remains ambiguous or doubtful the ambiguity or doubt may be resolved in favour of the subject by refusing to extend the category of criminal offences  see R  v  Adams     HCA       CLR   at pp      Craies on Statute Law    th ed    pp       The rule is perhaps one of last resort           In the course of argument  the question arose whether the two principles of interpretation to which we have referred  ie a purposive interpretation which furthered industrial safety and the rule that penal provisions should be strictly construed  come into conflict in the present case and if so  how the conflict is to be resolved  If such a conflict was to arise  the court must proceed with its primary task of extracting the intention of the legislature from the fair meaning of words by which it has expressed that intention  remembering that it is a remedial measure passed for the protection of the worker  It should not be construed so strictly as to deprive the worker of the protection which Parliament intended that he should have  Harrison v  National Coal Board   AC   at p    per Lord Porter  John Summers   Son Ltd  v  Frost   AC   at p    per Viscount Simonds  McCarthy v  Coldair Ltd      TLR   at pp      per Denning L J  In such a context the strict construction rule is indeed one of last resort  Furthermore  the process of construction must yield for all purposes a definitive statement of the incidence of an obligation imposed on the employer  The legislature cannot speak with a forked tongue  referred toWeaver v Law Society of New South Wales   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  On behalf Mr Seymour it was submitted that the procedure used before Buddin J followed the scheme in SCR Pt   r     and that the proceedings were in the civil jurisdiction in the Supreme Court  It was said that contempt proceedings are sui generis   particularly where the proceedings were themselves taken within the original   proceedings in which the undertaking had been given by Mr Seymour  Those proceedings arose out of the earlier   disciplinary proceedings in which Mr Seymour had been found guilty of professional misconduct and struck off  Accordingly  it was argued that having regard to the fact that disciplinary proceedings both under the relevant legislation and in the exercise of the Supreme Court s inherent jurisdiction were not criminal proceedings but sui generis because the Court was called upon to examine the conduct of solicitors as explained by Mason J in Weaver v Law Society of New South Wales   HCA         CLR   at   that the contempt proceedings brought before Buddin J were of the same character   Although Mr Seymour argued that the Supreme Court s disciplinary jurisdiction over solicitors was sui generis   as Mason J had said in Weaver v Law Society of New South Wales   HCA         CLR   at   I do not consider that to be relevant here  The charge of contempt related to disobedience of an order of that Court  The judicial source of the order  even if  sui generis   is not of any significance to the charge  The charge related to the conduct of Mr Seymour in contravening an order of the Court which was valid and binding on him  And while it may be that the offence of contempt of court attracts remedies which are also sui generis   the uniqueness of the remedies is not decisive of the question whether contempt is properly to be characterized as a criminal offence referred toWeissensteiner v The Queen   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I can see no error of law  and a good deal of common sense  in the clear inference drawn by the tribunal that Mr Seymour

v The Commonwealth  the Native Title Act case    HCA         CLR   at   Mason CJ  Brennan  Deane  Toohey  Gaudron and McHugh JJ said     A  law of the Commonwealth  as that term is used in the Constitution   cannot be the unwritten law  It is necessarily statute law  for the only power to make Commonwealth law is vested in the Parliament  Consitiution  s     see also Covering Clause   and ss   and          But the common law is not itself a law of the Commonwealth   I am of opinion that the common law is a law of each State  The reasoning underlying the decision in the Native Title Case   HCA         CLR   at   was that the Constitution was the only source of the laws of the Commonwealth and it identified the Parliament as the mechanism by which such laws came into existence  But the nature of the federation created by the Constitution recognized that a body of law  separate from statute  existed in the former colonies which became States on   January    That body of law  the common law  undoubtedly exists today  It forms part of the  single system of jurisprudence constituted by the Constitution   federal  State and Territory laws and the common law of Australia  identified by Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow and Hayne JJ in John Pfeiffer Pty Ltd v Rogerson   HCA         CLR   at      see too Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation   HCA         CLR

not paid debts  imprisonment in Australia today can only occur where a person is sentenced to a term by a court pursuant to law  be it a statute or the unwritten law  or is remanded  or held for a very limited time before he or she must be brought before a court or a justice of the peace  cf  Williams v The Queen   HCA         CLR   in custody as incident of the administration of the criminal

remarked in Jennison v Baker     QB   at  G  of the distinction between  civil  and  criminal  contempt     I think that  at any rate today  this is an unhelpful and almost meaningless classification      see too per John Laws  then junior counsel to the Treasury  in  Current Problems in the Law of Contempt     Current Legal Prolems   at     quoted in Aldridge Eady   Smith on Contempt   rd ed  at     followeddiscussedWitham v Holloway   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Tribunal then proceeded to consider whether the proceedings before Buddin J could be described as having resulted in a conviction for a criminal offence  It referred to a number of authorities to which I will have to refer in due course  including Attorney General  NSW  v Whiley     NSWLR   Whitham v Holloway   HCA         CLR   and Australasian Meat Industry Employees  Union v Mudginberri Pty Limited   HCA         CLR    The Tribunal concluded that there was no doubt that proceedings before Buddin J had been brought with the purpose of punishing Mr Seymour noting that it had been common ground  as Buddin J recorded in his reasons  that the provisions of the Crimes  Sentencing Procedure  Act    NSW  applied and that the penalty imposed had been one of imprisonment for a fixed term  as opposed to an indefinite term until the contempt of being purged  The tribunal then said       Therefore whilst not free from doubt  I accept for current purposes that the contempt proceedings before Buddin J were criminal         The result of that finding has application to both subparagraphs     and     of the Respondent s Statement of Facts and Contentions   Mr Seymour relied upon the statement that all proceedings for contempt   must realistically be seen as criminal in nature   as Deane J pointed out in Hinch v Attorney General  Vict    HCA         CLR   at   and as approved by Brennan  Deane  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Witham v Holloway   HCA         CLR   at    It was said that  accordingly  the tribunal s finding that the contempt charge determined by Buddin J was criminal was an error of law  Next he argued that that error of law affected the tribunal s finding that Mr Seymour demonstrated a lack of candour and openness by his apparently contradictory stances taken before the Court of Appeal in the earlier contempt proceedings  namely that the Law Society should not be allowed to appeal against his acquittal  and his stance in the proceedings before the tribunal  that the proceedings before Buddin J were not criminal    The Authority submitted that the tribunal was correct to classify the proceedings before Buddin J as having involved a conviction of a criminal offence by reference to the character of the jurisdiction invoked under Pt   rr   and   of the Supreme Court Rules   the fact that the proceedings were to seek the punishment by imprisonment of Mr Seymour and the nature of the inherent jurisdiction to punish for contempt  The Authority submitted that the character of the contempt charged before Buddin J was that of disobedience  in the sense of a defiance of the authority of the Supreme Court and that there was a public injury occasioned by such defiance  It was said that  the purpose of the proceedings was to maintain the integrity of the judicial process  to advance the public interest to vindicate judicial authority or to maintain the integrity of the judicial process  relying on that class of contempt as being within a class of criminal contempt as explained in Witham v Holloway     CLR at     In Witham v Holloway   HCA         CLR   all justices considered the historical classification of contempts as  civil  and  criminal  to be unsatisfactory  Brennan  Deane  Toohey and Gaudron JJ described the differences upon which the distinction of classification is based as being in many respects  illusory    CLR at   while McHugh J said the case for abolishing the distinction  is a strong one    CLR at     The reliance on the distinction in a case like the present  where the applicant was sentenced to nine months imprisonment  suspended  for breaching a court order shows how unworkable the distinction really is in practice  Was the contempt with which the applicant was charged civil when the charge was preferred  Did it remain so or did it transmute  as the seriousness of  and contumaciousness of  his conduct was proved in evidence or found by Buddin J when giving judgment  The very notion that an allegation of contempt can have such a chameleon like character demonstrated  in Australasian Meat Industry Employees  Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     and in Witham v Holloway   HCA         CLR   that all such cases had to be decided on the criminal standard of proof  The High Court did not have to decide in the latter case whether the distinction between  civil  and  criminal  contempt should be abolished  see   CLR at     In Witham v Holloway   HCA         CLR   at   Brennan  Deane  Toohey and Gaudron JJ said that because of the illusory nature of the differences said to exist between the  civil  and  criminal  classes of contempt and the fact that the usual outcome of all such proceedings is punishment  all proceedings for contempt must realistically be seen as criminal in nature   That does not result in all contempt proceedings themselves being now seen to be for a criminal offence  Indeed  their Honours went on to say   CLR at      However  to say that proceedings for contempt are essentially criminal in nature is not to equate them with the trial of a criminal charge  There are clear procedural differences  the most obvious being that criminal charges ordinarily involve trial by jury  whereas charges of contempt do not  There is no basis  in our view  for importing into the law of contempt the nineteenth century rules which allowed a verdict of guilty  given in a jury trial  to be quashed on appeal  but did not permit of an order for retrial  Moreover  the issue  so far as contempt is concerned  is not whether there should be a retrial  but whether there should be a rehearing   The elusiveness of the distinction Windeyer J identified is demonstrated by the result in Witham v Holloway   HCA         CLR    There the question was what standard of proof applied  i e  civil or criminal  in proceedings which fell squarely within Lord Atkinson s  civil  classification  namely  charges of contempt that the appellant knowingly or recklessly presented a false or misleading statement of his assets and liabilities in an affidavit which he had been ordered to make and that he breached  what was then termed  a Mareva injunction   this is now known as a Mareva order  Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at           by dealing with his assets contrary to the terms  Brennan  Deane  Toohey and Gaudron JJ said   CLR at        Given that purpose or object cannot readily be disentangled from effect and given  also  that a penal or disciplinary jurisdiction may be called into play in proceedings alleging breach of an order or undertaking  it is necessary to acknowledge  as it was in Mudginberri     HCA       CLR   at   that punitive and remedial objects are  in the words of Salmon LJ  inextricably intermixed    Jennison v Baker     QB   at        Moreover and  perhaps  of more importance  nothing is achieved by describing some proceedings as   punitive   and others as   remedial or coercive    Punishment is punishment  whether it is imposed in vindication or for remedial or coercive purposes  And there can be no doubt that imprisonment and the imposition of fines  the usual sanctions for contempt  constitute punishment  And the same is true of a sequestration made in consequence of a company s failure to comply with an order or undertaking   When the High Court held in Witham v Holloway   HCA         CLR   at   that all contempts are criminal in nature and must be proved on the criminal standard  it ensured that the alleged contemnor was afforded the safeguards given at common law to all accuseds  The Court also recognized that the historical classification of  civil  and  criminal  contempt is unsatisfactory   Accordingly  I must decide whether Mr Seymour was found by Buddin J to have acted contumaciously in breach of the injunction  A  civil  contempt can become  criminal  where the act charged is contumacious in the sense that in doing it there was a direct intention to disobey the order   Witham v Holloway   HCA         CLR   at   per McHugh J citing Warrington J s well known dictum in Stancomb v Trowbridge Urban Council     Ch   at    A breach of an injunction or undertaking to the Court can also be criminal if it is      an obstinate disregard  of the obligation imposed by or owed to the Court   Australasian Meat Industry Employees  Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at      The hallmark of a classification of  criminal  contempt of this nature is contumacy or defiance   Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Morgan   HCA         CLR   at   per Barwick CJ      per Windeyer J

at  A D Handley JA held that Pt   r   of the Supreme Court Rules    NSW  which contained a power to discharge a convicted contemnor from prison  was authorized by an Act  namely the Supreme Court Act    NSW   They held that this was because  first  the rule had been made as delegated legislation under the Act and  secondly  in The Queen v Kirby  Ex parte Boilermakers  Society of Australia   HCA         CLR   at   Dixon CJ  McTiernan  Fullagar and Kitto JJ had approved of the explanation given by Dixon J in Victorian Stevedoring and General Contracting Co Pty Ltd and Meakes v Dignan   HCA         CLR   at     that a statute may authorize the Executive to make a law i e  to make delegated legislation and that such a law is made under the statute   I am also of opinion that s  e  required Mr Seymour to notify the Authority of his conviction of the offence of contempt which is an offence under the law of New South Wales  For the reasons above  I am of that opinion whether the contempt power was inherent in the Supreme Court of New South Wales  and so was part of that State s unwritten law  or was created under the Supreme Court Act    NSW  or SCR Part   rr      see Young v Registrar Court of Appeal  No       NSWLR   at  D  G   A D    Accordingly  the tribunal committed no error of law in finding that Mr Seymour had been convicted of a criminal offence by Buddin J and that he had not declared that he was the subject of a criminal proceeding in his   May   application to the Authority when he ought to have declared that he was  It was also correct to have decided that Mr Seymour failed to notify the Authority in accordance with s  e  after his conviction by Buddin J   It was open to the tribunal in coming to a view as to whether or not Mr Seymour was a person of integrity or was a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance to consider his conduct in making the original application in   for registration as a migration agent  The tribunal found  correctly  that there was no question at that time that the PCA high range offence conviction had not been spent by reason of the Criminal Records Act    NSW  ss   and    see   referred toZ ubair v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The tribunal noted that at the commencement of the hearing Mr Seymour challenged the validity of the decision that had been made by a body which described itself as the Professional Standards   Registration Sub Committee of the Authority  The tribunal referred to its earlier ex tempore decision in which it had ruled that the sub committee had not been given a delegation in writing pursuant to s  A of the Act and that therefore its decision was invalid  The tribunal noted that pursuant to Collector of Customs  NSW  v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd     FLR     ALR   and Z ubair v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   it had jurisdiction to review the impugned decision and in doing so could exercise all the powers and discretions of the Authority  The Tribunal dealt with the first of the Authority s contentions by reciting the facts the subject of the institution of the contempt proceedings before Buddin J and noting the plea of guilt  After recording his Honour s orders  the Tribunal continued         Buddin J in his judgment refers to the circumstances of the offence  It would appear that the Applicant acted for a client in the purchase of a property and that the solicitor for the vendor assumed that the Applicant was a solicitor and the Applicant did not disabuse the vendor s solicitor of that assumption  As Buddin J said in his judgment at paragraph                I have no difficulty in accepting Ms Doolin s evidence that had she known that the offender was not a solicitor  she would have approached her dealings with him quite differently  I accept that she would not have  for example  permitted him to act as her firm s agent on settlement  Nor is it likely that she would have forwarded the signed transfer to him in the circumstances in which she did  or at least not without having first obtained instructions about the matter              The circumstances which led to the orders of Blanch J were not before me and the Applicant was vague when asked to recount the events leading to the proceedings before Blanch J in    I find that a clear inference is that the Applicant did purport to act as a solicitor  hence the nature of the orders made         In the course of his judgment  Buddin J referred to proceedings before Barr J in   where the Law Society of New South Wales had sought orders from the Supreme Court that the Applicant was in contempt of that Court for failing to comply with the orders of Blanch J  There were in those proceedings  three transactions in which the Applicant s conduct was alleged to have constituted breaches of the orders made by Blanch J  That Notice of Motion was dismissed by Barr J and an appeal against his decision was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on   May    see Law Society of New South Wales v Seymour   NSWCA           As Buddin J pointed out  the significance of those proceedings was that only just over   months after those proceedings were brought to finality in his favour  the Applicant embarked upon the activities which gave rise to the proceedings before him   Ordinarily  where the legislature has given a party aggrieved by an administrative decision a full statutory right of appeal on facts and
