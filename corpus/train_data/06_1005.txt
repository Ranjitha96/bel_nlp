Commissioner of Taxation v Milne  with Corrigendumdated   August     FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedNSW Associated Blue Metal Quarries Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  As to whether facts as found fall within the ordinary meaning of the words used in a statute  the same normally involves an issue of law  Thus for instance in NSW Associated Blue Metal Quarries Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at   Kitto J observed as follows     The next question must be whether the material before the Court reasonably admits of different conclusions as to whether the appellant s operations fall within the ordinary meaning of the words as so determined  and that is a question of law    If different conclusions are reasonably possible  it is necessary to decide which is the correct conclusion  and that is a question of fact       On   December   Mr Milne made application for release of his income taxation liability for the fiscal years ended   June   to   June    inclusive   He was examined by the Tribunal and a report of that examination was forwarded to the Taxation Relief Board  the Board  on   October    Subsequently on   October   the Board granted Mr Milne partial relief from his then income taxation indebtedness to the Commissioner  There was no evidence that such taxation indebtedness was incurred in consequence of Mr Milne s engagement in taxation avoidance or in any taxation scheme of any kind  The total amount of income tax indebtedness the subject of the Board s consideration was     and the extent of the relief so granted was      The Board s reasons for decision were as follows     The Board considered that the applicant could make a genuine attempt to repay a part of the debt by instalments without being deprived of the necessities mentioned above  food  clothing  medical supplies  accommodation  education for children and other basic requirements       In reaching this decision  the Board noted that two separate statements contained in the AAT report pointed to the capacity of the applicant to pay up to   toward the debt   Subsequently on   October   Mr Milne made a further application for release from his income tax liability  by that time amounting to     relating to the fiscal years   June   to   June    inclusive   The context to that further application included the prior service of a bankruptcy notice in February   and of a creditor s petition on   June   in each case at the instance of the Commissioner  The application for release was rejected by the Commissioner on   February   and Mr Milne applied to the Tribunal  on   February   for review of that second decision  pursuant to Part IVC of the Administration Act headed Taxation objections  reviews and appeals  By the time of the hearing by the Tribunal of that review application on   May   according to the Commissioner s evidence  the tax debt had increased to     whereof the amount eligible for release amounted to      Moreover the Commissioner indicated to the Tribunal that a further   would become due for payment on   May   and that there might well be future unspecified taxation debts referred toRe Filsell and Commissioner of Taxation   AATA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth AATA  html  The Tribunal next referred to the   two stage process   identified and discussed by Member Trowse in Re Filsell and Commissioner of Taxation   AATA   in the following context of his consideration of the implications of s     of the Administration Act     In the Tribunal s opinion  the language of the legislation requires a two stage approach  First  the decision maker must decide whether the settlement of the liability will result in serious hardship  If that decision is favourable to the applicant  the discretion offered by sub section     then falls for consideration  In reaching the decision to release in whole or part  the question to be addressed is whether  in all the circumstances  it is just and proper to provide the requested relief  Matters pertaining to the incidence and consequence of the tax and the effect of its exaction upon the affairs of the person will bear upon the issue of whether the relief is just and proper  Support for the two stage approach is to be found in the decision of the High Court in Rex v Trebilco  ex parte F S  Falkiner   Sons Ltd   HCA         CLR       I have of course extracted s     of the Administration Act earlier in these reasons  I would respectfully seek to apply that principled approach   As to the notion of serious hardship above addressed in Filsell   the Tribunal below drew attention to Re Wilson and Minister for Territories     ALD   where Deputy President Hall discussed  at   the meaning of the similar notion of undue hardship  in the context of exercise of the statutory discretion of the Minister to discharge a liability for payment of rates on the ground of undue hardship  being a meaning said by Deputy President Hall to connote something more severe than substantial hardship   The Tribunal below also discussed Deputy President Hall s view that undue hardship means  hardship that is excessive in the circumstances  and that  foreseeability and control  constitute  relevant considerations  to the determination of hardship   Understandably Deputy President Hall further observed that neither expression undue hardship nor substantial hardship is susceptible to  precise quantification    The rationalisation of authorities undertaken in Re Wilson has provided assistance to later administrative decisions concerning this and analogous legislative provisions   In reaching that conclusion  I have been unable to accept that the Tribunal was bound to adopt and implement the approach to administrative review advocated by the Commissioner  inclusively by way of appraisal of any comparison of the value of Mr Milne s assets with the amount of his liabilities at any relevant point of time  having regard to the reality of the extent of the financial hardship which would be likely to attend an exaction of the amount required to satisfy Mr Milne s outstanding taxation indebtedness  inclusive of accrued statutory interest changes  which  if not leaving Mr Milne  destitute without any means of support    would have constituted nevertheless serious hardship   in accordance with the text of the Commissioner s policy guidelines framed by TR   and in the light of the approach undertaken specifically and by way of practical exemplification in Re Filsell and Re Wilson  referred toRe Wilson and Minister for Territories     ALD   As to the notion of

administrative decisions concerning this and analogous legislative provisions   As to the factor of fairness to other taxpayers identified in Re Wilson   being a factor which I would acknowledge to be relevant to the Tribunal s approach in principle to decision making  the Tribunal recorded also that Mr Milne had earned a high level of income in the past  and was  still earning income in a higher bracket   Moreover the Tribunal found that Mr Milne had been      able to acquire assets and to live reasonably well throughout his adverse business fortunes    though the notions of high and higher are of course relative concepts  and need to be applied with care having regard to all conceivably relevant circumstances  In any event the Tribunal accepted in favour of the Commissioner the proposition that      releasing Mr Milne would not be fair in the absence of special factors    consistently with the previous Tribunal decisions of Ferguson and Commissioner of Taxation   AATA   and Spicer and Commissioner of Taxation   AATA     the Tribunal exemplifying Ferguson as a case involving insufficient hardship for the availability of taxation relief  In the present case moreover  the

dependant son until he finishes his schooling and obtains his HSC     In reaching that conclusion  I have been unable to accept that the Tribunal was bound to adopt and implement the approach to

to the statutory notion of serious hardship addressed in decisions referrable to the not dissimilarly framed provisions of the precursor s   of the Income Tax Assessment Act    Cth  reliance was placed by the Tribunal upon this Court s decisions in Powell v Evreniades     FCR   where Hill J made the following observations at     in the context of the then Tax Relief Board s statutory discretion to release the trustee of a deceased person s estate wholly or in part from a taxation liability in the case of  serious hardship           The Court will not subject  a statement pursuant to s   of the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act    Cth    to a fine analysis with a view to finding through a microscopic study of it some error of law         There is no definition in s   of what is meant by  serious hardship  nor would one expect there to be  Each of the words in the phrase is an ordinary English word having a well understood meaning    The context in which the words appear makes it clear that the Relief Board is to consider whether the exaction of the full amount of tax would involve the dependants of a deceased taxpayer in financial difficulty which in all the circumstances can be said to be serious    it is obvious enough that what will constitute either will depend upon the circumstances of a given case      It is inappropriate to endeavour in the abstract to state tests of what will and what will not constitute serious hardship within the context of s    Clearly there would be severe financial hardship if the dependants of a deceased person were left destitute without any means of support  That is not to say that in any particular case something less than that will not constitute serious hardship          it was open to the Board to conclude that the exaction of the full amount of   tax would cause serious hardship  just as it was also open to the Board to conclude that exaction of the whole tax would not leave this applicant and her daughter in a situation that could properly be described as one of serious hardship  The circumstances of the present case  while clearly very close to the end of the spectrum representing destitution still come within that range of spectrum in which the decision could not be described as unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense    that is to say unless consideration of some extraneous or irrelevant factor intervened to vitiate the decision             I can see no error of law in the way to which the Board so proceeded    Understandably counsel for Mr Milne invoked  as largely here applicable  those observations of his Honour  As I have already implied  that precursor s   was expressed to require regard to be paid to the serious hardship which might otherwise affect a taxpayer in the event of an absence of intervention by way of release  or partial release  of income tax liability  That precursor provision operated directly in favour of the dependants of a deceased taxpayer as well as a taxpayer  but for present purposes  the dictum of his Honour in Powell nevertheless provides a significant measure of assistance in relation to the operation of the present s         Further in his reasons for judgment in Powell at   Hill J referred to the dictum of Windeyer J in Giris Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at   concerning the need      to be guided and controlled by the policy and purpose of the enactment  so far as that is manifest in it  and to  exclude from    consideration any matter which it would be unlawful    to take as a criterion     subject to the qualification where  the statute seems to allow great latitude to the Commissioner in forming his opinion    Moreover his Honour referred to what was said by Dixon J  as he then was  in R v Trebilco  Ex parte FS Falkiner   Sons Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   as to certain statutory  considerations by which an exercise of discretion is to be guided     t  he nature of those considerations  to  be gathered from the scope and object of the provision    Additionally his Honour referred further to dictum of Mason J  as he then was  in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   where his Honour described the statutory discretion there addressed  albeit not related to fiscal exaction  as      similarly unconfined  except in so far as there may be found in the subject matter  scope and purpose of the statute some implied limitation on the factors to which the decision maker may legitimately have regard  and where his Honour thereafter proceeded to emphasise that  b y analogy  where the ground of review is that a relevant consideration has not been taken into account and the discretion is unconfined by the terms of the statute  the court will not find that the decision maker is bound to take a particular matter into account unless an implication that he is bound to do so is to be found in the subject matter  scope and purpose of the Act   Those factors have aspects of materiality in relation to the issue or issues here falling for consideration   Subsequently in Van Grieken v Veilands     ATR   Gummow J cited the principled approach outlined by Hill J in Powell with at least implicit approval  observing that his Honour had further pointed out  at   of Powell   that the decision maker was entitled to  consider not only such matters as go to the issue of serious hardship  but also other matters which  in the discretion of the Board  may be relevant    In my opinion submissions propounded by the Commissioner  which I have sought to outline in detail discretely or in the aggregate  do not vitiate the conclusions of the Tribunal according to law  The Tribunal s conclusions were reasonably open for adoption  being sufficiently founded upon evidentiary material bearing upon the critical statutory issue of serious hardship   including in particular the fraudulent conduct of Mr Milne s former partner in legal practice and its adverse effect upon Mr Milne financially and probably to at least an intangible extent professionally  and the unsaleable character of the Brindabella property for the time being for the reasons I have earlier indicated  It is of course necessary in that regard that the Commissioner s challenge to the factual findings of the Tribunal should establish a viable footing according to principles of administrative law  and the present appeal does not of course operate by way of a re hearing  As I have foreshadowed  I am unable to accept that the Commissioner has distilled administrative error in the juridical sense referrable to the reasoning and findings of the Tribunal  being reasoning and findings which were rationally open for adoption in my opinion according to principles of administrative law  and in particular in the light of the relevant evidentiary material placed before the Tribunal  That material was consistent essentially with the conclusion that any enforced exaction of the outstanding income tax indebtedness of Mr Milne would cause serious hardship within the scope of that notion established for instance in Powell and subsequently in Van Grieken   and as continues in operation in the terms of operation of s     of the Administration Act citedGiris Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR  http www

in the subject matter  scope and purpose of the Act   Those factors have aspects of materiality in relation to the issue or issues here falling for consideration   The Tribunal s finding as to likely  serious hardship  was broadly contended by the Commissioner to be based on an hypothesis that caused the Tribunal to ignore matters that were relevant to the task required of it by s     of the Administration Act  those matters being the operation of the Bankruptcy Act   and also of the LP Act  The context  scope and object of s     of the Administration Act was said by the Commissioner to have required the Tribunal to consider the matters that would  or could  affect the financial circumstances of Mr Milne in the light of his then current tax liability  Accordingly  so the Commissioner s submissions continued  for the Tribunal to fail to take into consideration matters  such as the operation relevantly of those statutory provisions  constituted a further error of law  either by way of statutory misconstruction  or failure to take into account relevant considerations due to statutory misconstruction or otherwise  In that latter regard  I was referred to Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Limited   HCA         CLR   in particular in relation to what appears in the reasons for judgment of Mason J  as he then was  at   under the heading Failure To Take Into Account a Relevant Consideration   Of course in circumstances where the Tribunal  at least inherently or implicitly in the particular context the subject necessarily of consideration by the decision maker  took into account relevant considerations and correspondingly took no account of irrelevant considerations  so much would normally suffice to satisfy the requirements of administrative obligations   The power under s     was contended by the Commissioner in any event to require two matters in particular to be considered and determined  first  whether there would be serious hardship to Mr Milne in the circumstances postulated   and secondly  whether in all the circumstances otherwise prevailing  the Commissioner ought to have exercised the statutory discretion to release Mr Milne s subject taxation liability  In considering the first of those issues  it was contended by the Commissioner that the Tribunal addressed what it considered to be the so called test of foreseeability and control  presumably thereby referring to the circumstances in which Mr Milne came to have incurred the subject tax liabilities in the first place  The second consideration was described in terms as to whether the release of Mr Milne  if granted  would be fair to  others  whatever the implications of that broad description  The Tribunal was said by the Commissioner to have considered that in circumstances where a person had earnt a high level of income in the past  and was continuing to earn a high income  special factors were necessary in order to establish  serious hardship   The description  high income  is in any event somewhat unspecific to be necessarily helpful  The Tribunal found that Mr Milne s  battle to continue his professional work    despite ill health  and his need to support his dependent son until he finished school  were  special factors     The approaches of the Tribunal s reasoning leading to its decision making were attacked by the Commissioner as wrong  in that it was said to have  misunderstood the meaning of serious hardship as a so called backward looking matter  rather than a matter that turned on an objective analysis of the future   On a proper understanding of that statutory term  questions as to special factors were said not to arise  In particular  the Commissioner asserted that a taxpayer s  struggle to continue working  was simply irrelevant  but for what it may ultimately matter  I do not think that somewhat simplistic description sufficiently reflects the complexity of circumstances that the Tribunal explicitly and implicitly took into account in relation to Mr Milne   Addressing a further basis advanced by the Commissioner for the present administrative review sought  it was contended that on a proper understanding of the two tiered test in subs     of the Administration Act  no reasonable Tribunal could have exercised the statutory discretion to release Mr Milne from his taxation liability  Reference was made by the Commissioner in that regard to the grant of administrative relief made available in Parramatta City Council v Pestell   HCA         CLR   which related to a local Council s imposition of a rate because of the special benefit flowing from the Council s execution of a particular work or service on public property  and which the High Court affirmed to be invalid  It was argued by the Commissioner conversely that the factual circumstances of a high income earner having substantial assets  sufficient in value to meet all current liabilities  could not reasonably fall within the statutory notion of serious hardship   It is normally a formidable task to establish that the decision of an administrative decision maker satisfies that test of invalidity  The Commissioner advanced the further case that the exercise of the Tribunal s power to release Mr Milne was unreasonable  in that on the evidence placed before it  no reasonable person could have come to the conclusions reached by the Tribunal in its decision the subject of appeal  I was referred again to Peko Wallsend where at   Mason J discussed the scope of the principle of Wednesbury unreasonableness  I would make a similar observation upon that submission to that which I have made in relation to satisfaction of the test in Pestell  citedVan Grieken v Veilands     ATR   Subsequently in Van Grieken v Veilands     ATR   Gummow J cited the principled approach outlined by Hill J in Powell with at least implicit approval  observing that his Honour had further pointed out  at   of Powell   that the decision maker was entitled to  consider not only such matters as go to the issue of serious hardship  but also other matters which  in the discretion of the Board  may be relevant    In my opinion submissions propounded by the Commissioner  which I have sought to outline in detail discretely or in the aggregate  do not vitiate the conclusions of the Tribunal according to law  The Tribunal s conclusions were reasonably open for adoption  being sufficiently founded upon evidentiary material bearing upon the critical statutory issue of serious hardship   including in particular the fraudulent conduct of Mr Milne s former partner in legal practice and its adverse effect upon Mr Milne financially and probably to at least an intangible extent professionally  and the unsaleable character of the Brindabella property for the time being for the reasons I have earlier indicated  It is of course necessary in that regard that the Commissioner s challenge to the factual findings of the Tribunal should establish a viable footing according to principles of administrative law  and the present appeal does not of course operate by way of a re hearing  As I have foreshadowed  I am unable to accept that the Commissioner has distilled administrative error in the juridical sense referrable to the reasoning and findings of the Tribunal  being reasoning and findings which were rationally open for adoption in my opinion according to principles of administrative law  and in particular in the light of the relevant evidentiary material placed before the Tribunal  That material was consistent essentially with the conclusion that any enforced exaction of the outstanding income tax indebtedness of Mr Milne would cause serious hardship within the scope of that notion established for instance in Powell and subsequently in Van Grieken   and as continues in operation in the terms of operation of s     of the Administration Act discussedRe Drake and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  No        ALD   I was next referred by the Commissioner to the assistance to be gained from government statements of policy  as outlined by Brennan J  then a member of the Tribunal  in Re Drake and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  No       ALD   at   and in particular the following     There are powerful considerations in favour of a Minister adopting a guiding policy  It can serve to focus attention on the purpose which the exercise of the discretion is calculated to achieve  and thereby to assist the Minister and others to see more clearly  in each case  the desirability of exercising the power in one way or another  Decision making is facilitated by the guidance given by an adopted policy  and the integrity of decision making in particular cases is the better assured if decisions can be tested against such a policy  By diminishing the importance of individual predilection  an adopted policy can diminish the inconsistencies which might otherwise appear in a series of decisions  and enhance the sense of satisfaction with the fairness and continuity of the administrative process    I draw attention in particular to his Honour s reference to  the guidance given by an adopted policy    Of course the operations of that policy in relation to contemporary values may be a matter of difficulty when it comes to making a judgment in particular cases   Upon the footing of what was described as  those guiding principles and rulings  the Commissioner contended that the Tribunal  misapplied or misinterpreted the statute in relation to the facts proved  since the present was not a case  so it was emphasised  where Mr Milne s  financial difficulty was such that either he or his dependants would be      in significant need warranting action    to relieve their condition   those words cited appearing at   of the Tribunal s decision   The difficulty with that observation of generality lies in its application  and in particular in relation to Mr Milne s family exigencies as well as those of his own personally  involving as they do the need for reasonable accommodation for himself and apparently for two or at least the youngest of his three children  and completion of the education of that youngest child   The Commissioner contended that in dealing with the issue of serious hardship   the Tribunal fell into error  in that the Tribunal     i  failed to consider whether Mr Milne had sufficient equity in his assets to discharge all of his liabilities including the debt due to the Commissioner  without bankruptcy  and relied instead upon the statement of assets and liabilities provided by Mr Milne in September   which however referred to his assets but not his liabilities  that material was said by the Commissioner to have demonstrated an excess of assets over liabilities of   and although Mr Milne subsequently provided an updated statement of assets and liabilities showing his financial position as of November    see in that regard what I have already reproduced in   above  nevertheless on the basis of that statement of assets and liabilities  there was available  equity  in the sum of   to discharge a tax debt of          ii  failed to take into account  adequately or at all  whether Mr Milne or his dependants would be deprived in reality of necessities according to normal community standards  in that regard it was said by the Commissioner that Mr Milne was in the position  at least for the foreseeable future  to earn significant income to provide for the necessities of life for one  or perhaps two  dependent children as well as himself  both the financial statement provided by Mr Milne to the Tribunal on   September   and his updated financial information were further said to have demonstrated that just under one half of his estimated fortnightly expenses would be expended in mortgage payments  if the mortgage was to be discharged upon the sale of the properties at Eastwood and Brindabella  then on Mr Milne s own figures  there would be a fortnightly income surplus  even assuming the payment of a reasonable amount for rent on account of alternative accommodation  whatever that might be  and     iii  concentrated exclusively on what income Mr Milne required to survive on the assumption that he retained all of his assets  yet  according to the Commissioner  there were a number of errors inherent in that approach  in that     a  if Mr Milne s level of expenditure remained approximately the same  and whether or not he was required to pay the amount due to the Commissioner  then absent the sale of his assets  he would face bankruptcy  yet relief of his income tax liability would not alleviate that plight  but would give preference to other creditors       b  no or no proper regard was paid by the Tribunal to the extent of Mr Milne s assets generally  and       c  on Mr Milne s own case  some time within the next three years or so  he would cease to work  in such an event  he would have no income  and in order to discharge other creditors he would be required to sell his assets in any event   The implications of all that were said by the Commissioner to be as follows       i  Division  B of Part VI of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  came into force on   July   by virtue of the Bankruptcy Amendment Act    Cth  and the objects of Division  B of Part VI appear in s  J as follows           a  to require a bankrupt who derives income during the bankruptcy to pay contributions towards the bankrupt s estate  and                  b  to enable the recovery of certain money and property for the benefit of the bankrupt s estate             ii  in general terms  that Division provides for the trustee to assess the amount of a bankrupt s income in each successive year of the bankruptcy  and may establish a liability on the part of the bankrupt  pursuant to an income tax assessment  to make a contribution out of an excess of income assessed over a specified threshold     iii  the threshold amount is defined in terms of the maximum basic rate of pension payable under the Social Security Act    Cth     iv  the liability of a bankrupt to pay a contribution pursuant to his or her trustee s assessment is imposed by s  P  of the Bankruptcy Act   which provides         Subject to s  Q   if the income that a bankrupt is likely to derive during a contribution assessment period as assessed by the trustee under an original assessment exceeds the actual income threshold amount applicable in relation to the bankrupt when that assessment is made  the bankrupt is liable to pay to the trustee a contribution in respect of that period            v  section  P  of the Bankruptcy Act provides for voluntary contributions where the assessed income falls below the threshold amount  s  Q thereof imposes a liability to pay a contribution in respect of a contribution assessment period  where the trustee has made a subsequent assessment which exceeds the actual income threshold amount     vi  the contribution payable by a bankrupt pursuant to that assessment process is defined in s  S of the Bankruptcy Act as follows         The contribution that a bankrupt is liable to pay in respect of a contribution assessment period is the amount worked out in accordance with the formula      Assessed income Actual income threshold amount         where       Assessed income  means the amount assessed by the trustee to be the income that the bankrupt is likely to derive  or derived  during the contribution assessment period       Actual income threshold amount  means the actual income threshold amount assessed by the trustee to be applicable in relation to the bankrupt when the assessment is made            vii  the foregoing concept of  actual income threshold amount  is further defined in s  K on a sliding scale  increased according to the number of dependents that the bankrupt has and the extent of their dependency   the base income threshold amount  is defined in s  K for a particular time as the amount that  at that time  is specified in column   item   Table B  point   B  Pension Rate Calculator A  in the Social Security Act     multiplied by          viii  in the present case  because Mr Milne has more than two dependents  the base income threshold amount is increased by    s  K c  and     ix  once Mr Milne became bankrupt  he would be liable to contribute   of the difference between his actual income  as assessed by the trustee  and the base income threshold amount so increased by   according to the Commissioner s calculations  upon the basis of an assessable annual income of     and two dependent children  the formula in s  K of the Bankruptcy Act required an annual contribution of     or a fortnightly contribution of      being less than half of Mr Milne s fortnightly mortgage payments    Significantly therefore  so the Commissioner submitted  Division  B of the Bankruptcy Act contains within it a mechanism to determine a higher income threshold in cases of hardship  pursuant to s  T  of the Bankruptcy Act   where the trustee has made an assessment of a contribution that a bankrupt is liable to pay and that bankrupt considers that if required to make any such contribution  he or she would suffer hardship  emphasised by the Commissioner incidentally to be  not serious hardship   for any reason or reasons set out in subs  T  then the bankrupt may apply to the trustee for the making of a determination  The reasons which might be operative in the favour of Mr Milne  if made bankrupt  were said to be found within sub paragraphs  a   e  of s  T    which read as follows       a  the bankrupt or the dependent of a bankrupt suffers from an illness or disability that requires on going medical attention and the supply of medicines  and the bankrupt is required to meet a substantial proportion of the costs of that medical attention or those medicines from his or her income               b  the bankrupt is required to make payments from his or her income to meet the cost of child day care to enable the bankrupt to continue in employment or other work       c  the bankrupt is living in rented accommodation that is not provided by  or by an authority of  the Commonwealth  a State or a Territory  or by a local government authority  and the bankrupt is required to pay the cost of that accommodation wholly or mainly from his or her income       d  the bankrupt incurs substantial expense in travelling to and from the bankrupt s place of employment or other work  whether by public transport or otherwise       e  the spouse of the bankrupt  or another person residing with the bankrupt  who ordinarily contributes to the cost of maintaining the bankrupt s household has become unable to contribute to those costs because of unemployment  illness or injury   In summary  it was contended by the Commissioner that the Tribunal failed to consider all of the so called  true effects  which bankruptcy would have had on Mr Milne referred toBond v The Trustee of the Property of Alan Bond  A Bankrupt     FCR   Moreover it was pointed out by the Commissioner that the value of a benefit received by a bankrupt fell within the operation of Subdivision D of Division  B contained in Part VI of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   the Bankruptcy Act   which was said to have two elements  first it requires a bankrupt who derives income during the bankruptcy to pay contributions to his or her bankrupt s estate  secondly  it permits the bankrupt to seek to have contributions reduced in the case of hardship  in that regard I was referred to the circumstances considered by a Full Court  French  Cooper and Carr JJ  in Bond v The Trustee of the Property of Alan Bond  A Bankrupt     FCR   at     and   referred toNew South Wales Bar Association v Murphy   NSWCA         NSWLR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  The test to be applied when determining fitness to hold a practising certificate  in the context of course of bankruptcy  was said by the Commissioner to be  robust  the question not being whether the indebtedness which led to the bankruptcy was brought about by or associated with dishonest conduct by the applicant for a certificate  but whether the circumstances in which the act of bankruptcy was committed were such as to persuade the Council that at the time of its determination  the person is not a fit and proper person to hold a practising certificate  I was referred in that context generally to New South Wales Bar Association v Murphy   NSWCA         NSWLR    There was no material adduced in evidence indicative of any shortcoming in Mr Milne s fitness and propriety to practice as a lawyer   The Commissioner submitted moreover that the Tribunal failed to consider and take into account the provisions relevantly of the LP Act  It was asserted in that regard that on a proper understanding of the meaning of serious hardship   a person such as Mr Milne  who had the capacity to meet his tax liability out of currently held assets  could never satisfy the Commissioner that his circumstances gave rise to the exercise of any discretion in favour of release from tax liability  For that reason alone  it was said by the Commissioner that the Tribunal s decision ought to be set aside  there being no utility in ordering that the matter be remitted to the Tribunal for proper or further consideration  Bearing in mind that the realty here involved in both instances was held jointly with his estranged wife  it would be a formidable exercise to determine what funds  if any  might ultimately be available for payment of the subject outstanding income taxes  and for the satisfaction of the secured creditors of Mr Milne and his wife to the extent of any shortfall on any mortgagee sale  and of her half share in the  equity  of any remaining net proceeds in relation to the sale of their jointly held realty referred toParramatta City Council v Pestell   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Addressing a further basis advanced by the Commissioner for the present administrative review sought  it was contended that on a proper understanding of the two tiered test in subs     of the Administration Act  no reasonable Tribunal could have exercised the statutory discretion to release Mr Milne from his taxation liability  Reference was made by the Commissioner in that regard to the grant of administrative relief made available in Parramatta City Council v Pestell   HCA         CLR   which related to a local Council s imposition of a rate because of the special benefit flowing from the Council s execution of a particular work or service on public property  and which the High Court affirmed to be invalid  It was argued by the Commissioner conversely that the factual circumstances of a high income earner having substantial assets  sufficient in value to meet all current liabilities  could not reasonably fall within the statutory notion of serious hardship   It is normally a formidable task to establish that the decision of an administrative decision maker satisfies that test of invalidity  The Commissioner advanced the further case that the exercise of the Tribunal s power to release Mr Milne was unreasonable  in that on the evidence placed before it  no reasonable person could have come to the conclusions reached by the Tribunal in its decision the subject of appeal  I was referred again to Peko Wallsend where at   Mason J discussed the scope of the principle of Wednesbury unreasonableness  I would make a similar observation upon that submission to that which I have made in relation to satisfaction of the test in Pestell
