Cockrell v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toLi Shi Ping v Minister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethnic Affairs     ALD   The second way in which the applicant sought to characterise the error was to claim that it led the Tribunal member to fail to take into account a relevant consideration  namely  the Federal Magistrates Court s views as to the best interests of Jedi  In my opinion  there are two answers to this submission  First  it is clear that the Tribunal member was in no way bound by the views of the Federal Magistrates Court  The relevant consideration was the best interests of the child  not the view of the Federal Magistrates Court as to the best interests of the child  At best  the latter was an item of evidence that may be relevant to that consideration   Li Shi Ping v Minister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethnic Affairs     ALD   at      Secondly  even if the implicit view of the Federal Magistrates Court was a relevant consideration it is a consideration the Tribunal member was permitted but not bound to take into account  The Tribunal member was bound to make up his own mind about the best interests of Jedi having regard to the matters in the direction and his inquiry involved an examination of the range of matters referred to in the direction   For these reasons  I reject the applicant s first submission   The applicant also referred to the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility introduced by the Family Law Amendment  Shared Parental Responsibility  Act    Cth   He referred to ss  DA and  DB which are in the following terms     DA Presumption of equal shared parental responsibility when making parenting orders         When making a parenting order in relation to a child  the court must apply a presumption that it is in the best interests of the child for the child s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child            Note  The presumption provided for in this subsection is a presumption that relates solely to the allocation of parental responsibility for a child as defined in section  B  It does not provide for a presumption about the amount of time the child spends with each of the parents  this issue is dealt with in section  DAA               The presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent of the child  or a person who lives with a parent of the child  has engaged in             a  abuse of the child or another child who  at the time  was a member of the parent s family  or that other person s family  or   b  family violence              When the court is making an interim order  the presumption applies unless the court considers that it would not be appropriate in the circumstances for the presumption to be applied when making that order     The presumption may be rebutted by evidence that satisfies the court that it would not be in the best interests of the child for the child s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child          DB Application of presumption of equal shared parental responsibility after interim parenting order made       If there is an interim parenting order in relation to a child  the court must  in making a final parenting order in relation to the child  disregard the allocation of parental responsibility made in the interim order referred toMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The applicant s submission that the Tribunal member misunderstood the nature of the discretion in s   of the Act must be rejected  It is true that he did appear to misstate the nature of the discretion in that part of his reasons which I have summarised above   but his reasons must be read as a whole and not with an eye keenly attuned to error  Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR   at      The Tribunal member was clearly alert to the nature of the discretion he was called upon to exercise  At the beginning of his reasons he said the only issue before him was whether the discretion to cancel the visa should be exercised and he concluded his reasons by saying that he had decided that it was appropriate to exercise the discretion under s   of the Act to cancel the applicant s visa  Furthermore  throughout his reasons  and  in particular when addressing the three primary considerations  the Tribunal member referred to a particular factor as one favouring a decision to cancel the applicant s visa   I do not think that the Tribunal member misunderstood the nature of the discretion   The applicant submits that in his analysis of other relevant considerations  the Tribunal member should have  but did not take into account the following       Articles   and   of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  New York    th December   Australian Treaty Series   No   and Articles     and   of the Convention on the Rights of the Child  New York    November   Australian Treaty Series   No      The hardship which would be suffered by the applicant if he was to lose contact with his son  and     The fact that the applicant was not warned that if he committed serious offences he may jeopardise his visa referred toMinister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlreferred toRocca v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALD   The Tribunal member commenced his examination of the third primary consideration by summarising the relevant paragraphs in the direction  He noted that the applicant s submissions focused on the best interests of his son  Jedi  At the time of the hearing before the Tribunal  he was   months old  The applicant submitted that he was being denied access to his son  and that if his visa was cancelled  there would be virtually no way in which future access or contact could be made  The applicant gave evidence that he wanted to remain in Australia so that he could form a meaningful relationship with his son  He submitted that his son would be disadvantaged if he grew up without a father  He referred to the evidence of Mr Tuddenham and he submitted that he was African American and that it was his desire to share his cultural background with his son  The Tribunal member referred to certain observations of Gray J in Rocca v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALD    The Tribunal member then said    The applicant referred to the fact that Ms Fraser had consented to the contact orders for Jedi made in the Federal Magistrates Court  The Tribunal draws no adverse inferences from the fact that Ms Fraser so consented  Nor does the Tribunal accept the applicant s submission that  by granting the contact orders by consent  the Court was articulating that the best interests of the child would be served by allowing him to have contact with his father   The orders referred to in the above passage were orders made by the Federal Magistrates Court on   May   and   September   respectively  The orders made on   May   were interim orders made by consent and until final order  The orders made on   September   were final orders  The orders deal with the relationship between Jedi and each of his parents  namely  the applicant and Ms Fraser  The orders are set out below       The Tribunal member then referred to the evidence of Mr Tuddenham and the evidence of Mr Courtney  In relation to the evidence of Mr Tuddenham  he said that Mr Tuddenham did not bring any formal qualification to the hearing of the matter and he concluded that his views did not greatly assist him  In relation to Mr Courtney  he found him to be  a most unimpressive witness
