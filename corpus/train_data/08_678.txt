contravention of s  E are  for present purposes  substantially identical  What is required is that the Court be satisfied  in the language of s   that the union or the person concerned       c  has aided  abetted  counselled or procured a person to contravene such a provision  or          d  has induced  or attempted to induce  a person  whether by threats or promises or otherwise  to contravene

contravene such a provision        Common to these alternatives is the requirement that the alleged accessory acted with knowledge of the essential matters which went to make up the contravention

s   civil penalty proceedings purposes  This matter has been considered at length in CEPU at      Section   proceedings are civil proceedings  As such  by virtue of s   of the Evidence Act    Cth  it attracts the civil standard of proof on the balance of probabilities  Accordingly  I must be satisfied that the ACCC has established that the circumstances appearing in the evidence gave rise to a reasonable and definite inference  not merely to conflicting inferences of equal degrees of probability  that BLL and the CFMEU  an officer of the CFMEU  or an agent of the CFMEU or of an officer thereof  made one or more arrangements or arrived at one or more understandings within the meaning of s  E  CEPU at     I will later in these reasons make a number of rulings on evidentiary matters  For ease in exposition I will here refer to evidence which may be in issue  but without prejudice to what I have to say later appliedCadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The case law in this country is discordant on whether one party to a proceedings can seek to tender admissions made in a witness statement or affidavit filed and served by another party in that proceeding pursuant to rule of court or court order  but who does not call the maker of that statement or read that affidavit  On one view  the statement or affidavit remains subject to legal professional privilege  on the other  filing and service operates  without more  as a full or limited waiver  see generally Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd   FCA   at       where the case law has been helpfully reviewed by Gordon J   I am prepared to assume for present purposes that Sutton and Noonan s communications with the CFMEU s and Noonan s solicitors for the purpose of preparing their statements were confidential communications  cf Cadbury at    The statements themselves were filed and served for the purposes of the proceedings pursuant to a number of directions made by Gyles J  Their service on the ACCC was subject to the implied undertaking given by the parties to the Court not to use any document produced to them in the course of the proceeding otherwise than in relation to the proceeding  see Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Plowman   HCA         CLR    The use proposed by the ACCC in this case raises no issue in relation to the implied undertaking  cf Cadbury at      The only question arising from that use is one of privilege  Assuming the statements to be privileged prior to service  whether or not it subsists after their service falls to be determined by the common law and not by the Evidence Act   the provisions of that Act having no applications to a disclosure so made  cf s     The reasoning of the Full Court  as Gordon J noted in Cadbury at   is persuasive and sensible and it leads to the conclusion that  save where a disclosure is made for a particular and limited purpose  the filing and service operates as a complete  and not simply limited  waiver of privilege  at     for the reason that the uses that may be made of the served document in the proceedings are  inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect  Mann v Carnell   HCA         CLR   at    appliedLiberty Funding Pty Ltd v Phoenix Capital Ltd     ALR   As I am in entire agreement with the conclusions reached by her Honour on the proper approach to be taken to the question in a case such as the present particularly in light of observations made by the Full Court of this Court in Liberty Funding Pty Ltd v Phoenix Capital Ltd     ALR   at   my comments will be brief   As the Full Court observed in Liberty Funding in endorsing the approach of Barrett J in Austress Freyssinet Pty Ltd v Marlin International Pty Ltd   NSWSC   that a party could tender  as an admission  parts of an affidavit sworn by the opposing party  at   Thus  it is necessary to posit a limited waiver  within a broad framework of the conduct of proceedings  which may bring about the result  as in Austress  that it is in the other side s power to destroy the privilege entirely by putting the statement or affidavit into evidence or examining or cross examining on its contents   Their Honours went on to point out  at   This so called  limited waiver  by service such that the privilege is waived only for the purpose of the legal proceedings in question might be seen to be no more than the operation of the implied undertaking dealt with in Harman  and Esso    I agree with her Honour s view of the approach that Liberty Funding mandates  It is the implied undertaking  not privilege  which in this case limits the use the ACCC can make of the statements  but that use is not inconsistent with  or precluded by  the undertaking  The tender is in the proceedings in which the statements were served   I should add the following  First  I am satisfied having regard both to his stated position and responsibilities in   and to the manner of his participation in events in this matter  that it is reasonably open to find that Sutton had authority to make representations on behalf of the CFMEU in relation to the matters the subject of his statement  see Evidence Act   s  a  and  b   I should emphasise that to the extent that his statement contains admissions  they can only be used against the CFMEU  Evidence Act   s     Secondly  I also am satisfied that Hensley s statement can be used against the CFMEU to the extent that it contains admissions  It is reasonably open to find that he had authority to act for the CFMEU in relation to the matters in which he participated and that the representations he made were within the scope of that authority  s  b   Such admissions as he made are also able to be used in the case against him personally citedEsso Australia Resources Ltd v Plowman   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I am prepared to assume for

http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  I will assume the answers given to the ACCC by Sutton and Lancsar were confidential in the sense that they were given  a  in relation to one of the limited matters specified in s   of the TP Act and  b  in furtherance of the performance of the ACCC s functions under the TP Act in relation to those matters  but not otherwise  cf Smith Kline   French Laboratories  Aust  Ltd v Department of Community Services and Health   FCA         FCR   at    This said  the use proposed to be made of the information so provided falls squarely within the scope of the purpose for which the answers were given  ie the ACCC s enforcement of the Act in respect of an alleged contravention of it  The information was not said to be the subject of any privilege  And while the answers were given under compulsion of law  ss   and  A  there is no statutory preclusion of their use in civil as distinct from criminal  s   proceedings  Accordingly  to the extent that they contain admissions of a party to these proceedings  they are admissible against that party in accordance with the provisions of the Evidence Act   see ss       and      As I am not satisfied that the ACCC has established any of the contraventions of s  E which it has alleged  no question of the accessorial liability of the first  third and fourth respondents arises  Accordingly
