Jovicic v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toDagli v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The applicant submitted that the issues paper presented to the Minister to facilitate his decision making  contained misleading statements which the applicant should have been given an opportunity to correct  The applicant submitted that failure to do so resulted in a breach of procedural fairness which can result in the decision being set aside  see Johnson v Williams   FCA     R v Kylsant     KB   and Dagli v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR    The material errors of fact and law pleaded in the second further amended statement of claim included those relating to the statements that the applicant s citizenship was the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  and that he  would be entitled to apply for a new Yugoslav passport    Secondly  the issues paper incorrectly stated that he had not made any claims that required assessment in relation to international obligations in circumstances where he had made the following claims  The applicant had claimed that in the event that his visa was cancelled and he was deported to the then current Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that he had no family ties or friends in that country  limited knowledge of the language and vocabulary and no financial support  He had also claimed that the deportation was likely to have a devastating effect on his then successful rehabilitation from drug addiction  perhaps causing his relationship with his de facto to end or causing him to commit suicide  He claimed that he would have extreme difficulties in finding employment and that he did not hold a current travel document to enter the then current Federal Republic of Yugoslavia   The applicant submitted that these claims required assessment in relation to international obligations including those under the ICCPR and the CSSP and that to have proceeded based on the errors in the issues paper was not a course obviously open on the known material and the applicant could not reasonably have been expected to have been aware of it   The last issue is whether the issues paper was misleading and enlivened the obligation to invite comment as discussed in Dagli   It was said to be misleading in two respects  Firstly that the applicant was a citizen of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and would appear to be entitled to apply for a new Yugoslavian passport  Secondly that the applicant had not made any claims that required assessment in relation to international obligations  For the reasons discussed in the preceding paragraph  the issues paper was not misleading in this second respect  That leads to a consideration of whether it was misleading in the first respect and  if so  should the applicant have been invited to comment   The judgment of the Full Court in Dagli reinforced  in the context of decision making under s     the principle that a person is entitled to an opportunity to comment on adverse material provided to the decision maker by others  and the failure to provide an opportunity constitutes a denial of procedural fairness  As illustrated by the recent Full Court judgment in VKAC   that adverse material can include assertions in an issues paper about the citizenship of the person whose visa is at risk of cancellation  However  as Mansfield and North JJ noted in VKAC  at   the comment in the issues paper in the matter  that the appellant was a Burmese citizen  was adverse because it removed from consideration the position advanced by the appellant  a contention of substance based on probative material  that she was stateless and could not be returned to Burma   The present case is different  At no point did the applicant contend that he was stateless or  additionally  that he could not be removed to Serbia or any contemporary manifestation of Yugoslavia  Thus the statement that he was a  Yugoslav citizen  and  later in the issues paper  that he would be  entitled to apply for a new Yugoslav passport  did not constitute adverse material as it did not impeach or have the potential to impeach the case he had advanced in opposition to the cancellation of his visa   The application should be dismissed with costs      I certify that the preceding thirty two   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the

Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom   HCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  These proceedings were commenced on   December   as an application for a declaration that the applicant  who had been removed from Australia  was entitled to an absorbed person visa pursuant to s   of the Migration Act    Cth   the Act   The applicant also sought an order that the respondents arrange the return of the applicant to Australia  a declaration of wrongful imprisonment and damages  Since then  a number of events have occurred which have altered the issues that need to be determined  First  the applicant has been returned to Australia by the Commonwealth  Secondly  the High Court has given judgment allowing an appeal against a judgment of a Full Court of this Court  The Full Court s judgment underpinned part of the case originally advanced by the applicant  The parties agreed that judgment in this matter could be reserved until the High Court gave its judgment  The High Court gave judgment  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Nystrom   HCA     on   November    The judgment of the High Court had the effect of removing two of the grounds relied on by the applicant  The High Court s judgment is discussed shortly   The facts agreed upon by the parties were as follows  The applicant was born in Paris  France on   December   to parents who were then both citizens of Yugoslavia  In   when the applicant was two years of age  his parents migrated to Australia with him and his siblings  The applicant and his family members were granted permanent entry permits on their arrival into Australia  In   the applicant s parents became Australian citizens  The applicant was not included in his parents  application for citizenship  From   September   to   November   the applicant travelled with his father to that part of Yugoslavia which  up until very recently  was known as Serbia and Montenegro  and then returned to Australia as the holder of an old visa of a kind known as a  Return Endorsement    On   September   the applicant became the holder of a transitional  permanent  visa by operation of reg   the Migration Reform  Transitional Provisions  Regulations    Cth   Between   and   the applicant was convicted of a number of criminal offences  On   October   the then Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs made a decision pursuant to s   of the Act to cancel the applicant s transitional  permanent  visa  The applicant was removed from Australia on   June     Before the decision of the High Court in Nystrom the principal ground relied on by the applicant was that he held an absorbed person visa by operation of s   of the Act and that the failure of the Minister to take into account that he held that visa gave rise to jurisdictional error  One of the statutory criteria for that visa was that the applicant had not  on or after   April   left Australia  The Minister contended this criterion had not been satisfied by the applicant having regard to his travel to Yugoslavia in late    Submissions were directed to the meaning of  left Australia    Another argument advanced by the applicant was that s   and not s   was the applicable source of the power on which the Minister might have acted and that there was a direct repugnance between s   and ss   and   with the result that the first respondent s decision was vitiated by jurisdictional error   It is not necessary to consider those arguments in light of the High Court s decision which held that where a person held two visas  the same visas the applicant contends he held in this matter  each of which conferred the same substantive rights  in cancelling one the Minister was not bound to take into account the  nature  of the other because there was no consideration relevant to the applicant s absorbed person visa which was not relevant to and considered when the Minister cancelled his transitional  permanent  visa  at   per Heydon and Crennan JJ   Gummow and Hayne JJ held that nothing in the text of s   or s  F provided any support for reading into s   a requirement to consider the possible effect of s  F on the visa holder  at    Even if the applicant held an absorbed person visa in addition to his transitional  permanent  visa  s  F  operates to cancel the absorbed person visa   The other issues which Nystrom resolved concerned whether there was repugnancy between ss   and   and s   of the Act  The issue was whether s   of the Act  as a general provision  yielded to the more specific provisions in s   and s   governing the deportation of non citizens who have committed criminal offences with the result that the Minister had no power to cancel a visa under s   in circumstances governed by s   and s     The High Court in Nystrom rejected this proposition and held that  at   per Gummow and Hayne JJ       the two powers do not deal with the same subject matter so as to attract the operation of the maxim expressum facit cessare tacitum and the reasoning which underpins Anthony Hordern and other decisions  The scheme of the Principal Act does not treat as having the one identity deportation and cancellation of a visa  This is so notwithstanding that  by reason of other provisions of the Principal Act  the exercise of both powers may well result in the same practical outcome     and at   and       The powers in s   and s   have different provenances  and persons in respect of whom a deportation order has been made have a different status and different rights under the Principal Act  Those differences cannot be ignored by an ellipsis which regards s   and s   as directed to the same practical outcome          Section   and ss   and   have different consequences for the status of individuals in the context of the Principal Act  Where a deportation order is made  the individual has the status of a lawful non citizen who is subject to deportation  If an order under s   be made  the status of the individual changes to that of unlawful non citizen  The Principal Act attaches significance to each status    Accordingly it is not open to characterise the powers as dealing with the same subject matter in the sense of the Anthony Hordern line of cases  In the circumstances of this case  the inapplicability of s    by reason of non satisfaction of s  b i  cannot deny the application of s   by reference to s  a    The remaining grounds in this matter concern the procedures adopted by the Minister in reaching the decision to cancel the applicant s transitional  permanent  visa   The applicant submitted that Direction   required the decision maker to consider certain international obligations found in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  ICCPR   Direction   was made under s   of the Act which provides that the Minister may give directions to a person or body about the performance of functions under the Act or as to the exercise of powers under the Act  but such a direction must not be inconsistent with the Act or the Migration Regulations    Cth   A person or body receiving the direction must comply with the direction  Direction   concerns  visa refusal and cancellation under section   of the Migration Act     referred toMinogue v Human Rights   Equal Opportunity Commission   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The applicant submitted that the intention to proceed on the basis that no claims had been made out which might be affected by the implicit non refoulement obligation was inconsistent with the legitimate expectation that the Minister would act in conformity with the ICCPR  There was an expectation that if the Minister proposed to act in a manner which was not consistent with Australia s obligations under the ICCPR  that he would be afforded procedural fairness in relation to this intention and given the opportunity to argue against that course  Reference was made to Minogue v Human Rights   Equal Opportunity Commission   FCA         FCR   at      The Minister submitted that the applicant had not in fact made claims that required assessment in relation to international obligations  The Minister submitted that the applicant s claims did not show or reasonably show that he would suffer subjection to torture or cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment by someone in Serbia   Article   of the ICCPR provides    No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel  inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment  In particular  no one shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or scientific experimentation   The applicant submitted that the Minister was required to consider Australia s international obligations under Art   of the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons  CSSP  and that if he proposed to depart from that  the applicant was entitled to notice and that he had a legitimate expectation that he would be given an opportunity to argue against that course being taken  Minogue   Article   provides that    The Contracting States shall not expel a stateless person lawfully in their territory save on grounds of national security or public order   As the Full Court noted in Minogue   the authority relied on by counsel for the applicant  the notion that departure from a course that a person has an expectation will be followed  is an aspect of procedural fairness  Even making a range of assumptions in the applicant s favour about the contents of the two international instruments and that an expectation of the type asserted had been raised in a general sense  the applicant singularly failed to provide the Minister with any information which might reasonably have caused the Minister not to decide to cancel the applicant s visa because of the instruments  In substance  the factual case now called in aid to establish that there would have been an expectation that the Minister would act in a particular way  was a case never raised with the Minister before he made the impugned decision  There was no unfairness  see Lam at      At best  it would be a case based on facts now known and advanced by the applicant in these proceedings referred toRe Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  Ex parte Lam   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Minister submitted that  following the decision in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  Ex parte Lam   HCA         CLR   the applicant must do more than simply identify an expectation that a particular treaty would be applied  The applicant must identify some respect in which he suffered a practical injustice because of the procedure that was followed  The Minister submitted that even if the Court were to find that the applicant was stateless the applicant could not have had a legitimate expectation that the Minister would consider obligations arising under the CSSP because the CSSP was not one of the international instruments expressly referred to in Direction     As the Full Court noted in Minogue   the authority relied on by counsel for the applicant  the notion that departure from a course that a person has an expectation will be followed  is an aspect of procedural fairness  Even making a range of assumptions in the applicant s favour about the contents of the two international instruments and that an expectation of the type asserted had been raised in a general sense  the applicant
