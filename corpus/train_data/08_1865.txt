Ferdinands v Chief of Army   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toFerdinands v The Chief of Army   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The question of impecuniosity  of course  is always a relevant factor for a person who is unrepresented and who happens to be in those circumstances  However  the authorities are clear that impecuniosity itself is not a basis on which a party is relieved of the obligation to prosecute his application diligently  Ferdinands v The Chief of Army   FCAFC   at     Moreover  the failure of the applicant to obtain a solicitor or counsel who satisfies what he says is a test of honesty and decency cannot be a ground for or an excuse for the applicant failing to bring the application within the time prescribed by the High Court Rules   In the end  I think it not unfair to say that no real explanation has been given for the delay  notwithstanding that this proceeding was commenced more than two years ago   The applicant has been convicted in the Adelaide Magistrates Court and by a Defence Force Magistrate  The thrust of the applicant s complaints is that Brigadier Appleton wrongly took into account those convictions and the circumstances surrounding those convictions  Rather  Brigadier Appleton should have  it is asserted  ignored the convictions because the convictions ought to be set aside   The proceeding which was commenced in the High Court is patently an abuse of process in that it seeks by the application for the issue of the constitutional writs to set aside a conviction in the Adelaide Magistrates Court and a conviction by a Defence Force Magistrate citedGallo v Dawson     ALR   Both Mr Ferdinands and Dr Bleby  who appeared for the respondents  referred me to Gallo v Dawson     ALR    In Gallo v Dawson   ALR     McHugh J set out discussing the then High Court Rules relating to an extension of time at   The grant of an extension of time under this rule is not automatic  The object of the rule is to ensure that those Rules which fix times for doing acts do not become instruments of injustice  The discretion to extend time is given for the sole purpose of enabling the court or justice to do justice between the parties  see Hughes v National Trustees Executors   Agency Co of Australasia Ltd   VR   at    This means that the discretion can only be exercised in favour of an applicant upon proof that strict compliance with the rules will work an injustice upon the applicant  In order to determine whether the rules will work an injustice  it is necessary to have regard to the history of the proceedings  the conduct of the parties  the nature of the litigation  and the consequences for the parties of the grant or refusal of the application for extension of time  see Avery v No   Public Service Appeal Board     NZLR   at   Jess v Scott     FCR   at       ALR    When the application is for an extension of time in which to file an appeal  it is always necessary to consider the prospects of the applicant succeeding in the appeal  see Burns v Grigg   VR   at   Hughes  at     Mitchelson v Mitchelson     ALR   at     I accept  of course  that all of those matters are relevant  Those matters were all referred to by McHugh J in Gallo v Dawson   ALR    But they are  I think  of less importance than the two primary issues which must be determined  The primary issues are first  the explanation for the delay and secondly  the prospects of the applicant succeeding on the substantive application   The applicant has filed four affidavits in support of the application for an extension of time  In an affidavit sworn on   May   he says         With regard to Extension of Time matters  I say that time should be and will be extended until I can find a legal practitioner that is honest and decent and can step forward and assist the High Court of Australia in these matters of fraud and racial hatred of employees in the Department of Defence   In his last affidavit  which was sworn on   October   he asserts that he believes that he has acted within a reasonable time  He says in that affidavit that the delay has been caused by              E xtreme poverty and hardship and trying to get the respondents to actively engage in serious issues such as professional misconduct  process corruption and hate crimes without using the courts citedRe Commonwealth  Ex parte Marks   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Re Commonwealth  Ex parte Marks   HCA         ALR     McHugh J was concerned with an application for the issue of the writs of certiorari and mandamus in circumstances where the application was   months out of time for the issue of certiorari and   months out of time for the issue of mandamus  a similar delay to the period in this proceeding   McHugh J said that the grant of an extension of time is not automatic whether the substantive application is for constitutional relief or by way of an appeal  He said  at   A  case would need to be exceptional  before the time for commencing proceedings was enlarged by many months  The explanation for such a delay is also a relevant consideration   McHugh J said that he needed to take into account the explanation for the delay and  where the application is for an extension of time  the prospects of the application succeeding
