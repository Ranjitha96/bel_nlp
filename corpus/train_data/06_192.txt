Knight v Beyond Properties Pty Ltd  No     FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedBishop v Bridgelands Securities Ltd   ATPR SS     In fact  in Bishop v Bridgelands Securities Ltd   ATPR SS     Wilcox J held that para  b  was not limited by reference to para  a  of r    I respectfully agree  Nonetheless  the first inquiry will always be whether the terms of para  a  are satisfied  If so  the Court will proceed to consider discretionary factors of the kind mentioned above  If not  the Court may still be persuaded in the particular circumstances of the case to exercise the discretion by granting leave  as happened in Bishop v Bridgelands  above   Mr Knight could not have joined S   S and Wiley at the outset because the facts giving rise to his claims against them  the publishing of the two books  occurred subsequently   If a separate proceeding were brought by Mr Knight against S   S and Wiley  it appears that some common questions of law and fact would arise in that proceeding and the present proceeding  see para  i  of r  a  namely  questions relating to Mr Knight s reputation in Australia in connection with the name  MYTHBUSTERS   Apparently this will be a strongly contested issue in this proceeding  It may be  however  that even in relation to this issue  there would be differences between the two proceedings  one proceeding relating to Mr Knight s reputation with television viewers and the other relating to his reputation with the buyers and readers of books citedPayne v Young   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The rights to relief claimed in the two proceedings would clearly not be  in respect of or arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions  cf Payne v Young   HCA         CLR    The evidentiary fields which would be covered by Mr Knight s claim against Beyond  Discovery  SBS and Foxtel in connection with the television series  and that covered by his claim against S   S and Wiley in connection with publication of the two books  would  it seems  be quite different   The inconvenience to the two groups of respondents of having to participate in a hearing in which a substantial number of the issues and a substantial part of the evidence would be no concern of theirs  must be weighed against the inconvenience to Mr Knight of having to prove his reputation  or reputations  in separate proceedings   In my view  the weighing exercise favours the respondents  Mr Knight would not have been entitled under O   r   to join the publishers as respondents in this proceeding initially  and he should not be allowed to do so now
