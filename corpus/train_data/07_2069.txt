  FCR    The findings set out at paragraphs  b  and  b  above constitute events of default pursuant to O  A r  b   The findings set out at paragraphs  b  and  b  above constitute events of default pursuant to O  A r  a  appliedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline Net Au Pty Ltd     ALR   To similar effect  Kiefel J s analysis of the effect of Order  A  at first instance  in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dataline Net Au Pty Ltd     ALR   at   appears to assume implicitly that notice of the default judgment proceedings is not necessary unless the relief ultimately being sought is different to that expressed in the statement of claim  Her Honour indicated that the touchstone ought to be fairness in the conduct of litigation  with what is required potentially differing from case to case   I have found that the eighty third and ninety second respondents have been served with the originating process and have made no  or no proper  effort  to respond to the Court s processes  No injustice would be occasioned by entering default judgment against them   Older precedent reflects a certain reluctance to grant declaratory relief in the absence of facts found on evidence  Contemporary authority in this court reflects a strong disinclination to follow those earlier decisions  In Dataline   Kiefel J  reviewed much of that earlier authority  Her Honour observed at         The question is whether declarations should be made on deemed admissions  given that there has been no adjudication by the court on the facts and the declarations may give the impression that there has      The power to grant declarations  s   Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  is unconfined  Order  A itself imposes no constraints upon the relief sought  Refusals to make declarations in cases of default are based upon a practice  not a rule of law  The practice is one of long standing and might be seen as derived from views about litigation which pre date more recent concerns expressed by the courts as to the costs of unnecessary litigation  the management of cases and efficiency overall  Views expressed in older cases may not take account of the increase in the use made of declaratory orders in developing areas of law which may involve matters of public interest  emphasis added   A caution with respect to the use of older authority is made in the White Book Service   to the English Civil Procedure Rules             It may no longer be correct to have a practice which operates as a prohibition in every case of default and preferable to consider the circumstances pertaining to the particular case and the purpose and effect of the declaration     Cases such as this  involving the protection of consumers  are of public interest  Declarations are often utilised in such cases to identify for the public what conduct constitutes a contravention and to make apparent that it is considered to warrant an order recognising its seriousness  emphasis added   It is however important that there be no misunderstanding as to the basis upon which they are made  This could be overcome by a statement  preceding the declarations  that orders are made  upon admissions which  the respondent in question  is taken to have made  consequent upon non compliance with orders of the court  appliedBank of Kuwait and the Middle East v The Ship MV  Mawashi Al Gasseem   No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  To similar effect is the judgment of Mansfield J in Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v The Ship MV  Mawashi Al Gasseem   No     FCA     which was  like Dataline   a case where judgment was given on the basis of deemed admissions under O  A  Having noted the historical reluctance to base declarations on admissions  his Honour went on to approve and adopt the statements of Kiefel J in Dataline and to exercise his discretion to make declarations on the basis of those deemed admissions  at       Accordingly I propose to make the declarations sought  predicated by a statement that they are made on the basis of deemed admissions referred toBritish American Tobacco Australasia Limited v The Person Identified by the Australian Customs Service as  Gory Sabar    FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In British American Tobacco Australasia Limited v The Person Identified by the Australian Customs Service as  Gory Sabar    FCA     an application was made for judgment under Order  A  It appears that this application may have been made by a notice of motion  which was made returnable instanter   and Stone J made orders  pursuant to Order   rule  d  that service of this Notice of Motion be dispensed with   These orders were made despite the fact that neither of the respondents had filed a notice of appearance  or had appeared before the Court at any stage   Stone J went on to find that the respondents were in default under O  A r  a  and  c  and proceeded to enter judgment against them  notwithstanding that there was no evidence that they were aware of the hearing seeking default judgment  Notice of that hearing had not been personally served

defaulters   I have had the benefit of very detailed and helpful written submissions from which I have drawn  in compiling these reasons   Orders of the following kind are sought against the defaulters       a  a declaration that each of the four defaulters engaged in unlawful industrial action in contravention of s   of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act    Cth   BCII Act  during the period   February   to   March   inclusive  the Period     b  an order imposing a pecuniary penalty on each of the four defaulters pursuant to s  a  of the BCII Act for engaging in unlawful industrial action during the Period     c  an order suspending part of the pecuniary penalty in each case pursuant to the general power under s c  of the BCII Act     d  an order pursuant to

defaulters       h  an order that each of the respondents pay the applicant s costs in the sum of   in respect of costs of the Notice of Motion for default judgment against each of them   I have in these proceedings previously made declarations in relation to the other respondents by reference to Statements of Agreed Facts  Hadgkiss v Aldin   FCA     The defaulters are deemed to have made admissions of the facts pleaded in the Statement of Claim  Declaratory relief as against the defaulters in those circumstances is not materially different to the position of the other respondents who are signatories to the Statements of Agreed Facts   I propose that  for the same reasons  the same penalties be imposed on each of the defaulters  as was imposed in relation to the main body of respondents identified in Schedule   to my earlier reasons  Hadgkiss v Aldin   FCA     Accordingly I will impose the following penalties         a  in respect of each of the defaulters  for the deemed admitted contraventions of s   of the BCII Act  a penalty of   of which   should be payable within   days and the balance of   suspended for six months  to be paid only if the respondent further contravenes the BCII Act or the WR Act during the period of the suspension  and   b  in respect of the second and third respondents for the further deemed admitted breaches of the s   order  an additional penalty of   of which   should be payable within   days and the balance of   suspended for six months  upon similar terms   Costs ought follow the event  Although the WR Act is a no costs jurisdiction  there is no such provision in the BCII Act  Agreement was reached with the primary group of respondents who admitted contraventions that there would be no order as to costs  No such agreement has been reached with these respondents  The defaulters have failed to either file an appearance or a defence in the proceedings and the applicant has incurred additional legal costs as a
