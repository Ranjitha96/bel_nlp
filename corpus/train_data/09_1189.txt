Fowler v Airservices Australia   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chats House Investments Pty Limited     FCR  As Branson J said in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chats House Investments Pty Limited     FCR   at     it is appropriate for the Court to be satisfied that any settlement or discontinuance of representative proceedings has been undertaken in the interests of the group members as a whole  and not just in the interests of the applicant and the respondent    The Court s task is to assess whether the compromise is fair and reasonable   Lopez v Star World Enterprises Pty Limited   ATPR         FCA   at   per Finkelstein J  appliedDarwalla Milling Co Pty Ltd v F Hoffman La Roche Ltd  No       ALR  The approach to be taken by the Court was recently reviewed by Jessup J in Darwalla Milling Co Pty Ltd v F Hoffman La Roche Ltd  No       ALR    Jessup J pointed out that there is little specificity that can be attached to the words  fair  or  reasonable   His Honour expressed the opinion that the practical judicial approach appears to be to identify any features of a settlement that are obviously unreasonable or unfair   Darwalla at    The evidence establishes that the proposed global amount  the methodology for distribution and the effect of the settlement on the payments to be made to the individual members has been adequately set forth to each of those members of the Deacons client group  As was the case in Darwalla  no objection  and no matter said to be unfair or unreasonable  has been raised in this case by any group member who will be covered by the settlement  As a result  I  like Jessup J in Darwalla   am left with only the broadest criteria to assess the reasonableness and fairness of the proposed settlement  Global settlement sum Jessup J considered whether the overall settlement sum was reasonable having regard to  the manner of its calculation and its relationship to the best possible case outcome for the group as a whole  the prospects of achieving an outcome at or near the best probable case  the extent of the weaknesses  substantive or procedural  in the applicant s case  whether the settlement sum falls within the realistic range of likely outcomes  the forensic difficulties which would be involved in the conduct of the case to judgment  and the time and costs which have been saved by a settlement at that particular stage of the proceedings   Darwalla at    As noted by Jacobson J in Taylor v Telstra Corporation Ltd   FCA   at     Jessup J also said at   that he did not consider that it was the Court s function under s  V to second guess the applicants  advisors in the answer to the question whether the applicants ought to have accepted the respondent s offer  The question is whether the agreed settlement falls within the range of a fair and reasonable outcome  taking everything into account  As Jessup J also pointed out in Darwalla   there is rarely  if ever  a case in which there is a unique outcome which should be regarded as the only fair and reasonable one  As in Darwalla   there is a settlement distribution scheme which does not specify precisely what the final entitlement of each group member will be under the settlement  although in this case citedHaslam v Money For Living  Aust

Limited   ATPR         FCA   at   per Finkelstein J   The evidence provides a basis for calculating the total claims made by or on behalf of the Deacons clients and the percentage of these total claims made up by the individual claims of each Deacons client  This percentage is used to calculate the proportion of the global settlement sum to be paid to each Deacons client  allowing for costs  This enables the Court to understand the basis on which the amounts payable to the individual members of the group have been calculated  Where the global settlement and the method of distribution have been established  the fact that there is a degree of uncertainty in the precise distribution does not prevent approval being given to the settlement   Lopez    There has already been payment by the Deacons clients on account of costs incurred to date  The proposed schedule for distribution takes account of those payments of costs and it follows that the individual group members have been notified of  and approve the quantum of  the costs incurred  I am satisfied that there is no need for further evidence of the reasonableness of those costs  Accordingly  taking account of  the percentage of each claim to be paid to each Deacons client  the prospects of success in the proceedings affecting the likelihood that any Deacons client would obtain judgment for amounts significantly in excess of the settlement offer  the increased costs that would be incurred if the matter proceeded to its conclusion  the opinion of Mr Sharma  the fact that the proposed settlement was recommended by senior and junior counsel for the Deacons clients  the submissions of and support of the settlement by Ms Wilson  appearing for the Deacons clients  the submissions of support of the settlement by senior counsel for Airservices  the existence of a fair and reasonable settlement distribution scheme  and importantly  the fact that all members of the group of Deacons clients have approved the settlement   I am satisfied that it is appropriate so to approve it citedMultiplex Funds Management v P Dawson Nominees   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe group was thus identified by criteria not limited to those associated with the nature of the claims themselves   Multiplex Funds Management v P Dawson Nominees   FCAFC         FCR   at     per Jacobson J   While I am informed that there are other former employees of Airservices not listed in Attachment   who otherwise come within the description set out in paragraph   of the application  those persons have not signed an agreement with Deacons  Those persons will not be bound by the proposed settlement  Following earlier unsuccessful attempts at settlement  including an attempted mediation  the matter has now been settled between the parties on the basis recorded in a  Deed of Release and Confidentiality  citedTaylor v Telstra Corporation Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA
