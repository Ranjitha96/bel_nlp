Mining and Energy Union   FCA         IR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  On   July   I delivered judgment on liability   A   L Silvestri Pty Ltd v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union   FCA         IR     The findings can be summarised as follows    Lane  CFMEU and CFMEU NSW contravened s  NC of the Workplace Relations Act    Cth   Pre Reform   It is now common ground that no case of such breach was pleaded against CFMEU NSW     Lane  Primmer  Kelly  CFMEU and CFMEU NSW contravened s  D of the Trade Practices Act    Cth      Lane  Primmer  Kelly  CFMEU and CFMEU NSW interfered with the contract between LGB and Silvestri P L   Damages for breach of s  D of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and interfering with the contract and penalties for breach of s  NC must now be determined  It is not necessary to repeat the factual background to the proceeding  save for where it is relevant to the consideration of remedies  Phrases and terms used in these reasons  if otherwise undefined or unexplained  are to be understood by reference to the judgment on liability   The respondents contend that the contract between LGB and Silvestri P L was an hourly hire and that damages should not exceed compensation for more than two hours  work  I disagree  Both parties to the contract understood that the job entailed all of the excavation required at the site  I so held in the judgment on liability   A   L Silvestri Pty Ltd   FCA         IR   at      The benefit of that arrangement was denied by reason of the wrongful actions of the respondents   Silvestri P L s primary claim is for damages based upon the time that was taken to complete the job by other contractors many months  with more than one machine operating at times  I do not accept that approach  The question is the time that Silvestri P L would have taken  Both Antonio Silvestri and Krkovski estimated that the job would take three to four weeks  There was evidence of inefficiency on the part of successive excavation contractors in completing the job and there was a holiday period  Nonetheless  the time actually taken does indicate that the parties were over optimistic in the estimate of three to four weeks  Any such estimate would necessarily depend upon the nature of the material encountered  weather and other factors  I will take eight weeks working at the rate of five days and   hours per week as to length of the job  I allow   per hour to take account of excavator and hammer hire as well as excavator hire  leading to a loss of revenue of   less variable costs of   per day for fuel and oil totalling   leaving a net loss of revenue of    During the eight week period from   October   Silvestri P L earned   for excavator  mini excavator and mini excavator float hire  The amount lost is therefore near enough to   plus interest from   October   to the date of judgment  I cannot see that there is any practical difference as to calculation of damages between the count in tort and the count based upon s  D   A preliminary question arises as to the number of contraventions committed  The applicants submit that each of the  explicit threats  by Lane constituted a separate breach of s  NC by both Lane and the CFMEU and therefore each can and should be the subject of a separate penalty  They seek declarations for  in effect  six contraventions  each relating to an identified event  The respondents submit that the application and the amended statement of claim allege only one contravention of s  NC and seek only the imposition of one penalty in respect of the conduct pleaded  In the alternative  the respondents contend that  if there are separate contraventions by Lane  and through him the CFMEU  then they were part of a single course of conduct to which the totality principle would apply  as in imposing a penalty for a number of offences it is necessary to ensure that the penalties in aggregate are just and appropriate  I accept that only one contravention evidenced by a series of actions is alleged on the pleadings and will proceed accordingly citedKelly v Fitzpatrick   FCA         IR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  A number of authorities discuss the factors to be taken into account in fixing a penalty  many of them borrowing from related fields  including the criminal law  It is sufficient to refer to the recent case of Kelly v Fitzpatrick   FCA         IR   as an example  However  the discretion is at large  There are no mandatory statutory criteria and it is wrong to regard factors seen as relevant by one court as statutory criteria  Indeed  lists of factors can confuse an essentially straightforward task and lead to over elaborate reasoning  The maximum penalty for the Union is   and   for Lane   On any view Lane s contravention must be ranked at the high end of the range  although not as the most serious  His actions were concerted  deliberate and persistent over a period  They affected not only a small business operator in Silvestri P L  but a significant project in the city of Wollongong  This cannot be seen as an isolated incident out of character  Lane presented his demands as part of a campaign to control industrial relations in the building industry in Wollongong  His conduct was belligerent and arrogant  He denied the case against him and fought it all the way  Following judgment he was quoted in an article in the Illawarra Mercury as follows  Mr Lane said the decision was an  absolute outrage    I had no goal whatsoever of extracting an EBA between  Mr Silvestri  and his employees  because there were no employees  he said   In a letter addressed to the Court on   August   Lane stated that he did not recall making the comments as quoted but did not deny making them  He withdrew his comments and apologised to the Court for making them  adding that they were made in haste with insufficient thought  The evidence shows that Lane s apology was the result of a direction by the CFMEU State Secretary  He is not entitled to any discount for genuine contrition as to the events of October     A number of character references were tendered on behalf of Lane  The references show that Lane is well regarded by his peers in the industry  However  some of the references seem to suggest that Lane s conduct was characteristic and justifiable  It may be accepted that Lane is generally of good character  but the relevant issue here is whether he is prepared to abide by the law of the land as to workplace relations and union activity citedRe Election for Office in the Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union  Ex parte Sutton   FCA         IR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  A number of findings involving unlawful behaviour by officials related to the CFMEU have been made in recent years  in addition to the other case involving Lane  eg Construction  Forestry  Mining   Energy Union v Coal   Allied Operations Pty Ltd  No     FCA

    IR    Counsel for the CFMEU submits that only building industry cases are relevant  and then only those that involve the relevant divisional branch  the New South Wales Construction and General Divisional Branch  bearing in mind that the Union is an amalgamated federation   Re Election for Office in the Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union  Ex parte Sutton   FCA         IR   at      I agree that the classes of case identified are the most relevant  but I do not agree that the other cases are irrelevant  Ultimately  union officials will act in accordance with the policies of the union  An official of one geographic or industry branch will observe the manner in which policies are applied by the federal body in relation to other branches  These various cases illustrate that the federal body has not been effective in ensuring that officials act in accordance with the law  I note that there is no evidence of offending officials  including Lane  suffering any serious disciplinary penalties   In my opinion  notwithstanding the purely vicarious nature of the liability of the CFMEU  the penalty in this case  when compared with the maximum penalty  should adequately reflect the systematic nature of the failure of the CFMEU to deter or prevent actions of the kind involved in this case and act as a spur towards effective action by the CFMEU and the State entities connected with it  A penalty of   will be imposed   Declarations as to contravention will be made  The respondents should pay the first applicant damages in the sum of   plus interest from   October   to the date of judgment  The respondent Lane is to pay a penalty of    The respondent CFMEU is to pay a penalty of    The applicants should bring in revised draft minutes of order to give effect to
