four cases in which this interpretation has been applied  These cases are           Essenbourne Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA       ATC       ATR    a decision of Kiefel J     Walstern Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR       ATR    a decision of Hill J     Spotlight Stores Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         ATR     ATC    a decision of Merkel J  and     Caelli Constructions  Vic  Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR       ATR     ATC    a decision of Kenny J    In each of the Federal Court decisions Walstern   Spotlight Stores and Caelli Constructions   the learned judge followed and applied the principles decided by Kiefel J in Essenbourne    Finally  in Caelli Constructions Kenny J assumed that Essenbourne correctly stated the law  and applied the principle to the facts of the case  par     As I have already noted  in Walstern  at FCA par   per Hill J  and Caelli Constructions  at FCA par   per Kenny J  their Honours stated their views that the decision of Kiefel J in Essenbourne was correct  and stated the law  Merkel J in Spotlight Stores did not need to discuss the Essenbourne case in great detail  however his Honour observed that he proposed to follow Essenbourne and Walstern as  notwithstanding the submissions of the Commissioner in Spotlight Stores   his Honour was not satisfied that those decisions were clearly wrong  at FCA par    Hill J in Walstern had also indicated that  as a matter of comity  he would have followed the decision of Kiefel J in Essenbourne unless he had formed the view either it was distinguishable or that the decision was clearly wrong  neither of which was the case  at par     Notwithstanding powerful submissions by the Commissioner  I am not satisfied that the principle articulated by Kiefel J in Essenbourne is clearly wrong  With respect  there is little to add to the reasons provided by Kiefel J in Essenbourne or Hill J in Walstern which have been repeated in this judgment  I agree with the four judges in Essenbourne  Walstern  Spotlight Stores and Caelli Constructions that the identification of particular employees is a requisite element in the application of the definition of  fringe benefit  under the FBTAA   Like the judges in Walstern   Spotlight Stores and Caelli Constructions I propose to follow the Essenbourne decision and  to the extent it is applicable to the facts of the case before me  apply it   On the other hand  the facts of the case before me may be contrasted with those in Walstern and Caelli Constructions   where the Courts found against the respective applicants  In Walstern   Hill J found that a fringe benefit had been provided to each of two employees at the time allocation was made by the trustee of the contribution made by the employer  in circumstances where          the trustee was clearly an  arranger  within the meaning of par  e  of the definition of  fringe benefit  and    the arrangement in question was one which involved the employer making the contribution on the understanding that all relevant steps would be taken culminating in the trustee ultimately allocating the employer s contribution equally to each of the two employees   In Caelli Constructions   Kenny J found that contributions to a trustee had been made  in respect of the employment of the employee  for the purposes of the definition of  fringe benefit  in s   FBTAA in circumstances where          the trust deed required that payments made by the employer and others to the trustee be made in respect of identified employees    the quantum of the payment to be made by the employer was specifically fixed by reference to the actual employment of each employee  in the sense that the employer made a weekly contribution for any week in which an employee was entitled to be paid wages in respect of their work  and if an employee ceased work during a relevant period the amount of the employer s payment was correspondingly reduced    payments in respect of a particular worker were credited towards the individual worker s Worker s Account maintained by the trustee  and    when the employee became entitled to a benefit  the trust deed specified that the amount of benefit was calculated directly by reference to the contribution made to the worker s own Worker s Account at the relevant time   Again  it is clear in this case that the nature of the scheme created both by the trust deed and the arrangement in place in Caelli was such that contributions to the trustee were made in respect of the employment of particular employees  to the extent that weekly contributions were made and varied depending on the circumstances of particular employees  and the fund operated accordingly  In no way were similar circumstances replicated in the case before me   In the alternative  the Commissioner has submitted that the trust in favour of the beneficiaries took immediate effect as a vested interest in equal shares  This issue may be quickly dealt with  In my view the trust in favour of the beneficiaries in the case before me did not take immediate effect as a vested interest in equal shares  The beneficiaries are not implied takers in default  This is evident from consideration of clauses in the CSP Deed including          clause     definition of  Termination Date  namely the earliest to occur of the date a liquidator is appointed to ABC  the date a liquidator is appointed to ABC Public  and the date   years from the date of the Deed  read in conjunction with Clause     which provides that the trustee holds the Trust Fund for the Beneficiaries and must  inter alia  appoint all of the Trust Fund to the Beneficiaries  who must be living at the time of the appointment  on or before the Termination Date    clause     which provides that if the Trust Fund has not been effectively or validly disposed of by a trust declared by the deed  the trustee holds that part of the Trust Fund affected on a resulting trust for the Settlor  ABC Public    clause     which vests the trustee with broad powers to appoint capital  read with clause     which requires the trustee to act reasonably and have regard to the Selection Criteria for Capital in Schedule     clause     which vests the trustee with absolute discretion to exclude any person from benefiting under the deed  The trustee is required to act reasonably and must have regards to the Exclusionary Criteria in Schedule   and    clause     which provides as follows   Every trust  power  authority and discretion of the Trustee   a  is absolute and uncontrolled  and        b  may be exercised in the same way as the Trustee could exercise it if the Trustee were the absolute and beneficial owner of the Trust Fund  citedCTC Resources NL v Commissioner of

html  In the case before me the applicant is asking the Court to confirm an interpretation of the definition of  fringe benefit  which has been previously applied in four cases decided by judges of the Federal Court  and to find that that interpretation is applicable in the case now before me  Further  the applicant is asking the Court to require the Commissioner to rule in accordance with that interpretation  The foundation of this interpretation is in the judgment of Kiefel J in Essenbourne Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA       ATC       ATR   where her Honour held that the definition of  fringe benefit  as defined by subs   Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act    Cth    FBTAA   requires reference to a particular employee in connection with the benefit said to have been provided  In the absence of reference to a particular employee in connection with the benefit  the benefit provided is not a  fringe benefit  for the purposes of the FBTAA    I have referred to four cases in which this interpretation has been applied  These cases are           Essenbourne Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA       ATC       ATR    a decision of Kiefel J     Walstern Pty Ltd v

and subsequently applied  is not correct  He has made submissions to this effect  referring to Australian Taxation Office Media Release Nat    Further  in the Explanation attached to the Private Ruling provided to the applicant  the Commissioner confirmed that his views as expressed in Taxation Ruling   remained the ATO position notwithstanding the decision in Essenbourne   The Commissioner in the case before me is asking the Court to reconsider the interpretation of  fringe benefit  articulated in Essenbourne    This application  and the position taken by the Commissioner  both practically in disallowing the applicant s objection and legally in his submissions  lead in my view to two key questions which require decision by this Court           Should this Court apply the interpretation of  fringe benefit  as applied in Essenbourne   specifically that there will be no fringe benefit unless there is identification of particular employees in connection with the receipt of the benefit     If the Court should apply that interpretation  was a fringe benefit provided within the meaning of s   FBTAA in the case before me  Before going to those questions  it is appropriate to consider the relevant history of this matter  in particular          details of the proposal the subject of the appeal    Question   in the Application for the Private Ruling submitted by the applicant and other rulees    the case of the applicant in submitting that the issue of shares in ABC Learning Centres Ltd  ABC Public  to the trustee of the Carers Share Plan  CSP  did not give rise to a fringe benefit in relation to either ABC Public or the rulee Regional Management Companies  RMCs  and    the reasons of the Commissioner in making a ruling unfavourable to the applicant  which forms the primary focus of this application   The factual background to this application and the arrangement proposed by the applicant are not in dispute in the sense that          the facts were substantially detailed in Appendix   to the Application for Private Ruling submitted by Harris Black Chartered Accountants on   June   on behalf of the list of rulees named in Appendix   to that Application  The applicant in the case before me is one of those rulees  and    those facts were essentially reproduced in the  Outline of the relevant facts  contained in a letter under the hand of Mr Paul Duffus  Deputy Commissioner of Taxation  on   June   containing the Private Ruling produced by the Australian Taxation Office in response to the Application for Private Ruling   So far as is relevant for present purposes  the case of the applicant is as follows          the ABC Public shares were provided by ABC Public to the trustee of the CSP  ABC Public was not an associate of the RMCs whose employees potentially could receive a benefit    the ABC Public shares were provided by the trustee of the CSP to particular employees  The trustee was also not an associate of those RMCs    no employee had any entitlement to ABC Public shares unless and until he or she qualified for appointment  and was appointed those shares by the trustee of the CSP    there was no sufficient or material link between the issue of shares by ABC Public to the trustee of the CSP  and the employment of any employee of an RMC  Instead  the CSP acted as a true incentive to the employees to remain in employment with an RMC because an employee could only benefit if and when the trustee of the CSP exercised its discretion in his or her favour  When the trustee exercised its discretion in an employee s favour  any benefit in the form of dividends or shares would be assessable income to the employee    in order to fall within the definition of  fringe benefit  the relevant benefit must be in respect of the employment of the employee   Essenbourne   In this case  no specific employees were identified as being in receipt of benefits under the proposal  and    the proposal could properly be characterised as falling within the exclusionary principles in par  ha  of the definition of  fringe benefit  in s   FBTAA   namely that it was  a benefit constituted by the acquisition by a person of a share or right under an employee share scheme  within the meaning of Div  A of Pt III of the Income Tax Assessment Act      Such schemes are specifically excluded from being a  fringe benefit  by par  ha  of the definition   Detailed reasons for the answer to Question   were set out in a document entitled  EXPLANATION   This does not form part of the Notice of Private Ruling   This document was attached to the Notice of Private Ruling Authorisation Number   which was in turn sent by letter dated   June   under the hand of Mr Duffus of the Australian Taxation Office to Harris Black Chartered Accountants   In summary  the reasons that the issue of ABC Public shares to the trustee of the CSP were deemed by the Commissioner to give rise to a fringe benefit in relation to the rulee RMCs as employers were as follows          shares are considered to be property and therefore a  benefit  for the purposes of the FBTAA     when ABC Public issued shares to the trustee  ABC Public was considered to provide property to the trustee pursuant to s   FBTAA     the trustee of the CSP was considered to be  an associate  of an employee where the employee was capable of benefiting under the trust  Therefore when ABC Public issued shares to the trustee of a trust and an employee was capable of benefiting under that trust  a benefit would be provided to an associate of the employee    in considering whether one of the ABC entities could be a relevant person for the purposes of either par  e  or par  ea  of the definition of  fringe benefit  there appears to have been some confusion in the Explanation  In the Commissioner s analysis with respect to whether an ABC entity could be  an arranger  for the purposes of par  e  the Commissioner refers to  ABC issu ing  shares to the trustee of a trust  and  ABC intends to issue shares to the trustee for the benefit of the RMCs employees  when the entity actually issuing the shares was ABC Public   In the final analysis  the Commissioner was of the view that it was arguable that the entity issuing shares was not an  arranger  within the meaning of par  e    in relation to the possible operation of par  ea  however  the Commissioner was of the view that ABC would be  a person  the provider  if            o the RMCs participated in or facilitated the issue of shares to the trustee  and knew or ought to have known they were doing so  or  o the RMCs participated in  facilitated or promoted the CSP  and knew or ought to have known they were doing so            The Commissioner stated in the Explanation that if the RMCs were to provide this information to the trustee  they would be participating in or facilitating the issue of shares to the trustee and participating in or facilitating the CSP and would know or ought reasonably to know they were doing so  Where the information was provided to the trustee by ABC  the RMCs are still considered to be participating in or facilitating the issue of shares to the trustee and participating in or facilitating the CSP  because it is only as a result of their agreement with the ABC  under the Licence Agreement  that ABC is able to provide this information    This reasoning was further explained by the Commissioner in the letter of   September   to Harris Black Chartered Accountants  setting out the Reasons for Decision of the Commissioner in finding against the applicant in relation to its Notice of Objection Against Private Ruling  The Commissioner  through Mr Duffus  pointed out in that letter that              ABC also provided information to ABC Public for ABC Public to calculate the gifting of shares to the trustee    ABC only had that information to allow it to prepare the payrolls for the RMCs  and    the only way ABC could lawfully pass on such information to ABC Public was with the participation or facilitation of the RMCs            The Commissioner was of the view that in these circumstances the RMCs would know  or ought reasonably to know  that the RMCs were doing so pursuant to par  ea    Accordingly in the view of the Commissioner it followed that for the purposes of par  ea  of the definition of  fringe benefit  ABC was  a person  the provider    the Commissioner noted that  fringe benefit  in s   FBTAA meant  inter alia   a benefit provided in  respect of the employment of the employee   In his view the CSP operated as an employee incentive scheme providing rewards to RMC employees for services they provided as employees  Accordingly  the issue of shares by ABC Public to the trustee of the CSP was a product or incident of the employment of the RMC employees    the reference in the definition of  fringe benefit  to a benefit being provided to  an employee  meant that a fringe benefit could arise notwithstanding that a benefit provided to a trust might not be provided in respect of a specific employee    in any event  the Commissioner was of the view that the facts in this case were arguably distinguishable from those in Essenbourne   In particular  the Commissioner noted that cl   app   to the Application for Private Ruling stated that the initial issue of ordinary shares by ABC Public would be calculated by reference to the number of employees who had signed an AWA  held positions as set out in that document and had served a certain full time period in that position at an ABC centre  The Commissioner said that therefore  it was arguable that the shares issued to the trustee of the CSP were shares provided in respect of the employment of particular employees   In the Explanation  the Commissioner continued to maintain the views expressed in TR   in preference to the views of Kiefel J in Essenbourne   TR   explains the approach of the Commissioner to circumstances where property is gifted to a trust and an employee who is a beneficiary of that trust is able to benefit from that gift  As explained by par   of TR   the Ruling considers  inter alia   whether a payment by an employer of money  which does not constitute salary or wages or an exempt benefit  to the trustee of a trust or non complying superannuation fund is a fringe benefit  and the value of that benefit  The view was expressed in the Explanation that the Ruling applied to the circumstances of this case  and that further for reasons outlined in pars     of TR   a fringe benefit could arise notwithstanding that a benefit provided to a trust was not provided in respect of a specific employee   Paragraphs     of the Ruling are as follows    The definition of fringe benefit in subsection   is in relation to  an employee   It is considered that there will be a fringe benefit  notwithstanding the payment of the money to the trust is not in respect of a specific employee  Such a construction is the natural consequence of the use of the indefinite article  an   It is sufficient if the benefit is provided in relation to employees generally      Alternatively  where the contribution is not made in respect of a particular employee or employees  the benefit will be provided in relation to each and every employee  as the trust or non complying superannuation fund may be for the benefit of all employee       The foregoing construction of the definition of fringe benefit is supported by the fact that paragraph  hb  specifically exempts from the definition         a benefit constituted by the acquisition by a trust of money or other property where the sole activities of the trust are obtaining shares   in a company   of the employer  and providing those shares    to employees of the employer    emphasis added            Such an exclusion would be otiose if the definition of fringe benefit did not include benefits provided to an associate of the employees in respect of the employees generally      An alternative view relies on the reference to  the employee  in paragraph  b  of the definition of fringe benefit  As outlined above  we do not accept this view   By objection dated   July   the applicant objected to the ruling of the Commissioner in response to Question   of the Ruling Application  As I noted earlier in this judgment  the Commissioner disallowed the objection in a letter of   September   containing the Notice of Decision on Objection   An Application was then filed with this Court whereby the applicant appealed against the appealable objection decision   In answering this question  it is helpful to consider          relevant legislative provisions under the FBTAA     the decisions and reasoning in Essenbourne and subsequent cases  and    principles of precedent   Whether the trustee in this case is an associate of the employees within the meaning of the legislation will be considered later in this judgment    The Cases     Essenbourne  As I have already noted  the first issue involves consideration of  fringe benefit  as decided in Essenbourne   It is useful therefore to consider the case and the principle articulated by Kiefel J  currently in dispute   In Essenbourne   the employer was a family company which owned a motor dealership in Queensland  The three key employees were three sons of the Marino family  which controlled Essenbourne Pty Ltd  The sons received low salaries in keeping with the corporate strategy of coping with periods of business downturn  and enabling surplus funds to be re invested in profitable years  In light of the low salaries  a superannuation fund  an employee share fund and an employee incentive trust were established to provide benefits primarily to the three employees of Essenbourne Pty Ltd who were family members  This was in addition to the salaries they received  and in order to retain their services   Various capital contributions were made to each entity  however the critical payment for present purposes was a contribution by Essenbourne Pty Ltd of     to the employer incentive trust on   June    This sum was calculated on the advice of the solicitor of Essenbourne Pty Ltd  and was equivalent to the sum which could be contributed to the superannuation fund on the basis of the age of all members of the superannuation fund  On the same day  the three key employees were allotted each one third of the Employee Units in the trust  ie   units each  The employees were not required to pay for those units   The Trust Deed of the employee incentive trust provided that the Trust was to provide benefits and incentives to employees  and that the employer  Essenbourne Pty Ltd  was to make contributions for the benefit of  its employees generally   cl      Further  the Deed allowed the trustee to issue Bonus Units in respect of Employee Units to the holders of those units on such basis as the trustee  with the consent of the employee  might determine  cl       As Kiefel J noted  the Commissioner had not suggested the three brothers  employees of Essenbourne Pty Ltd  were entitled to the trust money or the property in which the money was invested  Her Honour also observed that under the Trust  the brothers had only the prospect of Bonus Units issuing  par     While Kiefel J accepted the Commissioner s proposition that it was not necessary that an employee be in receipt of a benefit where it has been provided to an associate of that employee  the fact of provision of a benefit to an associate is not enough in itself to make that benefit a  fringe benefit  within the meaning of the FBTAA   As her Honour pointed out   The difficulty in the Commissioner s approach is that it does not identify a benefit to a particular employee  The statute may deem a benefit to be provided to an employee where it is provided to the employee s trustee  but this would not obviate the apparent necessity to identify the employee in question  The definition of  fringe benefit  would appear to require the identification of the employee to whom the benefit is provided  This is the principal contention of Essenbourne    par    emphasis added  Her Honour agreed with the contention of Essenbourne Pty Ltd that the definition of  fringe benefit  required reference to a particular employee in connection with the benefit said to be provided  This requirement of the definition was not  in Kiefel J s view  satisfied in Essenbourne   Given the nature of the contest before me  it is important and relevant to set out her Honour s reasoning on this point    In my view Essenbourne is correct in its contention that the definition of  fringe benefit  requires reference to a particular employee in connexion with the benefit said to have been provided  This is reflected in the references to a benefit being  provided to the employee or to an associate of the employee  and to the benefit being provided  in respect of the employment of the employee   emphasis added   The latter reference  in particular  can only be to a particular person s employment  The Commissioner submitted that the reference to  an employee  in the definition should be read as  employees  in the case of certain benefits  as s   Acts Interpretation Act    Cth  would permit  In my view the Assessment Act requires that the particular employee be identified in connexion with the benefit  It is their employment which  after all  provides the necessary  link  to the benefit  see J   G Knowles   Associates Pty Ltd v FC of T   FCA         FCR    The definition does not admit of a reference to a number of employees in connexion with the benefit  the subject of the assessment           The link between the benefit and the employment of the employee is required to be sufficient or material  J   G Knowles       It arises because of the words  in respect of the employment   A mere causal link with the employment of the employee will not be sufficient  Essenbourne submits that  at least until the issue of Bonus Units  there is not a sufficient connexion with the brothers  employment  It seems to me that the substantial link at this point is as between the payment and the deduction sought by Essenbourne  It is not necessary for me to further consider the point for  in my view  the payment by Essenbourne to the trustee does not qualify as a fringe benefit as it is defined   Accordingly  on the facts of the case  Kiefel J held that the benefits provided were not  fringe benefits     Walstern  Spotlight Stores and Caelli Constructions  In each of the Federal Court decisions Walstern   Spotlight Stores and Caelli Constructions   the learned judge followed and applied the principles decided by Kiefel J in Essenbourne    In Walstern   Hill J decisively and unambiguously agreed with Kiefel J in Essenbourne on this issue  His Honour said   at   As I have already noted  I would  as a matter of comity  follow the decision of Kiefel J in Essenbourne unless the case was either distinguishable or I was of the view that the decision was clearly wrong  On this point the case is not distinguishable  Further  far from being of the view that her Honour was clearly wrong  I am of the view that her Honour was clearly right  The definition of  fringe benefit  in s   of the FBTA Act makes clear the importance of identification of the employee  The benefit itself is one which is said to be  in relation to an employee   The benefit is required to have been provided to the employee  or associate of the employee  and is required to be in respect of the employment of the employee  The definition of  property fringe benefit   if that is the kind of benefit relied upon  requires relevantly provision of property to a particular person there referred to as  the recipient   The valuation formula relevantly here requires that there be a benefit provided  to a person  in respect of the employment of an employee  Any contribution made by an individual employee is taken into account in determining the taxable value of the benefit  Although not relevant in the present case  the exclusion of a benefit otherwise deductible to an employee contemplates taking into account the specific circumstances of the employee himself or herself    It is not surprising that the legislation requires a link between the benefit and a particular employee  or associate of a particular employee  because historically the purpose of the Fringe Benefits Tax Act    Cth  is to provide a specific means of taxing benefits which are a substitute for income to an employee and in respect of which the provisions of the   Act and particular s  e  were thought to be defective  Income tax is a tax upon the taxable income of a particular employee  While fringe benefits tax is a tax for which an employer is made liable and is payable at the maximum personal income tax rate  the theory of fringe benefits tax legislation is that it operates as a final withholding tax payable by the employer on amounts that essentially are or would be income of the employee     Finally  in Caelli Constructions Kenny J assumed that Essenbourne correctly stated the law  and applied the principle to the facts of the case  par     As I have already noted  in Walstern  at FCA par   per Hill J  and Caelli Constructions  at FCA par   per Kenny J  their Honours stated their views that the decision of Kiefel J in Essenbourne was correct  and stated the law  Merkel J in Spotlight Stores did not need to discuss the Essenbourne case in great detail  however his Honour observed that he proposed to follow Essenbourne and Walstern as  notwithstanding the submissions of the Commissioner in Spotlight Stores   his Honour was not satisfied that those decisions were clearly wrong  at FCA par    Hill J in Walstern had also indicated that  as a matter of comity  he would have followed the decision of Kiefel J in Essenbourne unless he had formed the view either it was distinguishable or that the decision was clearly wrong  neither of which was the case  at par     Accordingly  in my view it would be appropriate to follow the principle articulated in Essenbourne and followed by three other judges of the Federal Court before me  unless in my view the principle is clearly wrong  or the facts before me are distinguishable   Notwithstanding powerful submissions by the Commissioner  I am not satisfied that the principle articulated by Kiefel J in Essenbourne is clearly wrong  With respect  there is little to add to the reasons provided by Kiefel J in Essenbourne or Hill J in Walstern which have been repeated in this judgment  I agree with the four judges in Essenbourne  Walstern  Spotlight Stores and Caelli Constructions that the identification of particular employees is a requisite element in the application of the definition of  fringe benefit  under the FBTAA   Like the judges in Walstern   Spotlight Stores and Caelli Constructions I propose to follow the Essenbourne decision and  to the extent it is applicable to the facts of the case before me  apply it   As I take the view that I should apply the interpretation of  fringe benefit  as applied in Essenbourne   it is necessary to consider whether the facts of the case before me are distinguishable in such a fashion that the principle is not applicable  So far as is relevant in the context of this case  the question is whether the ABC Public shares  which are the benefits in question  have been provided in respect of the employment of a particular employee or employees    If  as the applicant contends  the employees are not identified with sufficient particularity  in my view the question of the benefit being  in respect of  their employment does not arise  As Kiefel J pointed out in Essenbourne    It is their employment which  after all  provides the necessary  link  to the benefit  see J   G Knowles   Associates Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR     The Commissioner has submitted that the facts of this case are distinguishable from those in Essenbourne   and that if it was necessary to establish that the provision of benefits was in respect of particular employees  this was the case  The Commissioner has submitted in summary          beneficiaries were identifiable precisely from the terms of the CSP Deed  in particular clause     which states   Beneficiary  means  at any time  any employee of an Employer RMC who         a  is registered as a party to an Australian Workplace Agreement with an Employer RMC  and  b  holds the position of assistant  group leader  director or regional manager with an Employer RMC   other than an Excluded Person         the employment plainly is the explanation for the provision of the benefit in the form of the ABC Public shares in respect of employees who are beneficiaries under the CSP Deed this was clearly described in the application for the private ruling    the selection criteria are incorporated into the terms of the CSP Deed  and the CSP Deed requires the trustee to have regard to those criteria in exercising its power of appointment    the benefit is provided by ABC Public as  the arranger  within the meaning of par  e  of the definition of  fringe benefit  in s   FBTAA   The Commissioner submits that  arrangement  is defined in very broad terms by s   FBTAA   and the context for the proposed plan as outlined in the ruling application evidences that the issue of the shares is made under an  arrangement  between ABC Public and the relevant RMCs  notwithstanding the particular facts relied on by the applicant  and    in the alternative  the benefit is provided by ABC Public within the meaning of subpara  ea  on the basis that there is participation and or facilitation by the RMCs in the provision of the share issue to their employees  and knowledge by the RMCs  or they ought reasonably to know  that they are doing so   In my view the issue of whether a benefit has been provided by ABC Public as  the arranger  within subpara  e  of the definition of  fringe benefit  in s   FBTAA   or provided by ABC Public within the meaning of subpara  ea  of that definition  does not arise  because in my view the benefits provided in this case were not  in respect of the employment of the employee     It is instructive to compare the proposal before me  the rights of the employees who are potential beneficiaries under the CSP Deed  and the extent to which they are identified  with the facts in Essenbourne   Indeed  the interpretation of  fringe benefit  articulated by Kiefel J in Essenbourne appears even more relevant to the facts in this case before me than it was in Essenbourne   In my view the applicant s case before me is stronger than it was before her Honour   Relevant aspects of the arrangement in this case include          the benefits in question  namely the shares in ABC Public  were provided by ABC Public  which  notwithstanding that was the holding company of the statutory licensee  was not in any relationship with the employees who would receive the shares which are alleged to constitute the fringe benefit  The provider of the benefits was therefore more remote from the employees than was the case in Essenbourne   where the entity which contributed some of the capital to the fund was the employer of potential beneficiaries    the trustee of the CSP under the CSP Deed was an independent professional trustee  This can be compared with  for example  the trustee in Essenbourne where the trustee was a corporate entity of which potential beneficiaries were directors    in the case before me the potential beneficiaries were defined in the CSP Deed as RMC employees who satisfied various criteria  The relationship between the provider of the shares  ABC Public  the regional managers and the RMCs was within the framework of a franchise structure  Importantly  any future employees of existing RMCs  or of future RMCs which later came into existence and entered an arrangement with ABC Public  could also potentially qualify as beneficiaries of the CSP  The arrangement in this case did not involve potential provision for family members associated with the employer company as was the case in Essenbourne     the CSP was a discretionary trust   with the trustee vested with powers to appoint income and capital of the trust fund among the beneficiaries on such terms and in such proportions as it saw fit  This is clear from cl     and cl     of the CSP Deed  Although the trustee was required by cl     and cl     of the CSP Deed to act reasonably and to have regard to the selection criteria provided in the CSP Deed  in my view this did not override the discretionary powers of the trustee  The position of the trustee was reinforced by cl     of the CSP Deed  which provided that every trust  power  authority and discretion of the trustee was absolute and uncontrolled   This was similar to Essenbourne where the Trust Deed provided for the employer to make contributions for the benefit of  its employees generally  and employees were entitled to subscribe for Employee Units  however distributions of income to employee unit holders was determined from time to time by the trustee  Further  in Essenbourne employees were not entitled to receive Bonus Units unless certain conditions had been satisfied including periods of time as full time employees of Essenbourne Pty Ltd    although the calculation of the initial issue of shares by ABC Public to the trustee of the CSP may have been by reference to the total number of employees of the applicant and the other RMCs at that time              clearly no immediate benefit could be provided in respect of future employees of the RMCs  who were nonetheless future potential beneficiaries    the identification by the trustee of employees who satisfied the selection criteria to the extent that the trustee was required to distribute trust property to those employees  as already discussed was an event to take place after initial issue  which meant that at the time the contribution was to be made to the trustee no identified RMC employees were beneficiaries of the CSP    it is also feasible that additional RMC employees could become parties to new AWAs without further shares necessarily being issued by ABC Public to the trustee  and    on the facts it would also be possible for shares to be issued to the trustee in batches for employees generally  without reference to particular employees   As counsel for the applicant submitted  a far stronger connection existed between the contributions made for the employees and each employee s employment in Essenbourne   than existed between the proposed share issue by ABC Public and any particular RMC employee s employment   The applicant has also submitted that the Commissioner was wrong to decide that he was not bound by previous decisions of the Federal Court following and including Essenbourne   On the facts of the case before me  it is unnecessary for me to consider this issue    THE COURT ORDERS THAT         The appeal against the appealable objection decision made by the Commissioner of Taxation under s  ZY of the Taxation Administration Act    Cth  to disallow in full the applicant s taxation objection against the private ruling issued to the applicant for the FBT years ended   March   to   March   be allowed      The Commissioner s decision be set aside  and substituted with the decision that the applicant s taxation objection be allowed in full      The objection decision should have been as follows        a  the correct response to Question   of the ruling application is that the proposed issue of shares by ABC Learning Centres Limited to the trustee of the Carers Share Plan will not give rise to a fringe benefit in relation to the rulee RMCs  including the applicant  and  b  the ruling should be amended accordingly

htmlcitedGartside v Inland Revenue Commissioners   UKHL       AC   The nature of a discretionary trust is such that  although the beneficiaries have an interest in the trust  it is in the nature of a right to be considered as a potential recipient of benefit by the trustees  and a right to have their interests protected by a court of equity  Gartside v Inland Revenue Commissioners   UKHL       AC   at    As Lord Wilberforce said in Gartside    W hen it is said that he has a right to have the trustees exercise their discretion  fairly  or  reasonably  or properly that indicates clearly enough

Question   namely   If the Court should apply that interpretation  was a fringe benefit provided within the meaning of s   FBTAA in the case before me     the answer is that no fringe benefit was

html  In Hicks v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at   French J said   The injunction to judicial comity does not merely advance mutual politeness as between judges of the same or co ordinate jurisdictions  It tends also to uphold the authority of the courts and confidence in the law by the value it places upon consistency in judicial decision making and mutual respect between judges  And where questions of law  and statutory construction  are concerned the proposition that a judge who has taken one view of the law or a statute is  clearly wrong  is one not lightly to be advanced having regard to the choices that so often confront the courts particularly in the area of statutory construction  Indeed  where a serious doubt arises on the part of one judge  about the correctness of the law as stated by another  in a matter of importance  it may be desirable for a case to be stated to the Full Court for early resolution of the question in

Her Honour agreed with the contention of Essenbourne Pty Ltd that the definition of  fringe benefit  required reference to a particular employee in connection with the benefit said to be provided  This requirement of the definition was not  in Kiefel J s view  satisfied in Essenbourne   Given the nature of the contest before me  it is important and relevant to set out her Honour s reasoning on this point    In my view Essenbourne is correct in its contention that the definition of  fringe benefit  requires reference to a particular employee in connexion with the benefit said to have been provided  This is reflected in the references to a benefit being  provided to the employee or to an associate of the employee  and to the benefit being provided  in respect of the employment of the employee   emphasis added   The latter reference  in particular  can only be to a particular person s employment  The Commissioner submitted that the reference to  an employee  in the definition should be read as  employees  in the case of certain benefits  as s   Acts Interpretation Act    Cth  would permit  In my view the Assessment Act requires that the particular employee be identified in connexion with the benefit  It is their employment which  after all  provides the necessary  link  to the benefit  see J   G Knowles   Associates Pty Ltd v FC of T   FCA         FCR    The definition does not admit of a reference to a number of employees in connexion with the benefit  the subject of the assessment           The link between the benefit and the employment of the employee is required to be sufficient or material  J   G Knowles       It arises because of the words  in respect of the employment   A mere causal link with the employment of the employee will not be sufficient  Essenbourne submits that  at least until the issue of Bonus Units  there is not a sufficient connexion with the brothers  employment  It seems to me that the substantial link at this point is as between the payment and the deduction sought by Essenbourne  It is not necessary for me to further consider the point for  in my view  the payment by Essenbourne to the trustee does not qualify as a fringe benefit as it is defined   The words  in respect of the employment  in the context of the definition of  fringe benefit  were explained by the Full Court of the Federal Court in J   G Knowles and Associates Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR    Their Honours pointed out that what needs to be established is whether there is a sufficient or material causal connection or relationship between the benefit and the employment  Considering in individual circumstances whether the benefit is a product or incident of the employment is useful if it is not  then the benefit is likely to be extraneous to the employment and not bear fringe benefits tax  notwithstanding that the employment might have been a causal factor  at     In the case before me there is clearly some connection between a beneficiary of the CSP receiving the ABC Public shares  and a beneficiary being an employee of an RMC who has satisfied nominated criteria  Further  on the facts of this case the trustee of the CSP appears to be an associate of the employees as defined by s   FBTAA   Accordingly  the question in the case before me becomes   a  whether employees are identified with sufficient particularity to come within the definition of  fringe benefit  in s   FBTAA   and if so   b  whether there is a sufficient or material causal connection or relationship between the benefit and the employment of the employees to satisfy the definition of  fringe benefit  in s   FBTAA    If  as the applicant contends  the employees are not identified with sufficient particularity  in my view the question of the benefit being  in respect of  their employment does not arise  As Kiefel J pointed out in Essenbourne    It is their employment which  after all  provides the necessary  link  to the

followedSpotlight Stores Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         ATR     ATC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  I have referred to four cases in which this interpretation has been applied  These cases are           Essenbourne Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA       ATC       ATR    a decision of Kiefel J     Walstern Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR       ATR    a decision of Hill J     Spotlight Stores Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         ATR     ATC    a decision of Merkel J  and     Caelli Constructions  Vic  Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR       ATR     ATC    a decision of Kenny J    In each of the Federal Court decisions Walstern   Spotlight Stores and Caelli Constructions   the learned judge followed and applied the principles decided by Kiefel J in Essenbourne    Similarly  in Spotlight Stores   Merkel J agreed with Kiefel J  His Honour said    In Essenbourne   Kiefel J concluded that the definition requires that for the benefit to be provided in respect of the employment of  the employee  a  particular employee  must be able to be identified in connection with the benefit  In Walstern   Hill J agreed with Kiefel J s view  In the present case  it is clear that when the benefit  that is  the   million contribution  was provided it was not provided  whether to  the employee  or to Spotlight Incentive as an  associate  of  the employee  in respect of the employment of any particular employee because the employees of Spotlight were not beneficiaries of the Incentive Trust at that time  The Commissioner contended that I should not follow Essenbourne or Walstern but I am not satisfied those decisions are clearly wrong and  accordingly  propose to follow them  It must follow that Spotlight is entitled to succeed in its appeal in relation to its FBT objection   As I have already noted  in Walstern  at FCA par   per Hill J  and Caelli Constructions  at FCA par   per Kenny J  their Honours stated their views that the decision of Kiefel J in Essenbourne was correct  and stated the law  Merkel J in Spotlight Stores did not need to discuss the Essenbourne case in great detail  however his Honour observed that he proposed to follow Essenbourne and Walstern as  notwithstanding the submissions of the Commissioner in Spotlight Stores   his Honour was not satisfied that those decisions were clearly wrong  at FCA par    Hill J in Walstern had also indicated that  as a matter of comity  he would have followed the decision of Kiefel J in Essenbourne unless he had formed the view either it was distinguishable or that the decision was clearly wrong  neither of which was the case  at par     Notwithstanding powerful submissions by the Commissioner  I am not satisfied that the principle articulated by Kiefel J in Essenbourne is clearly wrong  With respect  there is little to add to the reasons provided by Kiefel J in Essenbourne or Hill J in Walstern which have been repeated in this judgment  I agree with the four judges in Essenbourne  Walstern  Spotlight Stores and Caelli Constructions that the identification of particular employees is a requisite element in the application of the definition of  fringe benefit  under the FBTAA   Like the judges in Walstern   Spotlight Stores and Caelli Constructions I propose to follow the Essenbourne decision and  to the extent it is applicable to the facts of the case before me  apply it   The circumstances before me are in some ways comparable with those in Spotlight Stores   There Merkel J found that when the   million contribution which was the benefit was provided  it was not provided  either to the employee or to the trustee as an associate of the employee  in respect of the employment of any particular employee because the employees of Spotlight were not beneficiaries of the Incentive Trust at that time  Although the fringe benefits tax assessment issue did not require full exploration by his Honour  relevant facts in that case were          the employer contributed sums to a fund established to reward employees    the frequency and amount of the contributions would be determined by the employer in its absolute discretion    a separate trustee was incorporated  the directors of which were also directors of the employer    the discretion of the trustee was absolute and uncontrolled  although in making determinations as to amounts to be paid as benefits  it was required to consult with the employer  and it could have regard to the criteria in clause   of the trust deed  and    beneficiaries were defined as  persons who immediately prior to the date on which an amount is proposed to be paid by the Trustee   has been or is an Employee of  Spotlight  and  in the opinion of the Trustee  fulfils the criteria set out in Clause    Clause   criteria included the contribution made by the beneficiary to the revenues or profits of the employer and the

Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR       ATR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  I have referred to four cases in which this interpretation has been applied  These cases are           Essenbourne Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA       ATC       ATR    a decision of Kiefel J     Walstern Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR       ATR    a decision of Hill J     Spotlight Stores Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         ATR     ATC    a decision of Merkel J  and     Caelli Constructions  Vic  Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR       ATR     ATC    a decision of Kenny J    In each of the Federal Court decisions Walstern   Spotlight Stores and Caelli Constructions   the learned judge followed and applied the principles decided by Kiefel J in Essenbourne    In Walstern   Hill J decisively and unambiguously agreed with Kiefel J in Essenbourne on this issue  His Honour said   at   As I have already noted  I would  as a matter of comity  follow the decision of Kiefel J in Essenbourne unless the case was either distinguishable or I was of the view that the decision was clearly wrong  On this point the case is not distinguishable  Further  far from being of the view that her Honour was clearly wrong  I am of the view that her Honour was clearly right  The definition of  fringe benefit  in s   of the FBTA Act makes clear the importance of identification of the employee  The benefit itself is one which is said to be  in relation to an employee   The benefit is required to have been provided to the employee  or associate of the employee  and is required to be in respect of the employment of the employee  The definition of  property fringe benefit   if that is the kind of benefit relied upon  requires relevantly provision of property to a particular person there referred to as  the recipient   The valuation formula relevantly here requires that there be a benefit provided  to a person  in respect of the employment of an employee  Any contribution made by an individual employee is taken into account in determining the taxable value of the benefit  Although not relevant in the present case  the exclusion of a benefit otherwise deductible to an employee contemplates taking into account the specific circumstances of the employee himself or herself    It is not surprising that the legislation requires a link between the benefit and a particular employee  or associate of a particular employee  because historically the purpose of the Fringe Benefits Tax Act    Cth  is to provide a specific means of taxing benefits which are a substitute for income to an employee and in respect of which the provisions of the   Act and particular s  e  were thought to be defective  Income tax is a tax upon the taxable income of a particular employee  While fringe benefits tax is a tax for which an employer is made liable and is payable at the maximum personal income tax rate  the theory of fringe benefits tax legislation is that it operates as a final withholding tax payable by the employer on amounts that essentially are or would be income of the employee     As I have already noted  in Walstern  at FCA par   per Hill J  and Caelli Constructions  at FCA par   per Kenny J  their Honours stated their views that the decision of Kiefel J in Essenbourne was correct  and stated the law  Merkel J in Spotlight Stores did not need to discuss the Essenbourne case in great detail  however his Honour observed that he proposed to follow Essenbourne and Walstern as  notwithstanding the submissions of the Commissioner in Spotlight Stores   his Honour was not satisfied that those decisions were clearly wrong  at FCA par    Hill J in Walstern had also indicated that  as a matter of comity  he would have followed the decision of Kiefel J in Essenbourne unless he had formed the view either it was distinguishable or that the decision was clearly wrong  neither of which was the case  at par     Notwithstanding powerful submissions by the Commissioner  I am not satisfied that the principle articulated by Kiefel J in Essenbourne is clearly wrong  With respect  there is little to add to the reasons provided by Kiefel J in Essenbourne or Hill J in Walstern which have been repeated in this judgment  I agree with the four judges in Essenbourne  Walstern  Spotlight Stores and Caelli Constructions that the identification of particular employees is a requisite element in the application of the definition of  fringe benefit  under the FBTAA   Like the judges in Walstern   Spotlight Stores and Caelli Constructions I propose to follow the Essenbourne decision and  to the extent it is applicable to the facts of the case before me  apply it   On the other hand  the facts of the case before me may be contrasted with those in Walstern and Caelli Constructions   where the Courts found against the respective applicants  In Walstern   Hill J found that a fringe benefit had been provided to each of two employees at the time allocation was made by the trustee of the contribution made by the employer  in circumstances where          the trustee was clearly an  arranger  within the meaning of par  e  of the definition of  fringe benefit  and    the arrangement in question was one which involved the employer making the contribution on the understanding that all relevant steps would be taken culminating in the trustee ultimately allocating the employer s contribution equally to each of the two employees   In this respect  as his Honour noted  the two employees who were the beneficiaries under the trust in Walstern were clearly identified by the arrangement in place  The arrangement was for their benefit  This may be contrasted with the circumstances in the case before me  where  despite guidelines provided in the CSP Deed  several steps involving satisfaction of criteria and the exercise by the trustee of its discretion required completion  before a selection of potential beneficiaries could be made from the large group of existing  and future  employees of the RMCs citedZotovic v Dobel Boat Hire Pty Ltd     ACTR   In my view  there is little to add to the observations of his Honour in Hicks   Similar observations have been made in many other Federal Court cases including La Macchia v Minister for Primary Industries and Energy     ALR   at    per Burchett J  Bank of Western Australia v Federal Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   at    per Lindgren J  Nezovic v MIMIA   FCA         FCR   at    per French J  and Koara
