Shao v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA     January  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedUddin v Minister for Immigration   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  On   August   the delegate made an entry in the applicant s file    August   reversed cancelled Uddin v MIMIA   The respondent s solicitor has deposed that the respondent accepted the correctness of a decision of Scarlett FM in Uddin v Minister for Immigration   FMCA     Uddin     On   June   Scarlett FM had held in identical factual circumstances that a notice given purportedly pursuant to s   of the ESOS Act  did not comply with s   of that Act  Uddin   The Federal Magistrate held that because s   of the ESOS Act had not been complied with  s  J of the Migration Act was not invoked and therefore the applicant s visa was not cancelled by operation of that section   The notice given in Uddin was in the same form as the notice given in this matter  It did not advise the applicant that he was required to attend in person before an officer within the meaning of the Migration Act but  instead  advised him that he had to report personally to a compliance officer  It did not set out the effect of s  J and s  K of the Migration Act in that it did not inform the applicant that the applicant could avoid the consequences of s  J by making himself available to an officer for the purpose of explaining the breach alleged in the notice  The notice did not bring to the applicant s attention the provisions of s  K  and  in particular  advise the applicant that because of the provisions s   an applicant cannot apply for revocation when the visa would no longer have been in effect in any event had the visa not been cancelled under s  J  Lastly  it did not bring to the applicant s attention the provisions of s   so as to allow the applicant to understand the provisions of s  K    Scarlett FM found that s   of the ESOS Act was mandatory in its terms  The notice did not comply strictly with the requirements in s   of the ESOS Act and  as I understand his reasons  s  J  of the Migration Act therefore was not invoked and the Student visa was therefore never cancelled   The Federal Magistrate made two declarations        That the Applicant s student visa was not cancelled by operation of law under section  J of the Migration Act              That the Applicant was not an unlawful non citizen at any stage      He ordered that the constitutional writs issue to give effect to those declarations   After Scarlett FM s decision  the Department identified visas which were purportedly cancelled pursuant to s  J of the Migration Act where the purported cancellation was affected by the same error as identified in Uddin   The applicant was one of those visa holders   On   August   the same delegate notified the applicant of an intention to consider cancelling the applicant s visa under s   of the Migration Act notwithstanding that the delegate had previously assumed that the visa had already been cancelled by operation of s  J of the Migration Act on   July     Section   of the Migration Act empowers the Minister to cancel a visa if the Minister is satisfied that any of the circumstances in s   have occurred  If the Minister is satisfied that the holder has not complied with a condition of a visa  the Minister may cancel a visa  s  b  of the Migration Act   In the notice given the applicant by the delegate  the delegate identified the ground for cancelling the applicant s visa as being a  possible breach of condition  b  for failing to achieve satisfactory academic results in school years   and   and  Education Provider has reported visa holder as failing   courses out of   during   and     Both parties have asked me to assume that Uddin was correctly decided  I think that assumption can be made because if Uddin was incorrectly decided then the applicant s visa was cancelled by operation of s  J on   July   and that would be an end to the matter  To assume that Uddin was correctly decided is to make an assumption most favourable to the applicant  Therefore I will assume that Uddin was correctly decided   It is necessary to determine the effect of the decision in Uddin   Uddin stands for the proposition that unless the notice given by the registered provider under s   of the ESOS Act complies strictly with subsection    or at least paragraphs  b  and  d  of that subsection  the notice given is not a notice under s   of the ESOS Act and the automatic cancellation provisions of s  J never apply  That is clear from the Federal Magistrate s reasons but made even clearer by the declarations which the Federal Magistrate made  The first declaration is that the applicant s visa was not cancelled by operation of law under s  J  The second declaration  which is consistent with the first  is that the applicant was not an unlawful citizen at any stage   If Uddin was correctly decided and the effect of the decision is as I have described it  then the applicant s argument fails at its first premise  The applicant s visa was never cancelled by operation of s  J and it did not cease to have effect  It follows that the applicant was the holder of a visa as at   August   and the delegate was empowered to cancel that visa   I pointed out in argument that if Uddin is correct then the applicant s visa was not cancelled by operation of s  J and  therefore  there was a valid visa in existence at the time the Minister s delegate made his decision on   August     The applicant s counsel argued  contrary to the decision in Uddin   that because the Migration Act provides for a procedure to review the cancellation  s  K  and revoke that cancellation  s  L and s  N    and because that decision is itself subject to a merits review by the MRT  s  A   in the context of the Act   the automatic cancellation is valid unless and until it is revoked by an administrative decision maker under s  L   or otherwise subject to orders by a court of competent jurisdiction    There are difficulties with that argument  First  it is contrary to the decision in Uddin which I have been asked to assume is correct  Secondly  and more importantly  the argument is contrary to the provisions of the Migration Act   Section  J applies if a notice is sent to a non citizen under s   of the ESOS Act   Uddin   and the applicant s argument  assumes that no notice has been sent under s   of the ESOS Act   Therefore  it must follow that s  J does not apply  Therefore  if no notice is sent to a non citizen under s   of the ESOS Act   the non citizen s visa is never cancelled under s  J of the Migration Act   There can be no automatic cancellation  That is because the condition precedent for the operation of s  J  has not been satisfied  No notice was given under s   of the ESOS Act    It is true that the Migration Act allows for an applicant to apply to the Minister for revocation of the cancellation  s  K of the Migration Act   However  the Minister may on such an application only revoke the cancellation for the reasons in s  L   The Minister cannot revoke the cancellation because no notice was given under s   of the ESOS Act   Of course  one would not think that would be a reason for revocation of cancellation  If no notice is given  there could be no cancellation   That procedure and the fact that that process is subject to merits review by the MRT does not support the proposition that where no notice is given under s   of the ESOS Act the visa holder s visa is automatically cancelled under s  J and remains cancelled until revoked by an administrative decision maker or a court of competent jurisdiction   There is nothing  in my opinion  in the Act or in Uddin which would support the applicant s contention that any administrative decision of any kind is made when s  J applies by reason of a notice having been given under s   of the ESOS Act to a non citizen  There is no administrative decision to be made  Section  J  operates to cancel the non citizen s visa  The only decisions which have to be made relate to the Minister s power to revoke the cancellation effected by s  J    Section  K allow a non citizen  where visa has been cancelled under s  J   to apply to the Minister for revocation of the cancellation  That section also recognises that the cancellation is effected by s  J not by any administrative decision  The Minister may revoke the cancellation for any of the reasons in s  L  of the Migration Act   The Minister may also revoke cancellation on her or his own initiative  s  N of the Migration Act   If the Minister does revoke the cancellation under s  L or s  N  the visa is taken never to have been cancelled under section  J   s  P  of the Migration Act    The whole scheme of this subdivision of the Migration Act is to provide for a statutory form of cancellation of visas which does not require any administrative decision  The scheme is designed to avoid the requirement for any administrative decision and thereby any review of that decision  The Minister s decision making only extends to considering whether the statutory cancellation should be revoked   It follows that the applicant s visa was either cancelled or not cancelled on   July   depending upon whether s  J operated  No administrative decision was made on or after that date to cancel the applicant s visas  It follows that because there was no decision the question of whether it was void or voidable does not arise   For those reasons  that further argument must be rejected   For the reasons I have given it follows that if  contrary to Uddin   s  J operated to cancel the applicant s visa then the applicant has become an unlawful non citizen  On the other hand  if Uddin is correctly decided  then the applicant was the holder of a visa as at   August   when that visa was cancelled pursuant to s   of the Migration Act   Either way the applicant s visa has been cancelled and she has become an unlawful non citizen   It follows that the application must be dismissed   I certify that the preceding sixty
