cth HCA  html  Section  K  it is contended  must be read subject to the objects of Pt XA contained in s  A and particularly s  F which has the effect of importing into s  K a central notion of discrimination against a person or relevantly identified class of persons as compared with others  Since the termination was ubiquitous  there was no threshold of discrimination or differential treatment  Accordingly  the statutory presumption has no role to play in the circumstances of this case  The Employment Advocate must discharge an onus of establishing the colour of the  ingredients   to use a term adopted by Dixon J in another context in The King v Hush  Ex parte Devanny   HCA         CLR   at p   of s  K which involves establishing facts which would support an hypothesis that the conduct occurred for a reason or reasons falling within s  L and only then could the presumption contained in s  V arise or have a role to play   The notion that the Employment Advocate might prove the conduct and simply allege a reason or reasons falling within s  L and then stand on the presumption as a proper discharge of the onus of proof fails  it is said  to understand the proper role of s  V of the Act   In relation to the second contravention based upon the alleged refusal to employ   of the   individuals  the respondents say that as to Blackadder  his employment was continued notwithstanding the alleged dismissal  As to Brooks  Campbell  Delaforce  Forrest  M R McKenzie  P F McKenzie  Moss and J K Young  the respondents say that each of those former employees was offered re employment and in some cases the offers of re employment were taken up and in other cases refused  In the case of Hambly  the respondents say that he was not offered further work after the termination  for reasons related to his work performance and conduct  As to Swain  the respondents plead that he contacted the abattoir by letter dated   September   and again on or about   January   and was advised that no work was then available  Accordingly  the respondents deny a refusal to employ   The conventional approach to this section is explained by Wilcox and Cooper JJ in David s Distribution Pty Ltd v National Union of Workers   FCA         FCR   at     in these terms     Section  L l  requires that the applicant prove the employee was dismissed from his or her employment  It also requires it to be proved that the employee was at the time of the dismissal dissatisfied with his or her industrial conditions and was a member of an industrial association that was seeking better industrial conditions  In order to make the link between the dismissal and the circumstances which the applicant must establish to bring the dismissal within s  K  the Act provides in s  V a statutory presumption that the link exists in certain circumstances  Under s  V in proceedings under Div   of Pt XA of the Act for a contravention of a section in Pt XA  an allegation in those proceedings of conduct for a prohibited reason is sufficient for it to be presumed that the conduct was engaged for that reason unless the employer proves to the contrary  Section  V does not relieve the applicant in proceedings under Div   of Pt XA of the Act from proving  on the balance of probabilities  each of the ingredients of the contravention  It enables the allegation to stand as sufficient proof of the fact unless the employer proves otherwise  R v Hush  Ex parte Devanny   HCA         CLR   at  citedMcIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  These proceedings were commenced on   May   and have been the subject of extensive case management  Some aspects of the interlocutory steps  but not all  are described at   pages     of McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd   FCA   based upon a chronology put before me by the respondents as part of the respondents  application for non party discovery and leave to issue subpoenas   All of these steps demonstrate that the factual and legal controversy has been framed over a considerable period with many interlocutory orders directed to joinder of parties  amendments to the Statement of Claim  the filing of defences  amendments to the Defence  the provision of particulars  verified discovery  inspection  various interlocutory applications and the preparation of statements in support of the claim  statements in response and statements in reply  A considerable amount of time  energy  cost and intellectual effort has been directed by the parties to joining issue on the factual and legal controversy with extensive recourse to Court supervision and Court engagement   The trial of the action was to commence on Monday    October    However  approximately one week prior to the trial a question arose as to whether the trial would proceed on the issue of the alleged contravention with a separate hearing on the issue of compensation  As to the question of bifurcating the issues  I indicated that I was not prepared at that late stage to separate issues and required the applicant to provide particulars of the compensation claim  The preparation for trial throughout proceeded on the footing that particulars of the compensation claim would be provided to the respondents prior to trial  By consent  the trial was adjourned to   October to enable particulars of the compensation claim to be provided to the respondents  discussions to take place between the parties as to a proposed Reply by the applicant to the Amended Defence of the respondents and to deal with objections to evidence with the trial to commence on Monday    October   The essence of the Reply was to put in issue  as counsel for the applicant put it   whether or not what was offered to the named persons was  in fact  a genuine offer and whether what was offered amounted to a breach  of the Act  or not   page   line   of the Transcript   After hearing counsel for the respondents opposing leave  I stood the matter down briefly and took the view that the responsive matters the subject of the Reply were within the scope of the existing factual controversy  that no prejudice was demonstrated to the respondents in giving leave and that the question of whether a further contravention based upon s  K c  arose on the facts before the parties arising out of the statements was a conclusionary matter which could properly be raised  I gave short Reasons about those matters   McIlwain v Ramsey Food Packaging Pty Ltd   FCA   but directed that the third ground of contravention should be pleaded by way of a Further Further Amended Statement of Claim  F F A S C    Counsel for the applicant and the respondents took the view that the trial of the action would be concluded within two weeks commencing Monday    October and accordingly the commencement of the trial was adjourned until   October to enable the F F A S C to be formulated by the applicant and served on the respondents during the course of Thursday    October    I made it clear to counsel for the respondents that should the F F A S C raise further material facts which went beyond the scope of the facts raised in the statements exchanged between the parties  I would be willing to hear the respondents in relation to the F F A S C and determine whether the third ground of contravention should properly be the subject of leave in the context of the facts actually pleaded in the F F A S C as it emerged  The F F A S C was also to incorporate proper particulars of the compensation claim   On Monday    October at the commencement of the trial  the respondents opposed leave to amend the Further Amended Statement of Claim in accordance with a proposed F F A S C to introduce the third ground of contravention in reliance on s  K c  having regard to what was said to be the proper understanding of the scope and construction of that provision and particularly the

The Trustees of the Property of Cummins v Mary Cummins  supra  the High Court in considering the inferences drawn by Sackville J in Prentice v Cummins  from which the appeal came  was invited to consider the applicability of the reasoning that inferences are available to be drawn by reason of the application of the principles in Jones v Dunkel when the party against whom those inferences

termination of the entire cohort of employees at the South Grafton Abattoir at the material time  the respondents contend the termination conduct does not involve conduct directed to any one employee or a class of employees  Therefore  there is no conduct by an employer which can be characterised as discrimination or victimization of that employee  In other words  there is no conduct by a

appeal came  was invited to consider the applicability of the reasoning that inferences are available to be drawn by reason of the application of the principles in Jones v Dunkel when the party against whom those inferences might be drawn has elected to adduce no evidence in its case  Their Honours found it unnecessary to embark upon that matter as Sackville J did not err in putting his conclusion on its primary basis unassisted by Jones v Dunkel    See also  Luxton v Vines   HCA         CLR   per Dixon  Fullagar and Kitto JJ at pg   Jones v Dunkel   HCA         CLR   at pgs     per

Daniel Cummins v Mary Cummins   HCA     March   per Gleeson CJ and Gummow  Hayne  Hayden and Crennan JJ at    In drawing these inferences I have had regard to the scope of the allegations  the standard of proof and the characterisation of the conduct for the purposes of the Act   The applicant contends that the evidence establishes contraventions of s  K both independently of and having regard to s  V  As to the state of the evidence generally  I am satisfied the evidence supports the inferences I have drawn  The evidence giving rise to those inferences and the ultimate facts in issue have not been the subject of any evidence from the respondents and in particular  from Mr Ramsey  It seems to me  consistent with the approach adopted by Sackville J in Prentice v Cummins  supra  that as a matter of principle  an election by the respondents in the circumstances of the foundation for the  no case  submission provides a proper basis for drawing inferences consistent with the principles identified in Jones v Dunkel  supra  adverse to the respondents   However  even if the view put by the respondents is accepted that such an evidential burden does not arise until the applicant establishes an hypothecated case of a prohibited reason  the evidence in this case establishes at least a basis for an hypothesis that the conduct was carried out for the prohibited reasons alleged  No recourse to inferences in accordance with the principles in Jones v Dunkel  supra  is necessary to make out a basis for such an hypothesis  The tests  for example  articulated by their Honours Barwick CJ and Mason J     in the context of the formulation of the particular provisions in question in that case  reflect a slight threshold of evidence   Accordingly  each of the respondents has failed to demonstrate the alleged prohibited reasons were not an operative reason for the dismissal conduct  The First  Second and Fourth Respondents have failed to demonstrate that the alleged prohibited reasons were not an operation reason for a refusal to employ any one of the   individuals in these proceedings  that is  all claimants apart from Susan Young    I am satisfied that the evidence demonstrates there is no relevant differentiation between the respondents in terms of the dealings between employees and the broad operation of the South Grafton Abattoir  No doubt  particular entities associated with or related to Mr Ramsey or entities controlled by Mr Ramsey employ particular individuals and equally  there is very likely to be particular administrative or domestic arrangements between those companies in the provision or performance of services and tasks in connection with the operation of the abattoir  However  whatever the content of those internal arrangements might be  an abattoir requires individuals to perform work in order to function  Those individuals might be employed by any one of a number of companies and be supplied or deployed under contractual arrangements with other entities either related to or  in a practical sense  connected with the operator of the abattoir  For all practical purposes  the question is whether the abattoir as a functional operation  required a cohort of individuals in order to perform the various task specific functions and whether steps were put in place during the period of re engagement to offer employment to individuals  irrespective of the particular recruiting vehicle or entity used for that purpose  The evidence does not establish whether the Third Respondent was seeking to employ any person in the relevant period  Accordingly  the conduct of refusing to employ is confined to conduct on the part of the First  Second and Fourth Respondents citedBlackadder v Ramsey Butchering Services Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   May   Madgwick J made a declaration that the Third Respondent had breached the order of Commissioner Redmond dated   March   by failing to reappoint Mr Blackadder to the position he held immediately before the termination of his services on   October    Madgwick J imposed particular penalties upon the Third Respondent and made other orders for the payment of certain monies  Madgwick J concluded that a reinstatement order in exercise of the power conferred by the Act impliedly involved a return of the employee to the workplace  In the light of this finding  Madgwick J felt it unnecessary to decide whether the AWA contained an implied contractual obligation requiring the Third Respondent to provide the applicant with actual work  See Blackadder v Ramsey Butchering Services Pty Ltd   FCA     The Full Court  allowed an appeal in part by the Third Respondent although Tamberlin and Goldberg JJ took a different view of the reinstatement power under the Act to that of Moore J   The question of the order to be made by Madgwick J by way of injunctive relief was unable to be resolved between the parties and accordingly  Madgwick J on   May   made further orders and published a supplementary judgment  The order of   May   directed the Third Respondent to reinstate the applicant to the position in which he was employed prior to the termination of his employment  namely  a boner performing chilled boning work in that part of the respondent s premises known as the big boning room   Ultimately  on   April   the High Court set aside the orders of the Full Court of the Federal Court and allowed in part an appeal by Mr Blackadder  The High Court concluded that the scope of the power conferred by s  CH  of the Act was broader than simply a reinstatement of the contract of employment and extended to a restoration of the employment situation as it existed immediately before the termination   So far as practicable  the employee is to be given back his  job  at the same place and with the same duties  remuneration and working conditions as existed before the termination    Blackadder v

arise in the context of a lack of a vacancy because the applicant can readily show  by evidence  if there is a vacancy  The evidence would demonstrate that someone else was employed or there was an advertisement placed in a newspaper or other forum for a vacancy  Mr Hatcher puts it this way   It s not as if one needs to get inside the mind of the person making the decision to know what personally moved him  as it is when one alleges a prescribed reason    The contention is that the applicant must adduce evidence of an actual  not theoretical  vacancy and demonstrate a refusal to employ that individual for that vacancy  Once that level of precision is made out  s  V operates  In the absence of that evidence  s  V has no role to play citedEvans Deakin Pty Ltd v Sebel Furniture

quotedcitedBradshaw v McEwans Pty Ltd   ALR   The statistical data does not exclude the possibility that the circumstances confronting the abattoir in August   presented a stock shortage  However  the applicant has no obligation to exclude such a possibility  To the extent the statutory presumption applies  it is not rebutted by the respondents by reliance upon the evidence of Mr Davis  Mr Delaforce or Mr Broadway  Moreover  the circumstances appearing in the evidence as I have described give rise to reasonable inferences concerning a reason for termination and subsequent refusal to employ which are not merely conflicting inferences of equal degree of probability  In drawing such inferences  their Honours Dixon  Williams  Webb  Fullagar and Kitto JJ in Bradshaw v McEwans Pty Ltd   ALR   at pg   observed     All that is necessary  in drawing a particular inference  is that according to the course of common experience the more probable inference from the circumstances that sufficiently appear by evidence or admission  left unexplained  should be that the injury arose from the defendant s negligence  By more probable is meant no more that upon a balance of probabilities such an inference might reasonably be considered to have some greater degree of likelihood         The general principle was put by their Honours at page   in these terms       Of course as far as logical consistency goes many hypotheses may be put which the evidence does not exclude positively  But this is a civil and not a criminal case  We are concerned with probabilities  not with possibilities  The difference between the criminal standard of proof in its application to circumstantial evidence and the civil is that in the former the facts must be such as to exclude reasonable hypotheses consistent with innocence while the latter you need only circumstances raising a more probable inference in favour of what is alleged  In questions of this sort where direct proof is not available  it is enough if the circumstances appearing in the evidence give rise to a reasonable and definite inference  they must do more than give rise to conflicting inferences of equal degrees of probability so that the choice between them is a mere matter of conjecture  But if circumstances are proved in which it is reasonable to find a balance of probabilities in favour of the conclusion sought then though the conclusion may fall short of certainty  it is not to be regarded as a mere conjecture or surmise  citedLuxton v Vines   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA

   It is true that wage slips for a number of the employees demonstrate that an entity other than the original employer was making wage payments  However  there is no evidence that any of the employees consented to an assignment or transfer of their employment  No new AWA was submitted to any of the employees which might have actively drawn to the attention of each individual the proposal to transfer their employment to a new entity and in the face of which an actual or implied consent might have arisen  The payment of wages by one Ramsey company might simply have reflected an administrative arrangement within the Ramsey group of companies for the discharge of that obligation  I can find no evidence which satisfies me that an assignment of the AWA occurred  In Noakes v Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ld   A C    at   Viscount Simon L C   observed     Counsel for the appellant argued that a contractual right to personal service was a personal right of the employer and was incapable of being transferred by him to anyone else and that a duty to serve a specific master could not be part of the property or rights of that master capable of becoming  by transfer  a duty to serve someone else  It is  of course  indisputable that  apart from a statutory provision to the contrary  the benefit of a contract entered into by A to render personal service to X cannot be transferred by X to Y without A s consent  which is the same thing as saying that  in order to produce the desired result  the old contract between A and X would have to be terminated by notice or by mutual consent and a new contract of service entered into by agreement between A and Y  The rule is so strict that if the contract is between individuals on both sides and X dies  the contract of service is immediately dissolved Farrow v Wilson  citation omitted    citedTextile Footwear and Clothing Union of Australia v Bellechic Pty Ltd   Ors   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In the present case there is no express assignment from the third respondent or the first respondent to the transferee entities  The evidence of the pay slips do not sustain an inference that the presumptive assignment was ever accepted by any of the employees  In Textile Footwear and Clothing Union of Australia v Bellechic Pty Ltd   Ors   FCA     Ryan J at pg   expressed doubt whether the nomination of a new employer on pay slips  the issuing of group certificates and the payment of superannuation contributions could give rise to an inference that a presumptive assignment was ever accepted by the individual employees  Further  there is no evidence which demonstrates that the precise inter relationship between the respondent entities or any other entity within the Ramsey group of companies relevantly associated with the abattoir operations  was ever brought to the active understanding of the employees  The much more likely inference is that any employee who became conscious of the title of a particular entity assumed that entity discharged an administrative organisational role on behalf of the relevant employer  There is no basis on the evidence for elevating those matters to the position of an actual or implied consent to an assignment  In addition  as between the abattoir operation and employees  the evidence does not suggest any conscious differentiation between particular entities  Exhibit   identifies the various methods adopted by the respondents for the description of the respondents  Examples are these   Deponent Exhibit

with our notice given on   August      These references suggest that no particular differentiation as between the respondents was a matter of emphasis to Mr Ramsey in the dealings with the employees  The operation was the South Grafton Abattoir and the particular arrangements of entities and the roles they performed in the conduct of the abattoir was a matter of internal domestic organisation   In support of the notion that invoking a stock shortage by the respondent employers was a construct to obfuscate the termination of the employees for a prohibited reason  the applicant says significant financial advantages accrued to the employers by invoking a stock shortage rather than making the employees redundant  The argument is put this way  Clause   deals with shortages of stock  Clause     concerning weekly employees is in these terms     Where the employer  on account of shortage of stock  gives notice of termination of employment to a weekly employee and immediately upon the expiration of that notice employs him as a casual employee  such employee shall be paid in any week after such expiration in which less than five days work is offered  at the rate of     th of the appropriate weekly rate plus   for each day worked         Nothing in cl    requires the employer to effect the termination  The clause creates certain consequences in the circumstances of the clause  Clause   deals with termination  change and redundancy  The clause applies in respect of full time and part time employees in the classifications described within the AWA  Clause     provides       Where the employer terminates the services of employees as the direct result of seasonal factors affecting the meat industry or shortages of livestock  the employer shall not be required to pay

conventional approach to this section is explained by Wilcox and Cooper JJ in David s Distribution Pty Ltd v National Union of Workers   FCA         FCR   at     in these terms     Section  L l  requires that the applicant prove the employee was dismissed from his or her employment  It also requires it to be proved that the employee was at the time of the dismissal dissatisfied with his or her industrial conditions and was a member of an industrial association that was seeking better industrial conditions  In order to make the link between the dismissal and the circumstances which the applicant must establish to bring the dismissal within s  K  the Act provides in s  V a statutory presumption that the link exists in certain circumstances  Under s  V in proceedings under Div   of Pt XA of the Act for a contravention of a section in Pt XA  an allegation in those proceedings of conduct for a prohibited reason is sufficient for it to be presumed that the conduct was engaged for that reason unless the employer proves to the contrary  Section  V does not relieve the applicant in proceedings under Div   of Pt XA of the Act from proving  on the balance of probabilities  each of the ingredients of the contravention  It enables the allegation to stand as sufficient proof of the fact unless the employer proves otherwise  R v Hush  Ex parte Devanny   HCA         CLR   at   In

provided that in any proceeding for an offence against the section  if all the facts and circumstances constituting the offence  other than the reason for the defendant s action  are proved  it shall lie upon the defendant to prove that he was not actuated by the reason alleged in the charge and observed     The circumstances by reason of which an employer may take action against an employee are  of necessity  peculiarly within the knowledge of the employer  It is for this reason that s   is of such importance it has the effect of shifting the onus of proof to the employer with the result that the employer is obliged to prove a negative if he is to avoid being found guilty of the offence charged if all the other facts and circumstances constituting the offence are proved  The onus so cast upon the employer is to prove a negative on a preponderance of probabilities    The point of distinction the respondents seek to demonstrate is this  The majority judgment in David s Distribution v NUW properly understood  is not authority for the proposition that a bare allegation of a prohibited reason in respect of proven or admitted conduct  for example  termination of employment  is sufficient to cast an onus of  proving otherwise  upon the respondents  The reasons   to   demonstrate  it is said  that evidence was available by reason of inferences that the dismissed picketers were actuated by dissatisfaction with their industrial conditions  that the employees banded together in part for that reason and that a statement by a David s Distribution management officer  Mr Johnson  provided evidence of at least a serious question to be tried of a reason for dismissals which was a prohibited reason  The evidence of a prohibited reason concerning Mr Johnson was not denied by him  David s further contended that the termination of employment affected all the picketers equally  no individual was selected and the only inference open was that termination was referrable to picketing conduct  David s contended that because the evidence was consistent with non prohibited reasons  the mere allegation of a prohibited reason cannot operate to place an onus upon the respondents  Their Honours  Wilcox and Cooper JJ said     The difficulty with this submission is the uncontradicted evidence of Mr Joseph that  on   July   Mr Johnson  informed him that David s intended to terminate another ten people      The statement of Mr Johnson was itself evidence that there was a serious question to be tried that there was a different or additional reason for the dismissals  which was a prohibited reason  citedGreater Dandenong City Council v Australian Municipal  Administrative  Clerical and Services Union   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The combined effect of these provisions is to introduce an additional element of discrimination into the conduct prohibited by s  K so that it is not enough to establish  for example  the dismissal  conduct  of an employee for a prohibited reason to satisfy s  K a   Rather the section  it is said  requires proof of the discriminatory dismissal of an employee for a prohibited reason  The essential difficulty with this construct is the failure to recognise that the legislative expression of the objectives of the Part is to be found in prohibiting nominated conduct by an employer carried out for a reason falling within s  L   That is the formulation that captures prohibitions upon discriminatory conduct or victimisation  It is the conjunction of the conduct carried out for a prohibited reason  among others  that gives the s  K conduct its discriminatory character  No other element need be superimposed upon the sections  That  however  is not to deny the relationship between the objects recited in s  A and the language of implementation in s  K and s  L  Those sections might generally be described in terms of prohibiting the vice of discrimination and victimisation but the precise formulation of the method of implementation is to be found in  conduct  for  a prohibited reason   The true role of Division   is not to impose a limitation upon the plain words of other provisions of the Act but to plot a point on the constitutional continuum of ensuring the Act in all its provisions is a valid law of the Commonwealth  See generally Greater Dandenong City Council v Australian Municipal  Administrative  Clerical and Services Union   FCA         FCR   per Wilcox J at     and     The respondents say that this notion of threshold discrimination has particular resonance in the application of s  V also within Pt XA with the result that before s  V can have any operation  the applicant must adduce evidence that demonstrates a reasonable hypothesis that conduct occurred for a prohibited reason and that such evidence was unchallenged or unaddressed  It will be recalled that s  V casts an onus upon the respondents in these circumstances     S V if             a  in an application number this Div relating to a person s     conduct  it is  alleged  that the  conduct  was  or is being  carried out for

supra  and National Union of Workers of Qenos Pty Ltd  supra  as authority for the proposition that there must be demonstrated  differential treatment  by an employer as against an individual employee or other person or an identified class of persons as against others  The decision in Heidt v Chrysler  supra  concerned a challenge to the dismissal of an employee on grounds that the dismissal was actuated by reason of the employee s membership of the Union  his entitlement to an award and his membership of a Union that was seeking better conditions about which he was dissatisfied  The respondents rely upon this passage from the judgment of Northrop J at page      Counsel for the informant did not argue that the defendant had failed to prove that  in dismissing the informant  it had not been actuated by reason of either of the circumstances that the informant was a member of an organisation or was entitled to the benefit of an award  To so argue would have been futile  It was a condition of his employment by the defendant that the informant become and remain a member of the organisation  The award was binding on the defendant with respect to all employees coming within the scope of the award  whether members of the organisation or not  I find that the defendant  in dismissing the informant  was not actuated by reason of the circumstance that the informant was a member of an organisation  nor by reason of the circumstance that the informant was entitled to the benefit of an ward  citedTransport Workers  Union v De Vito     IR   There is no doubt the applicant has the onus of establishing the causes of action on the balance of probabilities but s  V effects a discharge of that onus once the relevant conduct is proven and the allegation of a prohibited reason made  Although the respondents rely upon observations of Ryan J in Transport Workers  Union v De Vito     IR   at   his Honour was simply observing that when the conduct itself is put in issue  the applicant has an evidentiary onus of establishing that matter before the respondent is called upon to satisfy an onus of proving a reason other than the alleged prohibited reason  The two classes of conduct asserted here are  dismissing an employee  and  refusing to employ another person   It may be that the content of other classes of conduct   altering the position of an employee to the employee s prejudice  or  discriminating against another person in the terms or conditions of an offer of employment  require greater forensic evidence of the character of the conduct before an onus as to a prohibited reason falls to the respondent  In any event  that is not the case here quotedcitedGeneral Motors Holden Pty Ltd v Bowling     ALR   The respondents rely upon the observations of both Barwick CJ  in dissent  and Mason J  in the majority  in General Motors Holden Pty Ltd v Bowling     ALR    In that case  GMH dismissed an employee who was a member and delegate of the relevant union  on the articulated basis of the employee s unsatisfactory attitude to work and supervision  Section   of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act      Cth  prohibited GMH from dismissing Bowling by reason of his being a member or delegate of the union  The majority of the industrial court convicted GMH of dismissing Bowling by reason of his position as a delegate  In considering the onus provision in GMH s appeal  Barwick CJ at   said this     I now turn to s   and the use which may properly be made of it  The precise terms of that subsection are          s   In any proceeding for an offence against this section  if all the facts and circumstances constituting the offence  other than the reason for the defendant s action are proved  it shall lie upon the defendant to prove he was not actuated by the reason alleged in the charge         It is a little difficult to state what are the element of the offence against s  a  other than the reasons for the appellant s action  but  presumably  if effect is to be given to the provision  the dismissal itself is the other  and indeed the only other  element of the offence      In my opinion  before resort can be had to this onus provision  there must be before the court evidence which reasonably warrants the conclusion that the circumstance that the employee had been placed in the appropriate office of his union was possibly a reason for his dismissal  If  on the evidence  there is no basis for concluding that that circumstance might be or have been a reason for the dismissal  there is no room for requiring the employer to negative the proposition that that circumstance was such a reason   Accordingly  the respondents here say that there must first be some evidence that the reason alleged was  possibly a reason  and if there is  no basis  for concluding that the particular circumstance might have been a reason  the onus of demonstrating otherwise does not arise  Two things should be noted  First  this is nevertheless a slight basis for enlivening the operation of the respondents  onus and  secondly  the reason in question had to be a  substantial and operative reason    A requirement to demonstrate some evidence of such a circumstance before enlivening the respondents  onus is neither surprising in the context of a requirement to demonstrate a substantial and operative reason nor applicable to a position where the question is whether the prohibited reason was simply a reason for the conduct   Mason J put the matter this way at pg      Section   imposed the onus on the appellant of establishing affirmatively that it was not actuated by the reason alleged in the charge  The consequence was that the respondent  in order to succeed  was not bound to adduce evidence that the appellant was actuated by that reason  a matter peculiarly within the knowledge of the appellant  The respondent was entitled to succeed if the evidence was consistent with the hypothesis that the appellant was so actuated and that hypothesis was not displaced by the appellant   Therefore  it is said  consistent with the views of Barwick CJ and Mason J  the applicant must adduce evidence  consistent with the hypothesis  that the respondents were actuated by a prohibited reason  It seems to me that the hypothesis is the allegation and the evidence is consistent with it  However  his Honour  Mason J  also said at pg      To hold that  despite the subsection  there is some requirement that the prosecutor brings evidence of this fact is to make an implication which  in my view  is unwarranted and which is at variance with the main purpose of the provision in throwing on to the defendant the onus of proving that which lies peculiarly within his own knowledge   The notion that evidence must be consistent with a hypothesis and the recognition that the statutory objective is to place the onus on the defendant in respect of those matters peculiarly within his own knowledge  seems to me to not require actual evidence of purpose on the part of the applicant quotedcitedMaritime Union of Australia v Geraldton Port Authority   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases

the judgment of the Full Court of the Federal Court in BHP Iron Ore Pty Ltd v Australian Workers  Union   Ors   FCA         FCR    In so doing  the respondents press their contention that some element of discriminatory conduct must be demonstrated  as an additional element of the section  not merely conduct coupled with an allegation of a prohibited reason  there must be some evidence consistent with the discriminatory hypothesis and the conduct must be intentional conduct directed to  an employee  or  other person    At pg   their Honours Black CJ  Beaumont and Ryan JJ made this observation     It has to be borne in mind  in construing s  K  that it proscribes conduct by  an employer  directed to  an employee  or  other person    That use of the singular suggests that the alleged injury or alteration of position has to be examined in the light of the circumstances of each individual employee   It is not the point that in the interpretation of statutes  the singular ordinarily includes the plural  here we are concerned with the indications of legislative intention to be discerned from the actual language used   It is also significant that the conduct struck at by each paragraph of s  K is expressed by an active verb   dismiss   injure   alter the position   refuse to employ  and  discriminate    That implies that the proscription is essentially against an intentional act of the employer directed to an individual employee or prospective employee   There can be no doubt that s  K  addresses  consistent with the Full Court s observations in BHP Iron Ore Pty Ltd v Australian Workers  Union   Ors  supra  bilateral conduct between an employer and an employee or an employer and another person  That simply means however that the circumstances of the conduct  dismissal  injury  alternation of position  refusal to employ or discrimination in terms and conditions of that offer of employment  affecting each individual must be examined to determine whether the conduct was undertaken for a prohibited reason  If the expression of the conduct involves a group of affected individuals  the circumstances of each individual within the group must be examined  The broader the group  the less likely as a matter of logic and probability that individuals within it are the subject of prohibited reasons for the conduct  A group of individuals will generally exhibit a unifying characteristic that defines the boundaries of the group and it may well be that that characteristic provides an explanation of the reason for the conduct affecting the group  Nevertheless  individuals within the group  upon examination  may on a bilateral basis  be the subject of conduct for a reason prohibited by the Act  as alleged  In other words  the dismissal of   employees would not provide an answer to a contravention of s  K a  if   of those   were dismissed because they elected to take up membership of a union  act as a delegate  express dissatisfaction with conditions of employment supported by the union  or secured an order of the AIRC to address constructive dismissal in harsh and unjust circumstances  The question is always what was the conduct of the employer qua the employee  in the circumstances   In many cases  where a broader group or class is the subject of the conduct  the employer will be in a position  and uniquely so  to demonstrate persuasively that the circumstances affecting the group reflect a level of abstraction that removes qua any member  a circumstance constituting a prohibited reason  Although the section requires an analysis of the bilateral circumstances between the employer and the individual  conduct applying to a group does not  by that circumstance alone   extinguish any operation for the section  Justice Kenny put the notion slightly differently but to the same effect when her Honour said in Australian Workers  Union and Others v BHP Iron Ore Pty Ltd   FCA   at   upon remitter from the Full Court     Section  K  is  upon this view  concerned with the conduct of an employer that is directed to an individual employee  This does not mean that in dismissing one employee who is a union member for a prohibited reason  an employer commits a civil wrong  and that wrong is not committed if  for the same reason  the employer dismisses all employees who are union members  The Full Court was directing its attention to the nature of the injury contemplated by the provision  That is  the conduct in question must injure an employee individually in the sense that it would have injured him or her  regardless of whether it was actually done to an individual employee or a group of employees   The relevant inquiry is whether an employer has  by the employers conduct  injured the position of an employee individually  The Full Court must have intended to exclude conduct that injured individuals only when directed to a class of employees  Before s  K  can apply  it must be possible to say of an employee that he or she is  individually speaking  in a worse situation after the employer s acts than before them  that the deterioration has been caused by those acts  and that the acts were intentional in the sense that the employer intended the deterioration to occur    emphasis added citedHealth Services Union of Australia v Tasmania     IR   There must be  therefore  it

Weinberg J recognises at   and   the susceptibility of what I might call distributed conduct  and not merely bilateral conduct  to the reach of s  K  illustrated in the circumstances of Patrick Stevedores Operations No    Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia  supra   His Honour said this     There  the conduct impugned was a decision by the employers to dismiss all members of the MUA in their employ  and to ensure that no funds were available to meet the legal obligations owed to those employees      It is one thing for an employer to decide to dismiss all the employees forthwith because of their membership of a particular union  That conduct falls squarely within s  K  It is conduct which is directed to individual employees in the sense spoken of by the Full Court in BHP Iron ore Pty Ltd v Australian Workers  Union  albeit all individual employees  quotedcitedEmployment Advocate v Williamson   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  His Honour concluded that the  spill and fill  proposal for the selection of certain employees within a group for involuntary redundancy was not  sufficiently proximate  to any of the forms of contravening conduct contained within s  K  Dismissal of all employees for a prohibited reason is squarely within s  K notwithstanding that they represent potentially a large group  Dismissal of employees for a prohibited reason within a group of employees some of whom may be dismissed for a non prohibited reason does not remove the individual or bilateral character of the prejudicial conduct on the part of the employer as against that employee  It would be an odd thing if the statutory quality of contravening conduct in respect of some employees could be dissolved amongst a group and remedial entitlements otherwise available to the affected individuals thereby lost  The question is whether the conduct  from the standpoint of the individual  notwithstanding others  represents conduct carried out for a prohibited purpose  It seems to me that the observations of Gray J in Employment Advocate v Williamson   FCA         FCR   at        What is clear  however  is that for a contravention of s  K to occur  there must be a person or persons who fall within the description in one or more of the prohibitive reasons       and at        It must be possible to identify some person or persons who answer the description in at least one of the prohibitive reasons in s  L          does not contradict the notion that an individual may fall within the description of the conduct even though such an individual forms part of a group such as that identified in the illustration by Weinberg J   In this case  the employer entities dismissed a cohort of employees  Some of those employees  from their individual standpoint  contend the dismissal was for a prohibited reason  They say the circumstances that give rise to that apprehension can be seen in the attitude of Mr Ramsey to the AMIEU  his hostility to the participation of the Union in the workplace and the consequences of Union engagement in various processes before the AIRC and the dissatisfaction nine of the   individuals were articulating about conditions of employment against the background of the steps taken by the Union  As to three of the individuals  their concern lies in the chronology of events arising out of their constructive dismissal and the subsequent treatment of the individuals consequent upon obtaining orders from the AIRC and particularly orders for reinstatement   The dismissal of the entire cohort of employees does not provide an answer to the essential character of the contravening conduct in respect of the particular individuals  The legislation provides a mechanism for an employer to demonstrate that the apprehended and thus alleged reasons for the dismissal are misplaced and incorrect by casting an onus upon the respondent to demonstrate otherwise   The same position obtains in relation to the conduct of refusing to employ the relevant individuals  In essence  the respondents say that in the case of each individual  the particular person was not available for employment  did not seek employment and was not denied employment  Moreover  before a refusal to employ an individual for a prohibited reason can arise  the individual must demonstrate that a vacancy was available to be filled   As to these matters  it is clear that the individuals did seek employment  Enquiries were made of management staff as to the availability of the work  Steps were taken to refuse immediate employment by some  but expressly for the purposes of trying to secure a return to work for all employees  Mr Delaforce and Mr Moss formulated a compromise proposal directed to securing the return to work for all employees  Some individuals were episodically offered employment on a day  sometimes after the event  Enquiries were made of management and in the immediacy of the dispute and enquiries were made at the gate as to those persons who were on the list for employment  The evidence demonstrates that jobs were available and vacancies were being filled  Subsequent offers  even though episodic  demonstrate that vacancies were there to be filled  Notwithstanding the lengthy period of employment on the part of the   individuals with the South Grafton Abattoir from the commencement of operations by Mr Ramsey and the pre existing historical connection with the abattoir in the Gilbertson s days  none of these individuals  leaving aside Susan Young  were offered full time employment or any sustained period of casual employment quotedcitedFraser v Fletcher Construction Australia Ltd     IR   On this issue  the respondents say this  In Fraser v Fletcher Construction Australia Ltd     IR   Moore J  sitting in the Industrial Relations Court of Australia  said         the expression  refuse to employ  deals with     actual employment where there is a
