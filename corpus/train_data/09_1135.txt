Humphries v Newport Quays Stage  A Pty Ltd  No     FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toFrith v Gold Coast Mineral Springs Pty Ltd   FCA         FLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe orders sought in this case are orders refusing to enforce  in the sense of recognising for the purposes of the respondent  damages claim  provisions in the relevant property contracts  The orders sought seem to be similar to orders varying provisions of contracts and that is an order which could be made under s   see s  b   The orders sought  or permissible variations of them  may  in the alternative  or in addition  fall within other paragraphs in s    see  for example  s  ba   An order varying the contract price under a contract may be made under the section  Frith v Gold Coast Mineral Springs Pty Ltd   FCA         FLR   at   per Fitzgerald J  It may be likely that Mr Humphries  case as a whole will stand or fall on his claim for rescission  However  having regard to the wide terms of s   and the authorities  it cannot be said that his alternative claim for relief is bound to fail  In other words  it is possible that Mr Humphries will succeed on his claims under the TPA and yet the Court will award the alternative relief claimed by him  In those circumstances  the respondent s challenge must fail  Paragraph   of Ms Humphries  Statement of Claim The respondents seek an order that paragraph   of Ms Humphries  Statement of Claim be struck out on the ground that it is embarrassing and has a tendency to cause prejudice and delay  Paragraph   is in the following terms       Peter Humphries passed on to the applicant the effect of what was being conveyed to him as described in this pleading prior to the applicant entering into the contracts  referred toGeneral Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways  NSW  and Others   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe respondents claim that this alternative claim is not maintainable as a matter of law and should be struck out  They rely on the Court s power in O   r   of the Federal Court Rules to strike out part of a pleading which discloses no reasonable cause of action  In essence  their argument is that there are no circumstances in which Mr Humphries  claim for rescission would fail and yet his claim for alternative relief would succeed  In my opinion  Mr Humphries  claim for alternative relief is not unarguable in the sense referred to in the authorities   General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways  NSW  and Others   HCA         CLR   and the respondents  application in relation to Mr Humphries  claim for alternative relief must be refused  As I have said  Mr Humphries claims a right to rescind the property contracts  or an order under s   of the TPA that the property contracts have been rescinded  or are rescinded  He then makes the following allegations  in the alternative          Alternatively an order refusing to enforce the Contracts against the Applicant or alternatively that the Respondents be precluded from maintaining or acting upon the contract price being more than the market value or the settlement date being before the date on which allotments in Stage   commence to be sold or claiming that the Applicant is in default or is liable to pay or forfeit any monies to them       In the alternative to paragraph     above  an order that the First Respondent and the Second Respondent be permanently restrained from calling upon the Bank Guarantees        The claim for relief in paragraph     is for a declaration that the applicant is entitled to the destruction or return of the bank guarantees  The claims for relief in paragraphs     and     are based on earlier paragraphs which are challenged  Paragraph   is in the following terms        Alternatively  pursuant to section     an order should be made refusing to enforce the Property Contracts and the second Marina Berth Agreement against the Applicant or alternatively that Newport Quays   be precluded from              maintaining or acting upon the contract price being more than the true market value of the Properties being   for terrace No   and   for sky home No       maintaining or acting upon the contract price being more than the true market value of the second Marina Berth being       acting under clause     to claim that the Applicant is in default under the Property Contracts or the second Marina Berth Agreement or is liable to pay or forfeit any monies to Newport Quays  referred
