Consolidated Byrnes Holdings Limited ACN       v Hardel Investments Pty Limited ACN         FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toApplicant NAGM of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe categories of costs in which a court may order a non party to pay costs are not closed  Applicant NAGM of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR    In that case  at   the Court said    There are certain categories of cases in which the jurisdiction to award costs against a non party has been exercised  if not frequently  then with some degree of regularity  One such category is where the non party is considered to be the  real party  to the litigation  Knight v Special Assets at   per Mason CJ and Dean J  Another is where the non party is a legal representative of a party to the proceedings  A costs order may be made  for example  against a solicitor in consequence of his or her conduct in the litigation  Caboolture Park at    While s   of the Federal Court Act empowers the Court to make a costs order against a legal representative of a party  a second source of jurisdiction is the  implied   accrued  or  inherent  jurisdiction of the Court over its own officers  Caboolture Park at   notfollowedAustralian Forest Managers Ltd  in liq  v Bramley     ALR  That decision was approved by Lindgren J in Australian Forest Managers Ltd  in liq  v Bramley     ALR    In that case  Lindgren J said at     The terms of s   of the Law are mandatory  once a proceeding before a court is seen to be one  under  the Law  s   requires the costs of the proceeding to be borne by a party or parties  The court s discretion relates only to how the costs are to be so borne  Such terms are inconsistent with an exercise of the power given by s   of the FCA Act to order a non party to pay costs  The excepting words in s   of the FCA Act are apt to refer to  inter alia  a provision of such a nature  The non parties contended that I should follow the decision of Jenkinson J in Re Wridgemont Display Homes Pty Ltd   FCA       FCR   and Lindgren J in Australian Forest Managers Ltd  in liq  v Bramley   ALR    Both those decisions were given prior to the enactment of the Corporations Act but s   has been re enacted in the Corporations Act   There is nothing in the Corporations Act itself which would allow those decisions to be distinguished  I should as a matter of comity and unless I think the decisions to be plainly wrong follow them  The decision in U T S A  v Ultra Tune   VR   was followed by Brereton J in Re Struthers  liq of Project Management  Architecture and Construction Interiors Pty Ltd   No     NSWSC         ACSR    His Honour said at       At first sight  the suggestion that the Commonwealth Parliament has enacted a provision to detract from the existing costs powers of courts in which it invests jurisdiction to deal with proceedings under the Corporations Act is a surprising one  But were it not for the judgment of Chernov J in UTSA   despite these initial impressions about s     I would unquestionably have followed Wridgemont and Australian Forest Managers   particularly given Lindgren J s strong endorsement of Wridgemont   and also given that those cases had been followed in this court by Bergin J  However  in circumstances where there has been  since Australian Forest Managers   what impresses me as a compelling analysis of the history and purpose of the section by Chernov J   the benefit of which does not appear to have been afforded to Bergin J when her Honour came to consider the point   and where Ryan J  albeit without reference to the authorities  had adopted an opposite approach  I consider that I am at liberty to give effect to my own views      I agree with Chernov J that s   should not be construed as a limiting provision  but as an enabling one  Its history shows that it was intended to confer a jurisdiction or a power to make costs orders when there was doubt as to the existence that power  at least in the equitable jurisdiction of this court in this state  If there were no s     the court would not be without power to make costs orders in proceedings under the Act  it would have all its powers under the Supreme Court Act and the Civil Procedure Act  Section   was not intended to limit such other powers to make costs orders as the court already enjoyed  but to supplement them  In my opinion  the current provisions ought not be taken as intended to exclude the power of courts under  for example  Civil Procedure Act  s   and UCPR  r     to make costs orders which are designed to protect the processes of the courts and the integrity of those processes and the procedural rights of parties who litigate in those courts  The defendants contended that in the event that the decisions of this Court in Re Wridgemont Display Homes Pty Ltd   FCA       FCR   and in Australian Forest Managers Ltd  in liq  v Bramley   ALR   are to be preferred to the decisions of in U T S A  Pty Ltd  In liquidation  v Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltd   VR   and Re Struthers  liq of Project Management  Architecture and Construction Interiors Pty Ltd   No     NSWSC       ACSR   then I should make an order joining the non parties as parties for the purpose of avoiding the consequences of s    The Master thought he was constrained by the decisions in Re Wridgemont Display Homes Pty Ltd   FCA       FCR   and in Australian Forest Managers Ltd  in liq  v Bramley   ALR   from ordering costs against persons who were not parties  However  he was of the opinion that O     of the Supreme Court Rules of the Northern Territory  which provides for the costs liability of a legal practitioner where the legal practitioner has caused costs to be incurred improperly or without reasonable cause or be wasted by undue delay or negligence or by some other misconduct or default  was not in conflict with either the Corporations Regulations or s   appliedAustralian Securities Commission v Australian Home Investments Ltd     ALR  It is not possible to determine whether the statutory demands were in fact ever served on the defendants in accordance with the Act  Mr Byrnes contends they were and the defendants contend they were not received  That was an issue to be determined at the trial but the proceedings were dismissed for the reasons given  I do not think  in the absence of hearing the witnesses whose evidence is relevant to this issue and particularly Mr Byrnes  the issue can be resolved  Moreover  the resolution of that issue would be undesirable after the proceedings were dismissed at the behest of the defendants  Australian Securities Commission v Australian Home Investments Ltd     ALR   at   citedBaillieu Knight Frank v Ted Manny Real Estate Pty Ltd     NSWLR  It will be an abuse of

the Federal Court determined that s   of the Bankruptcy Act empowered the Court to make an order for costs against the liquidator who was not a party in the bankruptcy proceeding citedBond Corporation Holdings Ltd     WAR  That finding is enough  it seems to me  to make the order sought by the defendants that the plaintiffs pay the defendants  costs on an indemnity basis  In the matter of Bond Corporation Holdings Ltd     WAR     Packer v Meagher     NSWLR    In Ragata Developments Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation     ALR     Davies J said at         it is not open to an individual Judge to award costs having regard to his own view as to the adequacy of party party costs so fixed  An award of costs on an indemnity basis may be made only in a special case  where the circumstances justify departure from the ordinary principle  The circumstances must be such as to justify an award indemnifying the successful party in respect of all of the costs incurred  save only as to those costs which are unreasonable in amount      The very nature of the award of costs on an indemnity basis gives a guide to the type of case in which such an award is appropriate  Thus  indemnity costs may be awarded where unsuccessful proceedings have been brought and prosecuted  not for the bona fide purpose of protecting and enforcing a legal right  but to achieve an ulterior or extraneous purpose     However  there are further reasons for making the orders notfollowedBoscaini v Corporation of Kensington and Norwood   SASC  http www austlii edu au au cases sa SASC  htmlDebelle J agreed with the decision in Gribbles Pathology Pty Ltd v Health Insurance Commission   FCR   in Boscaini v Corporation of Kensington and Norwood   SASC   and said at     I immediately acknowledge the assistance of Hill J but suggest that proposition   is of limited assistance  The fact that a party has not conducted himself reasonably may disentitle him to costs  But  beyond that  the reasonableness of the conduct of the parties is not likely to assist in determining whether the applicant should recover his costs  The real question is whether the applicant had reasonable prospects of success  It seems preferable  therefore  to express proposition   in different terms  The three questions I have posed mean that I disagree with respect with Debelle J s decision in Boscaini v Corporation of Kensington and Norwood   SASC    A party may behave so unreasonably in the bringing or conducting of proceedings so that an order for costs against that party is required in the interests of justice without ever deciding whether the party had a good cause of action appliedCaboolture Park Shopping Centre Pty Ltd  in liquidation  v White Industries  Qld  Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe decision in Knight v F P  Special Assets Ltd   HCA       CLR   and its application to s   of the Federal Court Act was considered by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Caboolture Park Shopping Centre Pty Ltd  in liquidation  v White Industries  Qld  Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    The Full Court said at     There seems no reason to doubt that s   confers upon the court jurisdiction to award costs not only against persons who are parties but also against persons who are not  Clearly the section is no narrower than the provisions of O   r   of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Queensland considered by the High Court in Knight v FP Special Assets   In Caboolture Park v White Industries   FCA       FCR     it was argued that the Court s jurisdiction under s   to award costs ceased at the time that judgment was entered  It was submitted in that case that  once the original action or proceedings had been completed by entry of judgment there was no longer a  proceeding  before the Court in respect of which a cost order could be made   at    That argument was rejected by the Court as being inconsistent with the definition of  proceeding  in s   of the Federal Court Act which is defined to mean        a proceeding in a Court  whether between parties or not  and includes an incidental proceeding in the course of  or in connexion with  a proceeding  and also includes an appeal The Court said at     The context of the Act provides no indication that the words defining the grant of jurisdiction in s   of the Act have a temporal meaning which limits the jurisdiction conferred to a jurisdiction which terminates when a judgment has been pronounced and extracted in the proceeding that has invoked the jurisdiction     The Court said at     What s   requires is that the jurisdiction to order costs be one limited to costs relating to a proceeding  In other words  there is no jurisdiction to order costs at large  There has to be or have been  within the Court s jurisdiction  instituted a proceeding  It is irrelevant  subject to the application of common law principles discussed later  that judgment has been given and entered  As I have already observed  the first argument was rejected by the Court following the decision of this Court in Caboolture Park v White Industries   FCA       FCR    His Honour then turned to consider the effect of s    Section   of the SC Act  Vic  relevantly provided    Unless otherwise expressly provided by this or any other Act or by the Rules  the costs of and incidental to all matters in the Court     is in the discretion of the Court and the Court has full power to determine by whom and to what extent the costs are to be paid  The Master relied upon two decisions for the second proposition that the rule was not inconsistent with s   Myers v Elman   AC   and Caboolture Park v White Industries   FCA       FCR    I am not sure how those cases support the proposition that there is no conflict between the Rules of Court of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory and s   of the Corporations Act   The first case stands for the proposition that the High Court in England has power to order a solicitor to indemnify a party who has been injured by the solicitor s default  The power rests upon the Court s jurisdiction over its own officers  That proposition can no longer be doubted  The second case  a decision to which I have already referred  is authority for the proposition that the Federal Court has the power to award costs against a non party and  in that case  the solicitors for a party  The power to award costs against a non party  and in particular against a solicitor  are not the questions in issue  The question  further refined  is whether the Court can award costs against a legal practitioner who is a non party  The Master  it seems to me  with respect  did not address that issue  The categories of costs in which a court may order a non party to pay costs are not closed  Applicant NAGM of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR    In that case  at   the Court said    There are certain categories of cases in which the jurisdiction to award costs against a non party has been exercised  if not frequently  then with some degree of regularity  One such category is where the

 NSWSC         FLR   citedConstruction Enterprises Pty Ltd v Lafarge Plasterboard Pty Ltd   NTSC  The defendants relied upon a decision of Master Coulehan of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory in Construction Enterprises Pty Ltd v Lafarge Plasterboard Pty Ltd   NTSC   for the proposition that an order for costs could be made against solicitors without making the solicitors parties and notwithstanding s   of the Corporations Act   That case concerned an application to set aside a statutory demand pursuant to s  G of the Corporations Act   Shortly after the proceeding was commenced  the plaintiff was wound up by order of the Supreme Court of New South Wales  The defendant sought costs against the plaintiff s solicitor who had pursued the application on the part of the

amount to an abuse of process  Williams v Spautz   HCA         CLR   at      A winding up proceeding brought for a collateral purpose will be an abuse of process and will attract the Court s implied

for a penalty of imprisonment for a term not less than six months or more than   months for a second offence of selling liquor without a licence  The question for the Court was whether the exceptive words in s   meant that the Court could not exercise the power in s   to reduce a penalty to something less than imprisonment if the justice of the case would be better met  The Court said    Because this is so  exceptive words such as those which introduce s    have no legal effect beyond saving earlier enactments which otherwise would be inconsistent with the provision introduced  In regard to later enactments they  go no farther than the general law  Garnett v Bradley     App  Cas      at p    and  are not really necessary because if the later Act shows a contrary intention the earlier enactment cannot control it  But they remind us of the general rule   So Isaacs J  observed in Bennett v  Minister for Public Works  N S W     HCA         C L R      at p    speaking of the exceptive expression  unless the contrary intention appears   Whatever the verbal formula employed  it cannot have in regard to later legislation any greater force or value than that expression  As Keating J  remarked in Chorlton v  Lings   L R    C P     to do more would be exceeding the competency of parliament with reference to future legislation    L R    C P   at p        The Court said at     The general provision of s    of the Justices Act is accordingly prefaced by words which have a saving effect as regards earlier enactments and serve as a reminder in relation to later  meaning in regard to both that the general provision which follows is not to be denied any of its operation save by something actually inconsistent with it in the operation of another enactment  Section   authorises the Court to make an order for costs against a non party  The exceptive words in the body of s   do not by themselves limit the operation of s   by any later Act  Section   of the Federal Court Act was enacted before s   of the Corporations Act   It cannot control that subsection  A later Act could limit the operation of s   but that would raise the question of the construction of the later Act  Therefore  the question which is to be determined is whether s   as a later enactment has the effect of limiting the operation of s   to a party or a party to a proceeding brought under the Corporations Act   His Honour traced the legislative history of s    He noted that the English Judicature Acts of     did not address all of the anomalies which then existed in relation to the Court s powers in relation to costs  Costs in the common law courts were entirely creatures of statute  Garnett v Bradley     App Cas   at    On the other hand  the Court of Chancery claimed to have power to deal with costs at its discretion although there was some uncertainty as to the extent of that power  The authorities suggested that the position in equity continued after those Acts  He noted that s   of the Judicature Act    UK  which gave the Court expanded jurisdiction to award costs resolved the uncertainty  That section relevantly provided    subject to the     Acts and the Rules     and to the express provisions of any statute     the costs of and incidental to all proceedings in the Supreme Court     shall be at the discretion of the Court or Judge and the Court or Judge shall have full power to determine by whom and to what extent such costs are to be paid     He noted that it was not until   that s   of the Judicature Act    UK  was adopted in Victoria as s   of the Supreme Court Act    Vic   now s   of the SC Act  Vic   Section   gave the Court jurisdiction to deal with all questions of costs  including proceedings under the Companies Act  Before the Uniform Companies laws of   there was no equivalent of s   in the Victorian legislation  There was on his Honour s reasons no need for s   because s   gave the Court power to award costs in all proceedings and therefore s   was not picked up by the Victorian Companies Act of   or its consolidation in    He turned his attention to the New South Wales jurisdiction  He noted that New South Wales did not adopt the Judicature Acts until   when the Court was given the statutory provision equivalent to s   of the Judicature Act    UK   In the meantime  the predecessor of s   was introduced into the Companies Act    NSW   the Companies Act  by s    Section   eventually became s    His Honour said at     It seems fairly clear that this subsection was an enabling provision  intended to give the Supreme Court in New South Wales a similar discretion to that which was given to English Courts in   and to the Victorian Supreme Court in    Bearing in mind that s    or its equivalent  was in force in Victoria and England  there was no need to introduce in those jurisdictions a provision such as s    of the Companies Act of New South Wales  On the other hand  there was reason to pass such legislation in New South Wales in   if its Supreme Court was to have a wide discretion to award costs in a proceeding under the companies legislation  Because there was no general power in New South Wales of the kind given by s   of the Judicature Act  it was arguable that the Courts did not have the power to award costs in matters under the Companies Act  The enactment of s   was to put beyond doubt the Courts  power to award costs for proceedings under that Act  It was not enacted to limit the circumstances in which costs might be awarded  Thus it was that his Honour held that s   at the time of its introduction was an enabling provision  not a limiting provision  His Honour also noted that the equivalent of s   was not introduced into Victorian law until   at the time of the Uniform Companies legislation in the form of s    His Honour pointed out that there was no need to introduce such legislation into the Victorian Uniform Companies legislation because the position was covered by s   of the SC Act  Vic   Moreover  his Honour observed was that there was no need to continue with s   in the New South Wales legislation after the New South Wales Parliament adopted the Judicature Act in   but the provision has remained and has become s    For those reasons  his Honour found that s   was intended to be an enabling provision  not a limiting provision  In those circumstances  it did not limit the provisions of s   of the SC Act  Vic   His Honour concluded and said at     Whatever may be the position in relation to s    of the Federal Court of Australia Act   s    does not so inhibit the jurisdiction of this court on the question of costs as was contended for by the respondents  His Honour s analysis of the legislative history of s   in my opinion  has the same application in the construction of s   of the Federal Court Act citedGore v Justice Corporation Pty Ltd     FCR  It follows that this Court has the power to award costs against a person not a party to the proceedings  see also Gore v Justice Corporation Pty Ltd     FCR    The non parties argued that the Court could not now make an order that they pay costs because the proceedings had been dismissed by my orders made on   August   appliedGribbles Pathology Pty Ltd v Health Insurance Commission     FCR  In Gribbles Pathology Pty Ltd v Health Insurance Commission     FCR     Finkelstein J said at     For my own part I should wish to emphasise that in the absence of a hearing on the merits it is difficult to see how any order  other than an order that each party bear its own costs  can be made except in special circumstances  To do otherwise would require some prediction of the outcome of the case  It seems to me that the third proposition stated by Hill J was intended to cover the situation where the Court was in fact able to form a clear view about the merits of a case without a trial  So  if a claim is patently hopeless that would be a good reason to make an order for costs against the claimant  Likewise if a defence was bound to fail that would be good reason for awarding costs in favour of the claimant  But I venture to suggest that there will be very few cases where the issues will be sufficiently clear  in the absence of a hearing  for an order for costs to be made in favour of a party  Debelle J agreed with the decision in Gribbles Pathology Pty Ltd v Health Insurance Commission   FCR   in Boscaini v Corporation of Kensington and Norwood   SASC   and said at     I immediately acknowledge the assistance of Hill J but suggest that proposition   is of limited assistance  The fact that a party has not conducted himself reasonably may disentitle him to costs  But  beyond that  the reasonableness of the conduct of the parties is not likely to assist in determining whether the applicant should recover his costs  The real question is whether the applicant had reasonable prospects of success  It seems preferable  therefore  to express proposition   in different terms  Finkelstein J cast some doubt on the third principle referred to by Hill J  I do not need to decide whether I agree with the proviso mentioned by Finkelstein J because  in my opinion  at the very least this is one case where the issues are sufficiently clear  in the absence of a hearing  for orders for costs to be made  The plaintiffs  behaviour  which was demonstrated by Mr Byrnes  emails and correspondence generally prior to the commencement of proceedings  was quite unreasonable  Mr Byrnes behaved like a bully as he claimed to be  He threatened the defendants and Mr Harris with all sorts of commercial harm  His communications were calculated to induce fear into the defendants  His threats  if carried out  would have ruined the defendants in circumstances where he knew the defendants took issue with the debts  His actions were taken for the benefit of the plaintiffs and for the assignors  Cobra and Contor  The threats which were made prior to the proceedings commencing indicate that the proceedings were to be used for a collateral purpose  namely  the recovery of a debt  rather than for the purpose for which the proceedings were designed  namely  the winding up of an insolvent corporation  The proceedings were an abuse of the Court s processes referred toHardel Investments Pty Ltd  ACN       v Consolidated Byrnes Holdings Limited  ACN         FCA

proceedings were commenced in the New South Wales Registry of this Court on   March   by the plaintiffs seeking the winding up of the two defendants in the separate proceedings in insolvency pursuant to s  P of the Corporations Act    Cth   the Corporations Act    In both proceedings the plaintiffs claimed to be creditors of the defendants and relied upon the defendant s failure to comply with two statutory demands  They claimed that debts had been assigned to them  As I have said in   of these reasons  these reasons should be read with the reasons in Hardel Investments Pty Ltd  ACN       v Consolidated Byrnes Holdings Limited  ACN         FCA   given today  I have made no order for costs in that proceeding for the reasons given  However  the affidavit sworn by Peter William Harris on   April   which was filed in that other proceeding was used extensively in these proceedings and for the purpose of these reasons  Indeed  the defendants filed an affidavit in each of these proceedings sworn by Mr Harris on the same day in which he referred to and relied upon his affidavit sworn in the other proceeding  In that way the affidavit was used in these proceedings  It would be appropriate to allow the defendants the costs of that affidavit even though it was filed in the other proceeding because it contained the relevant information relied upon by the defendants for the defence of these proceedings  The costs which the defendants are entitled to recover on the orders in these proceedings shall include the costs of the preparation  swearing and filing of Mr Harris  affidavit

Full Court said at     There seems no reason to doubt that s   confers upon the court jurisdiction to award costs not only against persons who are parties but also against persons who are not  Clearly the section is no narrower than the provisions of O   r   of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Queensland considered by the High Court in Knight v FP Special Assets   The Federal Court Act and Rules recognise that the Court may make orders for costs against non parties in accordance with the general rules relating to costs  Knight v F P  Special Assets Ltd   HCA       CLR    That jurisdiction must carry with it the power to enforce any order that justice demands be made  If it be necessary to make an order that the non party be made a party so that an order can be made that the non party pay that party s costs then it must be assumed that the Court has jurisdiction to make the non party a party to the proceeding  Order   rule   gives that power to the Court  Where it appears that a non party ought to be held liable to pay a party s costs the Court can  in my opinion  utilise O   r  b  to join that non party to the proceeding  It follows therefore that if I am of the opinion that any of the non parties should be ordered to pay the defendants  costs and contrary to my opinion s   prevents any such order being made  I can make an order joining those non parties as parties to the proceedings  Mason CJ and Deane J  with whom Gaudron J agreed  said in Knight v F P  Special Assets Ltd   HCA       CLR   at       For our part  we consider it appropriate to recognize a general category of case in which an order for costs should be made against a non party and which would encompass the case of a receiver of a company who is not a party to the litigation  That category of case consists of circumstances where the party to the litigation is an insolvent person or man of straw  where the non party has played an active part in the conduct of the litigation and where the non party  or some person on whose behalf he or she is acting or by whom he or she has been appointed  has an interest in the subject of the litigation  Where the circumstances of a case fall within that category  an order for costs should be made against the non party if the interests of justice require that it be made  It cannot be thought  as some of the non parties contended  that the High Court was intending to lay down the only category of case in which an order for costs may be made against a non party  The discretion to award costs against a non party is unfettered except that it must be exercised judicially  Having said that  the cases identify the principles upon which the exercise of the discretion might be exercised  The categories of costs in which a court may order a non party to pay costs are not closed  Applicant NAGM of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR    In that case  at   the Court said    There are certain categories of cases in which the jurisdiction to award costs against a non party has been exercised  if not frequently  then with some degree of regularity  One such category is where the non party is considered to be the  real party  to the litigation  Knight v Special Assets at   per Mason CJ and Dean J  Another is where the non party is a legal representative of a party to the proceedings  A

Australia Pty Ltd     ACLR     McLelland J said at     Proceedings by a person as creditor for the winding up of a company on the ground that it is unable to pay its debts will ordinarily be held to be an abuse of process      if the winding up proceedings are bound to fail eg if it is clear that the applicant will not be able to prove that he is a creditor within the meaning of s  b  of the Code  or will not be able to prove that the company is unable to pay its debts within the meaning of s  e      if the application is made for some improper purpose eg if the applicant is seeking to use the winding up proceedings to coerce a company into paying an alleged debt without affording the company a reasonable opportunity to ascertain or have it established that the debt is properly payable  or      if issues will arise in the winding up proceedings of a kind inappropriate for determination in such proceedings eg a substantial contest as to the existence or enforceability of a debt relied on by the applicant  which should properly be resolved in separate proceedings brought for that purpose  The question to be determined when it is asserted that the proceedings constitute an abuse of process is the purpose for which the proceedings have been brought  If the proceedings have been brought for an ulterior or collateral purpose  then the proceedings are an abuse of the Court s processes  The party who has initiated the proceedings may then be liable to pay the costs of the party against whom the proceedings were brought on an indemnity basis  The defendants  claims for indemnity costs against the plaintiffs and the non parties necessitate an examination of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the bringing of the winding up applications and the circumstances

of courts under  for example  Civil Procedure Act  s   and UCPR  r     to make costs orders which are designed to protect the processes of the courts and the integrity of those processes and the procedural rights of parties who litigate in those courts  Professor Dal Pont GE in Law of Costs  nd ed  LexisNexis Butterworths    says  after referring to Jenkinson J s decision                As a significant proportion of proceedings under the Corporations Law are heard before the Federal Court  it appears strange that that court   which by s   of its Act is conferred the jurisdiction to award costs in all proceedings before it except those  in respect of which any other Act provides that costs shall not be awarded    should be denied the jurisdiction to make a non party costs orders in this context  In that s   simply replicates the former s   of the Companies Code  enacted prior to the courts  recognition of a jurisdiction to order costs against non parties  it could not have been intended to deny that jurisdiction  Certainly this has not been the approach of other judges when ordering costs against directors  receivers or liquidators of companies as litigants  Moreover  s   deals with the court s discretion   not its jurisdiction  which is the province of s   and which is not expressed  e xcept as provided by any other Act           The fact remains that s   as a more specific provision than either s   or   could be argued to prevail  Even so  it does not necessarily follow that s   should be seen as ousting the operation of s   or   which provisions can arguably operate consistently with s    To remove any degree of uncertainty  however  it would be useful if the legislature either reworded s   to extend to non parties  or defined the term  party  more extensively  This is more pressing following the replacement of the Corporations Law with the Corporations Act    Cth  which comes within the phrase  any other Act  in s        In any case  Jenkinson J in Re Wridgemont Display Homes referred to O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   which empowers the court to order a person who is or claims to be a creditor  contributory or officer of the company to be added as a respondent in proceedings under the Corporations Law  According to his Honour  this power could circumvent the lack of jurisdiction just mentioned  allowing it to be exercised in a case where the court considers that such a person ought to bear the costs of the proceeding  Like Brereton J  I would have  but for the decision of Chernov J  followed the decisions at first instance in this Court  However  in my opinion  Chernov J s reasoning is compelling and I think should be adopted  For the reasons given by Chernov J in relation to the legislative history of s   s   does not limit the operation or reach of s   of the Federal Court Act  It would be surprising if Parliament intended in enacting the Corporations Act to limit the circumstances where this Court might make an order for costs to parties or parties to the particular proceeding and to exclude from the scope of an order for costs non parties who would  if it were not for the proceeding being brought under the Corporations Law  be liable to pay the costs of a party to the proceeding  The defendants contended that in the event that the decisions of this Court in Re Wridgemont Display Homes Pty Ltd   FCA       FCR   and in Australian Forest Managers Ltd  in liq  v Bramley   ALR   are to be preferred to the decisions of in U T S A  Pty Ltd  In liquidation  v Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltd   VR   and Re Struthers  liq of Project Management  Architecture and Construction Interiors Pty Ltd   No     NSWSC       ACSR   then I should make an order joining the non parties as parties for the purpose of avoiding the consequences of s    The defendants relied upon the dicta in Re Wridgemont Display Homes Pty Ltd   FCA       FCR   in support of this contention  In that case  Jenkinson J said that the obstacle which was presented by s   on his construction of that subsection  may  and in an appropriate case should  be obviated by the exercise of the power conferred by Order   rule   to join a non party whom the Court considers ought to bear the costs of the proceedings  The equivalent of O   r   is now rule     of the Corporations Rules  Rule     of the Corporations Rules provides that those rules apply to a proceeding in this Court under the Corporations Act   Rule    a   The rules also provide that the other rules of the Court apply to the extent they are relevant and not inconsistent with the Corporations Rules  Rule      It follows that an examination of the Corporations Rules must be made to determine whether a source of power exists for the joinder of non parties to a proceeding under the Corporations Act   Rule     deals with creditors  contributories and officers of a corporation and empowers the Court to give leave to allow such persons to be heard in a proceeding without becoming a party to the proceeding  Rule     provides      The Court may order that a person who is  or who claims to be  a creditor  contributory or officer of a corporation be added as a defendant to the proceeding  The Master thought he was constrained by the decisions in Re Wridgemont Display Homes Pty Ltd   FCA       FCR   and in Australian Forest Managers Ltd  in liq  v Bramley   ALR   from ordering costs against persons who were not parties  However  he was of the opinion that O     of the Supreme Court Rules of the Northern Territory  which provides for the costs liability of a legal practitioner where the legal practitioner has caused costs to be incurred improperly or without reasonable cause or be wasted by undue delay or negligence or by some other misconduct or default  was not in conflict with either the Corporations Regulations or s   citedRitter v Godfrey     KB  There can be no doubt  because these winding up proceedings were dismissed

of Victoria in U T S A  Pty Ltd  In liquidation  v Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltd   VSC         VR    His Honour held that orders for costs are truly supplemental and do not affect the legal impact of the earlier judgment  He said at     Consequently  it is my view that the entry of judgment in this case did not deprive the court of jurisdiction to hear and determine an application under s    of the Act for an order that the non party respondents pay U T A  s costs incurred in relation to its proceeding against U T S A  and Titan  It follows therefore that the Court would have jurisdiction to order costs against the non parties in these proceedings even though orders have already been made dismissing the proceedings  The non parties argued that s   of the Corporations Act is a bar to making an order in a proceeding under the Corporations Act against a non party  Section   provides    The costs of any proceeding before a court under this Act are to be borne by such party to the

Ltd  In liquidation  v Ultra Tune Australia Pty Ltd   VR   Chernov J was concerned with an application by the defendant to a proceeding for an order that two non parties pay the costs of the proceeding  His Honour assumed  but later decided otherwise  that the proceeding with which he was concerned was a proceeding under the Act  The two non parties sought to set aside the notice of motion seeking costs on two grounds  First  because judgment had been entered and therefore there was no jurisdiction for the Court to exercise its discretion under s   of the Supreme Court Act    Vic   SC Act  Vic  to order that costs be paid by the respondents  and secondly  because s   of the SC Act  Vic  which gave the Court jurisdiction to award costs was to be read subject to s   of the
