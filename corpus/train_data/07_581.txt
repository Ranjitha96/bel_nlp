Australian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Limited   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAustralian and International Pilots Association v Qantas Airways Limited   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  This proceeding commenced by application dated   March    A statement of claim was filed on the same day  Both the application and the statement of claim were subsequently amended  On   November   I ordered that the applicant s further amended statement of claim be struck out but granted leave to replead on or before   November   see   FCA    I expressed some scepticism as to whether a case under the former s  K of the Workplace Relations Act    Cth   the Act   could be pleaded conformably with the reasons which I gave for striking out the pleading  see   FCA   at     Not deterred the applicant filed a further amended application and a second further amended statement of claim on   November    By notice of motion dated   December   which was filed on   January   the respondent seeks an order striking out the proceeding  or alternatively  the second further amended statement of claim   The amended application sought the imposition of penalties on the respondent and orders for compensation  injunctions and declarations with respect to alleged contraventions of s  K of the Act    The further amended statement of claim was struck out because it did not plead facts sufficient to establish any contravention of s  K before that provision was repealed on   March    Specifically  it was held that the facts pleaded did not establish that when  in December   and February   the respondent announced a decision to transfer four Airbuses to Jetstar late in   and early in   and that those aircraft would not be crewed by its employees  it had thereby injured or prejudicially changed the position of particular employees or threatened to do either or both of these things   The relevant legislation is set out in my earlier reasons  see   FCA   at   to     The respondent raises many complaints about the amended pleading  They may be summarised as follows      No new material facts are pleaded which could support the allegation that the respondent had contravened s  K b  and or  c  on or before   March       Some conduct by the respondent which is said to be directed to the implementation of the December   decision such as the transfer of the aircraft and the loss of remuneration and leave entitlements occurred after   March   and yet is relied on to support alleged contraventions of s  K     The amended pleading is incomprehensible and embarrassing  This is because  in para  B  the applicant contends that the making and communication of the   decision  which occurred before   March   and the steps taken to implement it  which occurred after   March   constituted the relevant injury and or alteration to prejudice  A reason  the pre   March   requirement  for the respondent s impugned conduct is said to be that the pilots were entitled to the benefit of the enterprise bargaining agreement  para    Although para   covers conduct occurring both before and after   March   para  A pleads that  in the premises  the respondent has contravened s  K  Paragraph  B then pleads  in the alternative  that the sole or dominant reason  the post   March   requirement  for the respondent s impugned conduct was that the pilots had the benefit of the enterprise bargaining agreement  Paragraph  C pleads that  in the premises  the respondent has  since   March   contravened s   of the amended Act   The respondent complains that  by pleading its case in this way  the applicant has merged the separate causes of action provided for in ss  K and   thereby creating confusion such that the respondent is unable to comprehend the case it is called upon to meet or plead to it   The applicant sought to meet these objections by pointing to the amendment to para  B which now includes a reference to the  implementation  of the decision  Most of the steps which it is said were taken as part of the implementation process were alleged to have occurred prior to   March    The steps relied on by counsel for the applicant which occurred at this time were      The respondent s decision that Jetstar would upgrade its air operator certificate so it could operate wide bodied long haul aircraft  para       The negotiations in December   and   with the Jetstar pilots  counsel to introduce terms and conditions of employment which would apply to Jetstar pilots involved in long haul flying  para       The respondent s refusal to permit the applicant to participate in those negotiations  para       The respondent s refusal  on or about   February   to entertain negotiations with the applicant for alternative terms and conditions of employment upon which the Airbus fleet pilots would carry out the work on the four aircraft allocated to Jetstar  para  A     The variation  on or about   March   of the Jetstar agreement as a consequence of agreement reached in negotiations  paras   and     The steps taken after   March   which are relied on were the transfer of the three aircraft in October and November   paras  I   J and  K
