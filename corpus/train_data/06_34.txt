Tu v Pakway Australia Pty Ltd  ACN    T AS Pakway Plastics    FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toWillis Tu v Pakway Australia Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  This is a design case in which the applicants claimed injunctive relief and damages for infringement of the first applicant s registered designs in respect of plates or  at the first applicant s option  an account of profits in respect of the infringement of its designs  On   September   I published reasons for judgment on liability  Willis Tu v Pakway Australia Pty Ltd   FCA     Willis Tu    I found that the first and second respondents had infringed the registered designs  The applicants elected to have an account of profits and  by agreement  the parties subsequently settled on   as the amount of profit  The parties were  however  unable to agree on costs and have filed submissions concerning a number of costs questions  The question of costs now falls for determination   The respondents concede that the applicants are entitled to a general order for costs in their favour  However  they submit that they are entitled to costs that were reserved in connection with the application for an interlocutory injunction and the notice of motion filed on   February    The respondents also claim that the applicants should not recover costs relating to affidavits of Robin Walton  the evidence of Peter Kingsley Bayly  and the retention of two counsel for trial   The applicants submit that there is no reason to depart from  or modify  the application of the general rule that costs follow the event  Moreover  they submit that the Court should order that costs not be reduced by one third pursuant to O   r  A  of the Federal Court Rules    Cth   the Rules    The affidavits of Robin Walton and the evidence of Peter Bayly  to the extent admissible  did not much advance the applicants  case  see Willis Tu at    Nevertheless  Mr Bayly s evidence assisted the Court in identifying the significant features of the registered designs  see Willis Tu at      In the circumstances of the case  I do not find the applicants  reliance on his evidence as so unreasonable as to justify denying him the costs of this evidence  Similarly  I would not disallow the applicants the costs of Mr Walton s affidavits simply because these affidavits included some unnecessary technical details and the applicants did not succeed on the issues to which they were directed   Accordingly  the applicants should recover the costs relating to the affidavits of Mr Walton and the evidence of Mr Bayly   Finally  the respondents contended that the applicants should not recover the costs of retaining senior and junior counsel  This is an issue that
