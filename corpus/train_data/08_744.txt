the RRT was not able to be satisfied that the applicant met the s   criteria for the grant of a protection visa  Therefore it had no option but to refuse to grant him such a visa  SJSB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at      The Minister added that to the extent that this ground was intended to allege a failure by the RRT to comply with one or more of its statutory obligations under Div   of Pt   of the Act  s  B of which provides represents an exhaustive statement of the natural justice hearing rule  the RRT had complied with those obligations  including those pursuant to ss   and  A of the Act    Ground   is in the following terms   That the decision of the RRT says that the applicant satisfies the criterion for refugee visain  sic  conclusion of the statement of decision  the RRT remitted back the case to the department  After a few weeks times the appellant was notified by another decision which is quite different to the decision made on   which really requires the judicial inference  sic  of this honourable Court to meet the ends of justice   The Minister submitted that no arguable jurisdictional error arose by reason of the fact that the RRT s decision record  as initially sent to the applicant on   October   contained a clerical error  and the Federal Magistrate was correct in so finding   The Minister further submitted that the RRT s obligation to send the applicant a copy of the decision was not one which could impact upon the validity of the decision itself  That was because the decision had already been made consideredSZFLM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In SZFLM v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA

appellant a complete copy of its reasons for decision  in breach of s  B  of the Act   amounted to a reviewable error  The copy of the decision sent to the appellant was missing page five  which set

consideredForoghi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The authorities dealing with errors of a typographical nature are also relevant  In particular  the Minister drew my attention to the observations of Marshall J in Foroghi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   where his Honour stated  at    Occasionally the RRT  like other decision makers  delivers reasons for decision without   proof reading  Occasionally mistakes are not discovered even when the best proof readers have examined draft reasons  The existence of typographical error is best acknowledged rather than attempted to be exploited  see CCC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA     In Foroghi   the RRT wrongly referred to the applicant  rather than another person  as being dead  In CCC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA     a judgment also delivered by Marshall J  the RRT had

not  prior to the word  satisfied  in the sentence quoted above   These observations are relevant to the present application  No arguable jurisdictional error arose out of the clerical error which the RRT made  That error was not capable of affecting the exercise of its jurisdiction   Ground   is in the following terms   That the Respondents have failed to assess the claims made by the appellant as per the refugee law as laid down by the hand book of the UNHCR  The real threat to the life of the Appellant was not considered in the instant case
