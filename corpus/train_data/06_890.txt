Rana v Australian Federal Police   FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toChu v Telstra Corporation Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  I pause at this point to note that the condition in s  A a  is not expressed in terms of the agency or Minister being satisfied that reasonable steps have been taken  and that raises a question as to whether the condition involves a jurisdictional fact  That question was addressed by Finn J in Chu v Telstra Corporation Ltd   FCA         FCR   and  for the reasons his Honour gives  with which I respectfully agree  the judgment as to the requirement in s  A a  is for the agency or Minister in question and  upon review  for the Tribunal  and not ultimately for the Court   Under s   of the FIO Act  the applicant sought a review of the decision by the Tribunal  As I have said  the Tribunal affirmed the decision under review   On   August   the applicant limited his application to the Tribunal to his request for documents said to have been provided by him to the respondent in    His description of the documents is as follows         documents  that  were given to me by the Queensland Police after I had complained to the Fitzgerald Inquiry  Australian Federal Police wanted to know about my involvement with Operation Maitita an undercover role that I had played to trap some members of the Ananda Marga sect implicated allegedly in the   Hilton Hotel bombings in Sydney        Documents referred toMcLeod v Australian Securities and Investment Commission   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  As to the second submission  this could be rejected on a number of grounds  It is sufficient for me to say that the State Act does not apply to the applicant s request for access according to its terms and is not  picked up  by s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth  because the Commonwealth has  otherwise provided  in the FIO Act  see McLeod v Australian Securities and Investment Commission   HCA         CLR   at        The application must be dismissed and the applicant must pay the respondent s costs     I certify that the preceding

application under the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act    Cth   the ADJR Act   It seems that the applicant had a right of appeal on a question of law from the decision of the Tribunal under s   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth   the AAT Act  but he has not exercised that right  Although the respondent accepts that the decision falls within the terms of the ADJR Act  see  eg  Pancontinental Mining Ltd v Burns     FCR   at     per von Doussa J  it submits that because the applicant had a right of appeal on a question of law under the AAT Act  I have a discretion not to entertain the application under the ADJR Act  However  the respondent has asked me not to exercise the discretion to decline to entertain the application  because it submits that it is in the interests of justice that the application be determined as expeditiously as possible  I am prepared to proceed in this way because  irrespective of the form of the challenge  the applicant must show a breach of the rules of natural justice or an error of law and I am satisfied that he is unable to do this   The applicant represented himself both in this Court and in the Tribunal  He believes that the respondent has certain documents and  as will become clear  his attempts to obtain those documents have a long history   On   February   the applicant made a request of the respondent under s   of the FIO Act for certain documents  The documents sought were as follows     Seeking freedom of information between   to   about myself     I seek all materials and including a Queensland Police file  including the Special Branch files  that I provided you in    referred toSullivan v Department of Transport     ALR   Section  b  of the AAT Act provides that a proceeding before the Tribunal shall be conducted with as little formality and technicality  and with as much expedition  as the requirements of that Act and of every other relevant enactment and a proper consideration of the matters before the Tribunal permit  The Tribunal has a duty to act judicially  Ordinarily  it is for the parties to define the issues in the proceedings and to decide how they wish to conduct their respective cases  As Deane J  with whom Fisher J agreed  noted in Sullivan v Department of Transport     ALR    at   undue interference by the Tribunal with how the parties conduct their cases may prove counter productive  At the same time  there may be cases where the Tribunal s duty to act judicially may require it to advise a party of his or her ability to seek an adjournment  or even to adjourn a hearing of its own motion  It is not possible to catalogue the circumstances in which either of these courses may be appropriate  They are likely to be rare and to involve a party who does not have legal representation   In this case  the applicant was aware before the hearing that the respondent was asserting that the documents could not be found or did not exist  There is nothing in what occurred before the Tribunal to suggest that it would have been appropriate for the Tribunal to intervene in some way so as to enable the applicant to launch what is even now an unparticularised challenge to the evidence of the searches conducted of the electronic databases of the respondent  I reject the first submission
