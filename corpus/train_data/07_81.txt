Hem  in the matter of Coulco Trading Pty Ltd  Subjectto Deed of Company Arrangement  v Cant  Administrator of the Deed of Company Arrangement of Coulco Trading Pty Ltd  Subjectto Deed of Company Arrangement    FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedBassett v French   NY St Rep     The principle I intend to apply is that if a plaintiff earns any money which he is not able to collect  he is not to be charged with that money  I have not been able to find any Anglo Australian authority on point but I did come across a decision of the New York Court of Common Pleas that is in point  The case is Bassett v French   NY St Rep      The action was for damages for wrongful dismissal  As regards the assessment of damages Pryor J said of the plaintiff     He was bound only to reasonable diligence in quest of other employment  and the proof is that he fulfilled the obligation  Having credited the defendant with every dollar he actually received  he is not responsible for money he earned but could not collect    citations omitted  Although consultancy fees were credited to Mr Hem s account in the books of SSSA  the fees were not paid  the company is no longer in business  and it is unlikely to have assets to discharge the debt  At least Mr Cant  on whom the onus falls  has not shown otherwise  Thus  there will therefore be no deduction from the claim   The appeal will be allowed and Mr Cant will be directed to admit Mr Hem s proof for    On the question of costs  I think that Mr Hem should have them on a solicitor and client basis save for the costs incurred on   October    Not only was Mr Hem successful on the appeal  on the evidence available to Mr Cant he had no basis for rejecting the proof  I have excluded the costs of   October   because they were incurred when Mr Hem applied for and was granted leave to reopen his case and tender additional evidence  The costs of that day  also on a solicitor and client basis  should be borne

destroy or seriously damage the relationship of confidence and trust between employer and employee  An intention to repudiate need not be proved  Rather  it is a matter of objectively looking at the

Thomson v Orica Australia Pty Ltd     IR    In that case Allsop J described constructive dismissal in the following terms     Constructive dismissal is an unlawful termination of the contract of employment in circumstances where the employee leaves  without an express act or enunciation of  dismissal  by the employer  It will be taken to be a dismissal  hence the word  constructive  if the employer has behaved towards the employee in a way that entitles the employee to treat the employment as at an end  How that behaviour of the employer is to be described is at the heart of the matter  One difficulty in a simple enunciation of the common law principle is the existence of legislation and caselaw on closely related topics  However  if one is to approach the matter in straightforward contractual terms there is ample authority for the implication of a term in a contract of employment that the employer will not  without reasonable cause  conduct itself in a manner likely to damage or destroy the relationship of confidence and trust between the parties as employer and employee    citations omitted     Allsop J went on to state that   Breach of that implied term will entitle the employee to treat himself or herself as wrongfully dismissed    He cited with approval the judgments of Olsson J in Blaikie v South Australian Superannuation Board and in Easling v Mahoney Insurance

principles  there are several instances where a single incident of verbal abuse has given rise to a successful claim for constructive dismissal  So  in Isle of Wight Tourist Board v Coombes   IRLR   a director said of his secretary   She is an intolerable bitch on a Monday morning  leading Bristow J to find there had been a constructive dismissal  In Courtaulds Northern Textiles Ltd v Anderson

ICR   an employee who was falsely accused of theft was found to have been  constructively dismissed   Likewise in Moores v Bude Stratton Town Council   IRLR   where an employee was called   a lying toe rag  followedSheffield Oxford Controls Co Ltd   ICR   I do not discount the possibility that Mr Coulson asked Mr Hem to resign  I rather think that something along those lines was suggested  Having accused him of theft it would not be surprising had Mr Coulson asked Mr Hem to resign  By the time of the conversation the ill will between the two was significant  If Mr Hem had been asked to resign to avoid a dismissal that would be equivalent to an actual dismissal  In Sheffield Oxford Controls Co Ltd   ICR   in delivering the judgment of the Employment Appeal Tribunal  Arnold J said  at        It is plain  we think  that there must exist a principle  exemplified by the four cases to which we have referred  that where an employee resigns and that resignation is determined upon him because he prefers to resign rather than be dismissed  the alternative having been expressed to him by the employer in the terms of a threat that if he does not resign he will be dismissed  the mechanics of the resignation do not cause that to be other than a dismissal  The cases do not in terms go further than that  We find the principle to be one of causation  In cases such as that which we have just hypothesised  and those reported  the causation is the threat  It is the existence of the threat which causes the employee to be willing to sign  and to sign  a resignation letter or be willing to give  and to give  the oral resignation  But where that willingness is brought about by other considerations and the actual causation of the resignation is no longer the threat which has been made but is the state of mind of the resigning employee  that he is willing and content to resign on the terms which he has negotiated and which are satisfactory to him  then we think there is no room for the principle to be derived from the decided cases   In the end it is not necessary for me to rule on any of the disputed aspects of the conversation between Mr Hem and Mr Coulson  The reason is that it is not in dispute that during the discussion Mr Hem was accused of being a thief  In the absence of any justification  and none was proffered  that accusation constitutes what in some cases is referred to as a  constructive dismissal  appliedThomson v Orica Australia Pty Ltd     IR   The second case is Thomson v Orica Australia Pty Ltd     IR    In that case Allsop J described constructive dismissal in the following terms     Constructive dismissal is an unlawful termination of the contract of employment in circumstances where the employee leaves  without an express act or

with approval the judgments of Olsson J in Blaikie v South Australian Superannuation Board and in Easling v Mahoney Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd which he said   expressed the principle with clarity
