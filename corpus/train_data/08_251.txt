  CLR     if an administrative tribunal  like the Tribunal         falls into an error of law which causes it to identify a wrong issue  to ask itself a wrong question  to ignore relevant material  to

circumstances of a particular case may permit more than one characterisation of the error identified  for example  as the decision maker both asking the wrong question and ignoring relevant material  What is important  however  is that identifying a wrong issue  asking a wrong question  ignoring relevant material or relying on irrelevant material in a way that affects the exercise of power is to make an error of law  Further  doing so results in the decision maker exceeding the authority or powers given by the relevant statute  In other words  if an error of those types is made  the decision maker did not have authority to make the decision that was made  he or she did not have jurisdiction to make it  Nothing in the Act suggests that the Tribunal is given authority to authoritatively

a discretion of an administrative tribunal  As pointed out by Mason J in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     The limited role of a court reviewing the exercise of an administrative discretion must constantly be borne in mind  It is not the function of the court to substitute its own decision for that of the administrator by exercising a discretion which the legislature has vested in the administrator  Its role is to set limits on the exercise of that discretion  and a decision made within those boundaries cannot be impugned      cf Gyles

of fact  cf Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR     In this case the Tribunal clearly gave proper  genuine and realistic consideration to the best interests

 in the absence of particulars it is not clear  this ground of review goes to the facts of the applicant s case before the Tribunal  and possibly the weight ascribed by the Tribunal to various factors in the course of its decision making  For the reasons outlined in respect of Ground   it is not a competent ground of review in this Court   As a general proposition it is important that a decision maker has before it the best evidence on which to base a decision  The Tribunal is empowered by legislation to inform itself on any matter in such a manner as it thinks appropriate  and is not bound

Workplace Relations   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  First  it is possible that the relevant material could have assisted the applicant in his case before the Tribunal  However  as Gray J observed succinctly in Pham v Secretary Department of Employment and Workplace Relations   FCA   at     the Tribunal is empowered to make its own decision on whatever material is before it at the time when it makes that decision   Second  if the applicant had required further time to adduce evidence before the Tribunal  he should have sought an adjournment of his hearing before the Tribunal  In circumstances where a party before the Tribunal requires an adjournment in order to adduce evidence necessary to the conduct of its case  it is appropriate that the Tribunal entertain and give proper consideration to such an application  In this case  however  it does not appear that the applicant made an application for an adjournment   I note that the applicant was not represented before the Tribunal  It is clear that it can be a daunting prospect for an applicant to represent himself in such circumstances  and his entitlement to seek an adjournment of the proceedings may not be apparent  However it does not appear that  at the Tribunal hearing  the applicant pressed his need for this unavailable material  or explained to the Tribunal why it was necessary to its decision   Third  from his submissions at the hearing before me  it appears that  although the applicant had written to the Tribunal Member s associate to inform the Tribunal Member of the issue prior to the hearing  his indications to the Tribunal as to the importance of this material at the actual Tribunal hearing were equivocal  TS p   ll      As I noted earlier  the Tribunal is empowered by s  A  AAT Act to obtain necessary information by compulsion if necessary  If the applicant had made known to the Tribunal the importance of the relevant information  it is possible that he could have made an application to the Tribunal for the information to be made available  In this case  however  he clearly did not   Fourth  in this case it is clear that the Tribunal had explained to the applicant approximately one month before the hearing that he needed to prepare for the Tribunal hearing  The Tribunal member at     observed  in relation to the applicant s statement at the Tribunal hearing      Consequently  his statement had been rather brief  It should be noted  however  that at the telephone directions hearing on   June   I had stressed to Mr Rountree the importance of ensuring that all his witness statements were filed and served on time  and at the very latest in time to allow two clear business days to elapse before the first day set down for the hearing  otherwise the tribunal could not have regard to any document or information that he might seek to present in support of his case  pursuant to ss  H  and  J  of the Act  I also pointed out that the statement or statements could be handwritten and need not be in any particular form  what was essential was that he gave notice of the matters on which he intended to rely  The applicant thus had ample time to attend to the matter     At the hearing I pointed out to the applicant  however  that he was free to rely on any information that he had previously supplied to the respondent  such as earlier written statements in the G documents  without infringing ss  H  or  J    I note that  although the applicant claims that he was unable to put material favourable to him before the Tribunal  there appeared nothing to prevent him from adducing evidence from his partner  her children  or other supporters in time for the Tribunal hearing   Finally  although the applicant sought to obtain material in the nature of prison reports in order to present what he describes as  a more balanced view  of his character to the Tribunal  from the applicant s description this material seems  at most  relevant to the issue of his recidivism  In this respect  however  it appears from the Tribunal s decision that there was already a considerable amount of information before the Tribunal in relation to the risk of recidivism to which the Tribunal had regard  at      The Tribunal clearly took into consideration information favourable to the applicant  including his progress towards rehabilitation  his recovery from alcohol addition  and his commitment to his partner and her children  at    I also note that the Tribunal was at pains  as demonstrated at     of the Reasons for Decision which I have set out earlier in this judgment  to acknowledge and consider the applicant s case  including his version of previous events relevant to his application  However the Tribunal was persuaded by other relevant factors detailed in the Reasons for Decision that the applicant was at low medium risk of recidivism citedPlaintiff S  v The Commonwealth of Australia     CLR   Nonetheless if the applicant s visa has been cancelled on the basis of a decision infected by jurisdictional error  the Court has jurisdiction to consider an application to have the decision quashed  Plaintiff S  v The Commonwealth of Australia     CLR     In this case the applicant has not framed his application in terms of judicial review of the Tribunal s decision  or sought to have that decision quashed pursuant to s  B Judiciary Act    Cth   However at the hearing the applicant applied for leave to have the errors of law raised in his draft notice of appeal deemed to be grounds for review  This application for leave was not opposed by the Minister and leave was granted   The Tribunal identified the two issues in the application before it as     Whether the applicant did not pass the character test in s  a  because of his past and present criminal conduct and  if so     Whether the Tribunal should exercise its discretion to set aside or affirm the decision made by the delegate of the Minister to cancel the applicant s visa   The background facts as found by the Tribunal may be summarised as follows    The applicant was born in New Zealand in   and first arrived in Australia in    In New Zealand the applicant had accumulated a substantial criminal record  In all  he was sentenced to over   years imprisonment in New Zealand  not including sentences which were served concurrently     On arrival in Australia the applicant was granted a special category visa class TY subclass    He did not  however  satisfy the requirements for an absorbed person visa under s   Migration Act      His lengthy New South Wales criminal history commenced on   November    On three separate occasions he has been sentenced to terms of imprisonment of   months or more  Nine of his more serious custodial sentences were confirmed on appeal and none appear to have been reversed or reduced     On   June   the applicant was convicted at Coffs Harbour District Court of the offence supplying a prohibited drug in an indictable quantity  not cannabis  for which he was sentenced to three years imprisonment with a non parole period of   months  At the same time he was convicted of two counts of possessing a prohibited drug for which he was sentenced to six months imprisonment  to be served concurrently     On   February   the applicant was notified of the Minister s intention to consider cancelling the applicant s visa under s   Migration Act   After considering the applicant s response  the delegate of the Minister made the decision to cancel the applicant s visa on   May     The Tribunal noted that  at the hearing before it  the applicant had had no access to writing material at the Brisbane City Watchhouse  and that he had had little time to prepare a statement for transmission to the Tribunal and the respondent  However the Tribunal also noted that at earlier telephone directions the applicant had been informed of the importance of ensuring that all witness statements were filed and served on time  at     The Tribunal observed that under s   Migration Act   the Minister may cancel a visa if the holder does not satisfy the Minister that the person passes the character test  s  a  and  b   It is clear that the Minister retains a discretion as to whether the relevant visa should be cancelled   Section   provides that a person does not pass the character test if  inter alia      a  the person has a substantial criminal record  as defined by subsection   or        c  having regard to either or both of the following         i  the person s past and present criminal conduct   ii  the person s past and present general conduct  the person is not of good character  orrelatedRountree and Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   AATA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth aat  html  On   May   the applicant s visa was cancelled on character grounds by a delegate of the Minister under s   Migration Act   The applicant applied to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  the Tribunal  to review that decision  The Tribunal affirmed the decision of the Minister s delegate   Rountree and Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   AATA     The applicant has now filed an application for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal from a decision of the Tribunal and a draft notice of appeal from a decision of the Tribunal   At the hearing before me the applicant was present

exercise its discretion not to cancel the applicant s visa under s     and in light of Pt   of Direction No    The Tribunal noted that para     of Direction No   provided that a decision maker should have regard to three primary considerations as set out in para     as well as a number of other considerations  for example  para      In summary  the Tribunal made the following findings    In considering the first primary consideration  namely the need to protect the Australian community  the Tribunal took into account the nature of the Coffs Harbour offence  as well as several prior separate occasions when the applicant had received custodial terms of   months and several other shorter sentences of imprisonment for breaches of apprehended violence orders  at    The Tribunal considered that there was a low to medium risk of recidivism in light of  inter alia   the applicant s  particularly long and sustained criminal record  both in Australia and New Zealand   at       In considering the second primary consideration  namely the expectations of the Australian community  the Tribunal found that the community would expect that the visa of a person with such a sustained and serious record of criminal activity while in Australia should be cancelled  but at the same time it would be expected that the interests of the three children involved would be carefully considered     In considering the third primary consideration  namely the best interests of the child  the Tribunal identified as relevant the decisions of the Full Court in Wan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR   and Vaitaiki v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALR    The Tribunal considered the evidence before it and observed that      o
