Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Jeans  in the matterof Jeans   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedLing v Enrobook Pty Limited     FCR   The prejudice to the bank of not my making a sequestration order today is that it may be affected by a dissipation of assets by the debtor after today including a dissipation in the pursuit of the litigation against Mr Cleary  I have been referred to the decision of the Full Court of this court in Ling v Enrobook Pty Limited     FCR   and in particular the court s statement of the test to be applied for the purposes of determining whether  pursuant to s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  I could be satisfied by the debtor that  for other sufficient cause a sequestration order ought not to be made  and that therefore I might in my discretion dismiss the petition  The court said   FCR at  D E     The authorities also show that satisfaction that the debtor is well advanced with litigation likely to result in the debtor being in a position to pay his or her debts may well provide a basis for a finding that there is a   sufficient cause   for a sequestration order not to be made  see  for example  Maddestra v Penfolds Wines Pty Ltd     FCR      But the authorities do not suggest that it is in the public interest to allow insolvent debtors to prosecute litigation generally  They only recognise that it is not in the public interest for a debtor to be forced into bankruptcy by reason of a state of insolvency likely to be of only short duration  Mr Ireland QC  who appears for the debtor  has asked for an adjournment to permit  if it is at all possible  that the consideration of whether sufficient cause has been made out occur once the outcome of the Supreme Court proceedings is known  Mr Bell points out that if the petition remains undetermined prior to its expiry on   July   the bank will lose the benefit of any relation back period based on the occurrence of the act of bankruptcy which founds the petition  If I were to grant an adjournment there would be a very tight time frame within which  ultimately  a Supreme Court judge would have to give a reasoned final judgment  if that were to happen prior to the expiry date of the petition   On the other hand if I were to refuse to grant an adjournment of the petition  a case which clearly has a triable issue as found by the Court of Appeal  and which has a number of very difficult factual and legal issues may never be able to be determined since the overwhelming quantum of the debtor s creditors consist of the bank by reason of the size of the judgment debt
