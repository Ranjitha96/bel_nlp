www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlI do not apprehend any error on the part of the Federal Magistrates Court in failing to find that such procedural fairness as is required by s  A was not given to the appellant  In SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA         ALJR   at para   the High Court remarked of s  a    The use of the future conditional tense  would be  rather than the indicative  strongly suggests that the operation of section  a  is to be determined in advance and independently of the tribunal s particular reasoning on the facts of the case  What I have already observed in relation to s  A is sufficient in the context of the present case to dispose of ground   of the notice of appeal  There was  in the circumstances  no obligation which arose under that section on the part of the Tribunal to give particulars in respect of the coincidence of lodgement of visa applications  There was no particularisation in the notice of appeal or oral submissions of what might otherwise constitute the adverse information  It is to be remembered  having regard to what was observed in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA         ALJR   at para   that the Tribunal s subjective appraisals  thought processes  or determinations  do not constitute  information  for the purposes of s  A appliedSZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe Tribunal is required to give accurate particulars of adverse information to the applicant  Its failure to do so is jurisdictional error  see SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  The Appellant s application for a protection visa had been grounded upon his claim to fear persecution in India on account of his Christianity  More particularly  the claim was propounded upon his alleging to have preached to Dalits in Trivandrum  and encouraged their conversion thereby violating anti conversion laws  He alleged that he had been arrested and held for three weeks and had been mistreated  He also alleged that he had been again arrested in January   after what he described as the  Muslim dominated  CPI M  had achieved power in Kerala  He claimed that the administration of his church had been told not to admit Muslims into the precinct and that he had been followed around Trivandrum  After the events so related the Appellant had visited Singapore  On his return he stated that he had been arrested and accused of converting Hindus  He further stated that he had been released on payment of one lakh  of Indian Rupees  and that he had been ordered to cease his religious activities  His claim  further  was that he  his brother and his brother in law had subsequently resumed their Christian charitable activities in areas outside Trivandrum  but they had been arrested again in November   and accused of procuring conversions  He further claimed that he  his brother and his brother in law had been threatened with deportation to Pakistan and ordered to cease all of their religious activities  It was on the strength of these claims that upon arrival in Australia the Appellant advanced his application for a protection visa  Quite how the case SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   referred to in ground   was relevant was not developed in the Appellant s written or oral submissions  I have considered that case  which I note was decided on   March    Its relevance to ground   is not immediately apparent  All in all  this is just one of those cases where the Tribunal reached views concerning the claim made for a visa  based upon an assessment of the Appellant s credibility  Having considered the Tribunal s reasons  there is nothing remarkable in the Federal Magistrates Court s conclusion that the Tribunal was entitled to reach the views that it did  Findings of credit  providing they are not indicative of illogicality  are matters   par excellence  for the Tribunal  It follows that the appeal must be dismissed   I certify that the preceding twenty three   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Logan

htmlconsideredSZKLK v Minister for Immigration   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThere was also advanced  in the course of oral submissions for the Appellant  the argument that the Federal Magistrates Court and it seems also the Tribunal  were in some way biased  There is not a scintilla of evidence which would support an apprehended bias challenge to the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court  In particular  the fact that that court gave its reasons for judgment upon the day on which the judicial review application was heard  does not support such a finding  As for the Tribunal proceeding  there was not developed before me any argument that the hearing before the Tribunal  in terms of the procedures adopted by the Tribunal  and having regard to its reasons  was such as would give rise to an apprehension of bias of the kind that I found present in SZKLK v Minister for Immigration   FCA   citedSZLPJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThis acknowledged  it is permissible  in my opinion  to draw an inference that  even prospectively  the adverse contingency  which generated on the part of the first Tribunal  the letter of   July   did not form part of the second Tribunal s thinking  That inference  to me  seems to be open from para   of the Tribunal s reasons  I note that in SZLPJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     Perram J adopted a similar approach  see especially para   of his Honour s reasons for judgment
