Forbes Engineering  Asia  Pte Limited v Forbes  No     FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedDeangrove Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The effect of this rule in my view is that a party must specifically obtain the leave of the Court to withdraw an admission to which O   r   applies  In this case no such specific leave has been obtained by the respondents  Mr Perran SC relies on the decision of Sackville J in Deangrove Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia   FCA   as authority that no leave ought be granted to withdraw admissions in this case  The primary complaint of the applicants in this context relates to paras   and   of the second further amended defence   On a simple comparison of the two versions of paras   and   it appears clear that the respondent has  in amending its defence  withdrawn a number of admissions  The relevant paragraphs are as follows    Paragraphs   and   in the further amended defence filed by the respondent on   September          With respect to paragraph   of the amended statement of claim the respondents         a  admit that the first respondent and the first applicant agreed as to the amount of the Agreed   Profit Shortfall Amount   as defined in the amended statement of claim     b  deny that the second respondent agreed to the Agreed   Profit Shortfall Amount on the basis that the second respondent was not present during discussions about the Agreed   Profit Shortfall Amount   c  admit that the conversation particularised in paragraph  a  took place   d  admit the existence of the letter particularised in paragraph  b    but object thereto on the basis that the letter is not a material fact relevant to the alleged agreement            With respect to paragraph   of the amended statement of claim the respondents         a  admit the Agreed   Profit Shortfall Amount appeared in the books of account of Forbes Australia as a prepayment of rent payable under the Lot   Lease   b  deny that Agreed   Profit Shortfall Amount represented a true entry in the books of account of Forbes Australia on the basis no shortfall existed despite the matters set out herein such that no amount was truly owing pursuant to the agreement referred to therein         c  further and alternatively           i  repeat the rely on the matters pleaded in paragraphs  C and  D herein     ii  plead that  in the premises  no obligation arose under the Forbes Guarantee or under the Forbes   Lease Guarantee  as alleged or at all          Paragraphs   and   in the second further amended further amended defence filed   October          With respect to paragraph   of the amended statement of claim the respondents         a  deny that there was any agreement as to the   profit shortfall  pursuant to the Forbes Guarantee and the Forbes Lot   Lease Guarantee  as those agreements did not provide for calculation of  or agreement to  any profit shortfall for the   calendar year or otherwise  admit that the first respondent and the first applicant agreed as to the amount of the Agreed   Profit Shortfall Amount  as defined in the amended statement of claim     b  deny that the second respondent agreed to the Agreed   Profit Shortfall Amount on the basis that the second respondent was not present during discussions about the Agreed   Profit Shortfall Amount   c  admit that the conversation particularised in paragraph  a  took place   but plead that any such agreement as alleged therein is to be set aside because             i  the first applicant caused the amount of the sales of Forbes Australia in the   calendar year to be reduced by approximately   by the issue of  credit notes  which ought to have been recorded as sales by Forbes Australia for the   calendar year  or included by way adjustment to the profit result for the   calendar year     ii  the first applicant knew  or ought to have known  of the matters pleaded in subparagraph  i  above     iii  by reason of the first respondent s agreement in the course of the conversation that the amount of the shortfall of the Profit Guarantee for the   calendar year was     when in truth and in fact there was no shortfall of the Profit Guarantee for the   calendar year  the first applicant knew  or ought to have known  that the first applicant was unaware of the matters pleaded in subparagraph  i  above     iv  in the premises  it would be unconscionable to permit any agreement to create any liability in respect of the alleged  and non existent    profit shortfall           v  further and alternatively     A  Forbes Australia failed  in contravention of s   of the Corporations Law and  subsequently  s   of the Corporations Act   properly and adequately to maintain its financial records for the   calendar year       B  accordingly  the respondents have been denied any proper opportunity to assess        the validity and accuracy of any accounts of Forbes Australia for the   calendar year  or       the full amount of the sales made by Forbes Australia for the   calendar year       C  the present proceeding is  accordingly  an abuse of process         d  admit the existence of the letter particularised in paragraph  b  but object thereto on the basis that the letter is not a material fact relevant to the alleged agreement           With respect to paragraph   of the amended statement of claim the respondents         a  do not admit the Agreed   Profit Shortfall Amount appeared in the books of account of Forbes Australia as a prepayment of rent payable under the Lot   Lease   because             i  Forbes Australia failed  in contravention of s   of the Corporations Law and  subsequently  s   of the Corporations Act   properly and adequately to maintain its financial records for the   calendar year     ii  accordingly  the respondents have been denied any proper opportunity to assess whether or not the alleged entry was a proper entry in Forbes Australia s book of accounts             b  deny   in any event  that Agreed   Profit Shortfall Amount represented a true entry in the books of account of Forbes Australia on the basis no shortfall existed despite the matters set out herein such and that   accordingly  no amount was truly owing pursuant to the agreement referred to therein   c  further and alternatively             i  repeat and rely on the matters pleaded in paragraphs  B   C   D   F and   herein   ii  plead that  in the premises  no obligation arose under the Forbes Guarantee or under the Lot   Lease Guarantee  as alleged or at all   The basis of the applicants  complaint is most obviously illustrated by a simple comparison between the two versions of these paragraphs in that  for example  whereas in the further amended defence filed   September   in each of paras  a  and  a  the respondent  admits  the fact contained therein  in the second further amended defence filed   October   in each of paras  a  and  a  the respondent  denies   para  a  or  does not admit   para  a  the relevant facts  Prima facie   this does appear to constitute a withdrawal of admissions relatedForbes Engineering  Asia  Pte Limited v Mark Forbes   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  I note that    One of the reasons I ordered the hearing dates vacated was because I accepted the view taken by the new solicitor for the respondents that  in light of developments following the hearing of   September   a second further amended defence would need to be filed and served   Forbes Engineering  Asia  Pte Limited v Mark Forbes   FCA   at         The orders of   October   which accepted that leave to amend the respondents  further amended defence had been given pursuant to O   r   and directed that a second further amended defence be filed within a short time frame  were made in light of those reasons     I accept the submission of the respondents  and it is not in dispute  that the legal representatives for the applicants had been in possession of a copy of the proposed second further amended defence since the morning of   October   but no objection was made by the legal representatives when I made the relevant orders  including the order of which complaint is now made  on the afternoon of   October     However  notwithstanding the absence of objection by the legal representatives of the applicants on   October   when directions were being given  it is now clear that they had not had a proper opportunity to consider the contents of the proposed second further amended defence  Further  I accept that Mr Jones for the applicants had anticipated that he would have an opportunity at a later date to deal with this proposal and any application for leave to file   In addition to this  the possibility that the second further amended defence contains withdrawals of admissions made in earlier versions of this pleading raises a different issue  Whereas the general position with respect to amendment of pleadings is dealt with in O   r   and O   r   Federal Court Rules specifically deals with withdrawals of admissions  In this case the applicants particularly rely on O   r   which provides    Sub rule   does not enable a party to withdraw  without the consent of another party or the leave of the Court  an admission or any other matter operating for the benefit of that other party
