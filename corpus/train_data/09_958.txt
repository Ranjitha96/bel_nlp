au au cases cth HCA a htmlI see no error on the part of the Federal Magistrate  The High Court s decision in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKTI These reasons were written prior to the decision of the High Court  handed down this morning  to allow the appeal in SZKTI   Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKTI   HCA    The High Court there accepted  at   the Minister s submissions  at     that s   does not operate to limit the general facultative power given by s   in aid of the inquisitorial functions of the Tribunal  The limitation on that general power is that the Tribunal   must have regard   to that information in making its decision  at    Procedural fairness is assured by  inter alia   the requirements of s  A  The High Court concluded  at   that the procedural restrictions on the specific power to issue an invitation to give additional information do not qualify the Tribunal s general power in s   to   get any information that it considers relevant    It follows that the method adopted by the Tribunal to obtain the information did not give rise to jurisdictional error  It follows that the appellant has not demonstrated jurisdictional

and was not independent information  This  he says  was because the people who collected the information are controlled by   the Minister   or   the Minister s officials    There is no evidence to

no evidence that the Tribunal or the High Commission were acting at the dictate of any person in Bangladesh   Randhawa v Minister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethnic Affairs   FCA         FCR   at    No other procedural unfairness is identified by the appellant  Otherwise  this aspect of the appellant s case seems to concern the fact finding by the Tribunal  Other issues The Tribunal did not accept the situation described by the appellant as to the political situation in Bangladesh  The Tribunal accepted that politics in that country has always been accompanied by violence but found that the violence against political opponents has been largely random and lacked the systematic and purposive elements necessary to be called persecution  especially when involving minor figures such

Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         ALD  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlAs to s  R of the Act  the Federal Magistrate observed that whether particular conduct amounts to persecution under s  R is a matter of fact and degree for the Tribunal to determine in its fact finding role   VTAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         ALD   at     and found no jurisdictional error  Accordingly  her Honour rejected the second ground in the application for review  that the Tribunal erred in its application of s  R by failing to consider whether the appellant might suffer persecution as a result of false charges he claimed were filed against him  The grounds of appeal raised by the appellant are  The learned Magistrate erred by not holding that the Tribunal made jurisdictional error as it was not open for the Tribunal to make a finding that  Some of the statement made at hearing regarding the fate of party colleagues have been shown to be incorrect  His errors have been drawn to this attention on the Tribunal s letters but he has not addressed them in his replies  And the conclusion was made from this observation is quietly irrelevant with the observations  The Tribunal did not make comments on the applicant s reply    The learned Magistrate erred by not holding that the Tribunal made jurisdictional error that the Tribunal did not take into account the fear for harm in the future of the applicant for his political opinion  The Tribunal did not put any supporting evidence about its comment on false cases against the applicant because the false cases are investigated improperly and unfairly people are involved to persecute by the Government Agency  The applicant did not know that how the Australian High Commission in Dhaka made an investigation and made a report against the applicant  The investigation was not done properly  In summary  they seem to raise the following bases of appeal The Minister says that these grounds do not relate to the grounds pleaded before the Federal Magistrate  The Minister submits that leave is required to rely on those grounds and opposes leave being granted  as there is no explanation why those grounds were not raised before the Federal Magistrate and as they are unmeritorious  Consideration of the grounds in the notice of appeal  Ground one
