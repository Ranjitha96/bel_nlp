McBain  Trustee  in the matter of Turner  Bankrupt  v Palffy   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toLewis v Doran   NSWSC         FLR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  htmlThe approach to assessing insolvency set out by Palmer J in Lewis v Doran   NSWSC         FLR   at     is particularly instructive  Those paragraphs are set out below  They relate to the Corporations Act    Cth   the Corporations Act   but are applicable to like considerations which arise under the bankruptcy legislation    I think that I must approach the application of s  A  of the Corporations Act   with two considerations in mind  First  the words of s  A must be construed as they stand  without addition or subtraction  Second  the law both before and after the enactment of s  A is unequivocally and emphatically clear that insolvency is  first and last  a question of fact      to be ascertained from a consideration of the company s financial position taken as a whole  In considering the company s financial position as a whole  the Court must have regard to commercial realities  Commercial realities will be relevant in considering what resources are available to the company to meet its liabilities as they fall due  whether resources other than cash are realisable by sale or borrowing upon security  and when such realisations are achievable        Southern Cross Interiors Pty Ltd  in liq  v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   NSWSC         NSWLR   at     NSWSC         FLR    citations of authority omitted         The question of a company s solvency may arise retrospectively or prospectively  The question arises retrospectively where  for example  a liquidator is seeking to recover an unfair preference or to set aside an insolvent transaction so that the issue is solvency as at a date prior to the winding up  The question may arise prospectively where a company is sought to be wound up in insolvency and the company s ability to pay its debts must be determined not only by reference to debts payable as at the date of trial but also by reference to its ability to pay debts which will fall for payment some time in the near future      Where the question is retrospective insolvency  the Court has the inestimable benefit of the wisdom of hindsight  One can see the whole picture  both before  as at and after the alleged date of insolvency  The Court will be able to see whether as at the alleged date of insolvency the company was  or was not  actually paying all of its debts as they fell due and whether it did  or did not  actually pay all those debts which  although not due as at the alleged date of insolvency  nevertheless became due at a time which  as a matter of commercial reality and common sense  had to be considered as at the date of insolvency  By reference to what actually happened  rather than to conflicting experts  opinions as to the implications of balance sheets  the court s task in assessing insolvency as at the alleged date should not be very difficult  Transferring the matters referred to by Palmer J to their current context  the following propositions may be stated  The bankrupt s financial position must be considered as a whole  having regard to commercial realities  Resources available to the bankrupt  whether by cash or realisation of assets or by borrowing upon security  are to be taken into account  With hindsight  the bankrupt s ability to pay his debts as and when they fall due is to be assessed appliedBank of Australasia v Hall   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe cash flow test is not simply an assessment of the bankrupt s debts due and cash available to pay them on one day fixed in time  but involves a forward looking assessment of the bankrupt s ability to pay his debts as and when they fall due in the not distant future  Debts are not simply  debts  then  payable  but   debts  as they become due    a phrase which looks to the future   Griffiths CJ in Bank of Australasia v Hall   HCA         CLR   at    The identification of the bankrupt s contingent and prospective liabilities as at   April   and the extent to which they may be considered as part of his debts  at that time  is a crucial matter for determination  The weight of authority suggests that contingent or prospective liabilities may be included as part of a person s debts provided that there is a real likelihood of them being established followedRe Saebar  Official Receiver v Saebar     FLR  In Re Saebar  Official Receiver v Saebar     FLR     Hoare J was concerned with the predecessor version of s    In that form  the exception currently found in s  b  was found in s  a   The exception provided that the transfer would not be void if the party claiming under the transfer could prove  that the settlor was  at the time of making the settlement  able to pay all his debts without the aid of the property comprised in the settlement   As in the current Act   debt  was defined to include a liability  In that case  the prospective liability at issue was a liability to pay damages for a personal injury  where judgment had not yet been entered  The question before Hoare J was whether a liability extended to contingent and prospective liabilities  His Honour held that a prospective liability should be taken into account in determining  all of the debts  of the settlor if  considering the whole of the circumstances  there is a real likelihood of the prospective liability becoming  in due course  an actual liability  According to Hoare J  prospective liabilities may be ignored if they are  purely speculative and without any real likelihood of being established   at    It should be noted that the test for insolvency at that time was a cash flow test which is the same test required by the current Act and the Corporations Act   Justice Einfeld in Re Finney  Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Finney     ATR   endorsed the decision in Re Cao and also relied on the decisions in Re Saebar and Re Hyams in holding that contingent and prospective liabilities are relevant debts for the exercise of determining solvency pursuant to s   of the Act  At   Einfeld J said   i t is clear law that a prospective liability for a debt should only be disregarded if it is purely speculative and without any real likelihood of being imposed   In White Constructions  ACT  Pty Ltd  In Liq  v White   NSWSC         ACSR     McDougall J distinguished the circumstances of the case before him from those of both Re Saebar and Re Hyams   White Constructions concerned the solvency of a company for the purposes of the Corporations Act and relying on the definition of solvency in s  A of that Act  At   McDougall J said    The decisions in Saebar and Hyams   and the decisions discussed in those cases  recognise that an unestablished  and unquantified  liability may be required to be taken into account for the purposes of the particular exercise propounded by the legislation  They do not show that a claim for unliquidated damages is a debt  let alone a debt that is due and payable  I therefore do not think that the decisions are of direct relevance to the issue of insolvency as it has been framed  I am persuaded  having regard to the above analysis  that the proper view of the authorities on this question is that the principles enunciated in the early  s in Re Saebar and Re Hyams are still good law and should be applied  as they were in Re Finney   What debts  including contingent liabilities

purposes of s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  contingent liabilities should be considered if there was a reasonable possibility that the settlor would have had to meet them at the time  That case dealt with a contingent liability arising from a guarantee and as such it was a liability that could be easily quantified  In any event  Gibbs J did not limit his relevant observations to cases so quantifiable  Justice Einfeld in Re Finney  Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Finney     ATR   endorsed the decision in Re Cao and also relied on the decisions in Re Saebar and Re Hyams in holding that

respondents rely on Box Valley Pty Ltd v Kidd   NSWCA   as an answer to the authorities reviewed above  That judgment dealt with whether a contingent liability arising from a default clause in a forward sales contract before a default notice has been given constitutes a debt for the purposes of s  A of the Corporations Act   The New South Wales Court of Appeal determined that it did not because it was an unliquidated claim for damages that was not yet quantified  At   Bryson JA said   The word  debt  is used in s  A of the Corporations Act without any supporting definition  An entitlement to claim damages for breach of a contractual obligation to sell and deliver goods is not a debt within the ordinary meaning of that word   Section  A of the Corporations Act defines solvency and insolvency in the same terms as ss   and   of the Act  In contrast to the Act  the Corporations Act does not define debt to include liability referred toLaw Society of Tasmania v Turner   TASSC         Tas R  http www austlii edu au au cases tas supreme ct  htmlIt is contended by the applicant that PWB was contractually obliged to refund investors  monies within one month of the investor giving notice of its demand  Justice Crawford  as his Honour then was  made factual findings to this effect in Law Society of Tasmania v Turner   TASSC         Tas R   at     Investors were provided by PWB with a  PWB Mortgage Register Information Sheet  and with a  Mortgage Investment Form  to sign  Though these forms appear to have changed slightly over time  they are  in all relevant respects  the same  The Information Sheet states that the terms of the investment are contained in the Investment Form and the Information Sheet  The Information Sheet contains a term  under the heading  Withdrawals  that  o ne month s notice is required for both partial and total withdrawal of funds   The respondents contend for an interpretation of this term that is both contrary to the finding of Crawford J and contrary to the plain meaning of the document  They submit that  read in conjunction with another section of the Information Sheet which is headed  Loan Advances  and states  l oan advances are interest only and repayable on demand  Capital repayments are accepted subject to notice  one should understand the  Withdrawals  term to refer to the loans made by PWB to borrowers on behalf of the investors  not to funds invested with PWB and repayable by PWB  I do not accept this submission  PWB was liable to investors for the repayment of their monies on one month s notice  Investors had a cause of action for breach of contract against PWB as at April    As at   April   causes of action in breach of trust had accrued in investors  PWB was in a trust relationship with investors in the Fund  PWB was more than an agent  it was a trustee  Investors invested their funds with the Fund  not with a specific borrower  They were  amongst other things  entitled to be informed and kept up to date about the loans in which their money had been invested  PWB engaged in conduct that breached the trust arrangement constituted by the Fund between PWB and the investors  Judgment has not been entered in relation to these claims  but  in accordance with the authorities referred to above  I am satisfied that these claims as at   April   were likely to become debts of the bankrupt  I base this finding on the following  PWB regularly substituted investor funds in defaulting loans without advising clients and without client consent  The bankrupt has conceded as much  Justice Crawford found at   of Law Society of Tasmania v Turner    i n my opinion a competent legal practitioner  paying proper regard to a practitioner s duty to investor clients  would have realised long before November   that the firm s practice of substituting clients  funds into defaulting loans  without the authority of the clients  amounted to a breach of that duty  It is unnecessary to quantify the equitable debts that these breaches of trust gave rise to in light of my finding in relation to the contractual right of investors to their funds  Quantifying the debts of the bankrupt resulting from the breaches of trust is not straightforward  On the evidence  it is in the realm of millions of dollars  Absent the debts of the bankrupt as a result of the breach of contract  I am satisfied the bankrupt would not have had the ability to meet the debts arising from claims in breach of trust  Law Society proceedings On   December   the Law Society of Tasmania applied to the Supreme Court of Tasmania for a declaration that PWB  the firm  was in fiduciary default  proceeding TASC M   of    Mr Turner was not named as a respondent to this action because he was not a partner of the firm at that date  An order was made on   October   that PWB was  in default   The Solicitors Trust paid     into the Court fund subsequent to that order  That amount increased to     by August
