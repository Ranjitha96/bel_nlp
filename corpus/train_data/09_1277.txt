Sino Gold Mining Limited  in the matter of Sino Gold Mining Limited   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedSovereign Life Assurance Company v Dodd     QB  The leading English case of the composition of classes is Sovereign Life Assurance Company v Dodd     QB     Sovereign Life    In that case Bowen LJ said  at   that classes must be defined so as to prevent confiscation and injustice and that a class must be  confined to those persons whose rights are not so dissimilar as to make it impossible for them to consult together with a view to their common interest   This approach has often been cited with approval  I do not see why it is  impossible  for Kingsway and Assif SA  to consult  with all other holders of in the money options with a view to persuading them to vote against the Option Scheme on the ground that the consideration being offered for their options is inadequate because it is not calculated according to the Black Scholes methodology  cf Sovereign Life   above   According to their contention  all holders of in the money options will be underpaid for the same reason  that they are denied the benefit of receiving any consideration for loss of the prospect of an increase in the value of the underlying shares and the corresponding prospective increase in the value of their options  All holders of in the money options have a  common interest  or  community of interest  in considering the merits of this contention  For the above reasons I was not persuaded that the two classes of option holders proposed were inappropriate  It will remain open to Kingsway and Assif SA  and others  to contend on the second court hearing that the Option Scheme should not be approved because it is unfair or oppressive to them

Oi Lin   HKCFA         HKLRD   Lord Millett  at   emphasised that the test was based on similarity or dissimilarity of legal rights against the company  not on similarity or dissimilarity of interest derived otherwise than from such legal rights  His Lordship stated      The question is whether the rights which are to be released or varied under the Scheme or the new rights which the Scheme gives in their place are so different that the Scheme must be treated as a compromise or arrangement with more than one class referred toIn the matter of Opes Prime Stockbroking Limited     ACSR  The court will not ordinarily order that a meeting be convened unless the scheme is of such a nature and cast in such terms that if it receives support from the statutory majority at the meeting  the court would be likely to approve it on the final hearing  F T Eastment   Sons Pty Ltd v Metal Roof Decking Supplies Pty Ltd     ACLR   at   Re Central Pacific Minerals NL   FCA   at     Nonetheless  the court is not bound by the decision of the meeting so that if  for example  the court considered that there had been oppression  it would not approve the Scheme  see  for example  In the matter of Opes Prime Stockbroking Limited   ACSR   at    CONSIDERATION   The Share Scheme Under the proposed Share Scheme  all of Sino Gold s issued ordinary shares not already owned by members of the Eldorado Group will be acquired by Eldorado Pacific  The consideration to be received by the Sino Gold shareholders will be The new Eldorado shares will rank equally with each existing Eldorado shares  In In the matter of Opes Prime Stockbroking Limited     ACSR     Finkelstein J said  at       The application of the relevant test involves a comparison of the rights creditors have in the absence of the scheme and any new rights that are established under the scheme  Re T   N Ltd  No       All ER at    Once those differences are identified the question whether they form separate classes must be assessed with the following factors in mind  First  when creditors are broken up into classes  each class is given power to veto the scheme and that is a process that undermines the basic approach of decision by majority  Nordic Bank Plc v International Harvester Australia Ltd     VR        Second  there is a built in safeguard against majority oppression in that the court is not bound by the decision of the meeting  Thus  it is necessary to ensure that there is no oppression by the minority  Third  practical considerations are relevant  If a judge is too assiduous in identifying classes  it is possible to end up with any number of classes  In the end  schemes of arrangement are propounded in a business context  The judge should adopt a practical business like approach to the issue  as would the creditors if they were to decide the matter referred toRe MIA Group Ltd     ACSR  The holders of the options are treated as  creditors  in the proposal in accordance with the prevalent view  the authorities were reviewed by Barrett J in Re MIA Group Ltd     ACSR   at     a view from which I will not depart  It is proposed that Eldorado Gold Corporation  Eldorado  a corporation incorporated in Canada  will  through its wholly owned subsidiary  Eldorado Pacific Pty Ltd  Eldorado Pacific  acquire all of the shares in and options issued by Sino Gold  Eldorado is a public company limited by shares with its headquarters in Vancouver  it was originally incorporated in Bermuda but was continued and now exists under Canadian law   It is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange  TSX  and the New York Stock Exchange  NYSE   Eldorado shares are traded on the TSX and the NYSE  Two schemes are proposed  a Share Scheme and an Option Scheme  It is proposed that there be one meeting of the shareholders  Share Scheme Meeting  but two meetings of the option holders  Option Scheme Meetings   There are two Option Scheme Meetings because those responsible have divided the option holders into two classes according to whether their options are  in the money  or  out of the money   They are in the money if their exercise price is less than  i  for options with an A  exercise price A    and  ii  for options with a C  exercise price C     The options are out of the money if their exercise price is equal to or greater than  i  for options with an A  exercise price A    and  ii  for options with a C  exercise price C     It is not for this Court  when considering an application under s  b  to express any view as to whether the procedures and processes of the Court or under the Act are sufficient to satisfy the requirements for exemption to be enlivened  see Re Central Pacific Minerals NL   FCA   at   per Emmett J  Re Simeon Wines Ltd   SASC         ACSR   at       per Lander J  Re Permanent Trustee Co Ltd   NSWSC         ACSR   at   per Barrett J  Exclusivity under the Scheme Implementation Deed Eldorado and Sino Gold are parties to a Scheme Implementation Deed dated   August   as amended on   October    SID   Clause   of the SID contains  no talk  and  no shop  provisions  The period during which those provisions operate is from the date of the SID until the earlier of   March    End Date  and the termination of the SID  The  sunset date  is therefore   March    It follows that the maximum overall period is just over seven months  and the period from the first court hearing to that date is close enough to five months  In Re APN News   Media Ltd   FCA         ACSR     I said  at   that I did not regard an overall period of some three and a half months as unreasonably long  In Re MIA Group Ltd     ACSR     Barrett J observed in relation to the Black Scholes methodology  at          its use for pricing purposes  and voting purposes  in the scheme of arrangement context is sufficiently reasonable  at least on a prima facie basis  to allow the proposed scheme in which it plays a part to go forward for optionholders  consideration on the basis proposed       In that case orders were made for the convening of two meetings only  a meeting of members and a meeting of option holders  His Honour noted  at     that the Black Scholes methodology took into account the different expiry dates and strike prices of the various series of options with which he was concerned  and that its use militated against the prescription of different classes  However  his Honour noted that it remained open for any question of unfairness to be raised at the second court hearing as an objection to approval    The class issue in the present case Kingsway is the holder of   in the money options  They are some of a series of   options which expire on   August    Their exercise price was originally C    but  as a result of a consensual amendment  was reduced by  c to C     Assif SA holds options in the same series  For all I know  it may hold the remaining   options in the series  In correspondence  Kingsway and Assif SA contended that in the money options should be valued  not according to the intrinsic value methodology  but according to the Black Scholes methodology so that their holders would enjoy the benefit of the prospect of an increase in the value of Sino Gold shares down to the expiry date of the options    August    Finally  in Re MIA Group Ltd   above  Barrett J stated  at       In the present case  consistent and indiscriminate application of the same pricing or valuation methodology to options having different characteristics in terms of exercise price and expiry  being a methodology that has regard to value criteria in one market at one time  should lay to rest any argument that those different characteristics so destroy community of interest as to indicate different classes  The matter is  to my mind  sufficiently clear to make it appropriate that a single meeting of all optionholders be convened on the basis that separate classes do not exist  Any contrary view can be agitated in due course should anyone see fit to raise it  Barrett J s reference to  consistent and indiscriminate application of the same pricing or valuation methodology  is reflected in the classes that have been adopted in the present Option Scheme  the intrinsic value methodology has been applied to all in the money options  while the Black Scholes methodology has been applied to all out of the money options  Accordingly  it is appropriate to describe the proposed in the money class as the intrinsic value methodology class  and the proposed out of the money class as the Black Scholes methodology class citedRe Solution   Holdings Ltd     ACSR  Grant Samuel has expressed the opinion that the valuation methodology adopted for the in the money options is fair and reasonable  the Grant Samuel report is annexure A to the Scheme Booklet   An  intrinsic  valuation method formed the basis of the scheme that was approved in Re Solution   Holdings Ltd     ACSR    Jacobson J described the calculation at    As noted earlier  out of the money options are those that have a strike price at or above A     or C     The view could be taken that they have no value  However  because the underlying shares will continue to trade in the future  there is the possibility that their value will increase by the expiry date for those options  so that the options will become  in the money  options with an intrinsic value after all  So long as they remain unexercised  the options may fluctuate between being in the money and out of the money  The extent to which this is likely to occur depends on the volatility of the market for the underlying shares  the level of the exercise price  the period that the option has yet to run to its expiry date  and  no doubt  other considerations  The question of what value is to be ascribed to out of the money options is difficult  In the Option Scheme they have been valued using the Black Scholes option pricing methodology which takes into account factors of the kind mentioned  Grant Samuel has discussed the appropriateness of applying that methodology  in section     at pp     of its report  and has expressed the opinion that the valuation arrived at for the out of the money options is  generous  and is  fair and reasonable and in the best interests of holders of  out of the money  options and  that  overall the option proposal is fair and reasonable and accordingly in the best interests of option holders
