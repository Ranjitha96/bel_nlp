Luck v University of Southern Queensland   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldiscussedAmbard v Attorney General for Trinidad and Tobago   AC  Because justice is administered in public  judges and their decisions are open to public scrutiny  Over   years ago Lord Atkin said that committal for contempt of court by scandalising the Court had become obsolete  Ambard v Attorney General for Trinidad and Tobago   AC   at    But this should not obscure the distinction between baseless attacks on judges or courts that undermine public confidence and the administration of justice and the right of the public to criticise the administration of justice and those who are involved in that endeavour  The right to criticise is wide  Critics can make outspoken comments about the exercise of judicial power provided that they do so in good faith  Ambard   AC at    A fair minded and informed lay observer will be robust about criticism of judges  courts and their decisions because he or she will know the latitude afforded to commentators in our free society  And  he or she would know that if a public complaint had been made that  say  a judge was corrupt  it would almost certainly be investigated by the relevant authorities and be the subject of vigorous examination in the media  A fair minded observer would also be aware that disgruntled litigants  cranks and others may make unsubstantiated or false allegations against judges or courts which are either investigated and found to be baseless or so obviously baseless that they ought not be taken seriously referred toBienstein v Bienstein   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe mere fact that a judge before his or her appointment was instructed by a solicitor  or firm of solicitors  or acted or appeared for a client  is incapable of being a reasonable basis on which a fair minded and informed lay person could form a reasonable apprehension of bias  Bienstein v Bienstein   HCA         ALR   at     per McHugh  Kirby and Callinan JJ  Everyone knows that most judges have been appointed from private practice  and indeed that most of them have been barristers  Barristers  as a matter of professional practice  obey the cab rank rule  namely that they must accept instructions to appear where they are available and practice in the field  unless they have some proper basis to refuse the instructions  At the bar  barristers frequently appear in unrelated cases for and against the same clients  and barristers frequently are instructed by a firm of solicitors one day  and appear the next day in another case where that firm acts for or instructs the barrister s opponent  or his or her former client  Upon assuming judicial office  those past dealings are at an end for the judge  The judge is  and must be  independent of the past associations  That is the essence of judicial independence  It is not tenable to suggest that any mere association Ms Luck has raised provides any possible ground for a reasonable apprehension of bias by the fair minded and informed lay observer  Bienstein   ALR at      I need say no more than there is no substance in any of the assertions that Ms Luck relies upon to claim an apprehension of bias  A fair minded and informed lay observer would not reasonably apprehend  on the bases relied on by Ms Luck  that I might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of her matter  For these reasons  I reject Ms Luck s application that I disqualify myself from hearing her matter   I certify that the preceding twenty

Hayne J agreeing appliedEbner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe principle upon which a judge will be disqualified from participating in judicial proceedings on the ground of apprehended bias was explained by Gleeson CJ  McHugh  Gummow and Hayne JJ in Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy   HCA         CLR   at       Their Honours said         a judge is disqualified if a fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide  Significantly  their Honours went on to explain   Ebner   CLR at     how the principle is applied in two steps  namely     First  it requires the identification of what it is said might lead a judge  or juror  to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits  The second step is no less important  There must be an articulation of the logical connection between the matter and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the case on its merits  The bare assertion that a judge  or juror  has an  interest  in litigation  or an interest in a party to it  will be of no assistance until the nature of the interest  and the asserted connection with the possibility of departure from impartial decision making  is articulated  Only then can the reasonableness of the asserted apprehension of bias be assessed  The procedures laid down in s   of the Constitution assure that  relevantly  a judge of a court established by the Parliament can only be removed from office by the Governor General  on an address by both Houses of the Parliament  on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity  Mere untested and unsubstantiated allegations cannot ordinarily provide a reasonable basis for disquiet in the community that a judge may or may not perform his or her constitutional functions  Such allegations ordinarily cannot be a reasonable  proper or legitimate basis for any litigant to ask a judge to disqualify himself or herself  The more this is so when the allegations are not said to relate to anything to do with the case of the litigant seeking the judge s disqualification  or to lead to any connection between the allegations and the judge s performance of his or her function to hear and determine that or any other matter in accordance with the judicial oath  see Ebner   CLR at        Indeed  as Gleeson CJ  McHugh  Gummow and Haynes JJ said in Ebner   CLR at            if the mere making of an insubstantial objection was sufficient to lead to a judge to decline to hear or decide a case  the system would soon reach a stage where  for practical purposes  individual parties could influence the composition of the bench  That would be intolerable  The bare assertion that someone has published a complaint about a judge on the internet or elsewhere does not provide a logical connection between the matters to which Ms Luck has referred  and my ability  constitutional function and duty to decide her matter impartially  in accordance with its legal and factual merits  Nor has Ms Luck articulated any such logical connection discussedJohnson v Johnson   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlEarlier  in Johnson v Johnson   HCA         CLR   at     Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow and Hayne JJ emphasised that the hypothetical reasonable observer of a judge s conduct is an objective person who is taken to be reasonable and the judge being observed is a professional judge whose training tradition and oath or affirmation require the judge to discard the irrelevant  the immaterial and the prejudicial citedKartinyeri v Commonwealth     ALR  Importantly  a judge s duty is to hear and determine the litigation before him or her  In Livesey v New South Wales Bar Association   HCA         CLR   at   Mason  Murphy  Brennan  Deane and Dawson JJ said that         it would be an abdication of judicial function and an encouragement of procedural abuse for a judge to adopt the approach that he should automatically disqualify himself whenever he was requested by one party so to do on the grounds of a possible appearance of pre judgment or bias  regardless of whether the other party desired that the matter be dealt with by him as the judge to whom the hearing of the case had been entrusted by the ordinary procedures and practice of the particular court      see too Kartinyeri v Commonwealth     ALR   at         per Callinan J followedLivesey v New South Wales Bar Association   HCA         CLR  http www

to the conclusion that a judge or court had given rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias that he or she could not hear a case  merely because one website or commentator had attacked the judge or court or a decision  A fair minded and informed lay observer would say to himself or herself that     Although this looks serious  it is about a judge  If this had anything in it  surely the authorities would have looked at it  The judge has not been charged with anything  there is no public inquiry  Like everyone else  a judge is entitled to be presumed innocent until he or she is proved
