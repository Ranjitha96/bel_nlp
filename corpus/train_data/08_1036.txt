to order reinstatement  in contending that the Full Court would have that power  Alphapharm relies on Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR     Woolworths   at     per Sundberg and Bennett JJ  Lundbeck contends that Woolworths is distinguishable  That case concerned s  b  of the Trade Marks Act    Cth   TM Act  in circumstances in which a trade mark had been registered pursuant to the order of the primary Judge and the issue was whether the Court  in its appellate jurisdiction  had power to order removal of the mark  There are some differences between s   of the Act and s  b  of the TM Act   Lundbeck points out that there has been no judicial determination of the Court s power to order reinstatement of an entry in the Register where the Court has ordered removal of particulars of an extension of term and the order for rectification of the Register has been implemented   I will not explore the present question  It suffices to say that while I suspect that it would be within the implied power of the Court to order reinstatement  there is some doubt which is not clearly removed by Woolworths    There should be a stay in relation to removal of the extension of the term  The potential hardship to Lundbeck if there is no stay  it succeeds in its appeal  and the Court is found to lack power to order reinstatement  far exceeds the hardship to Alphapharm if there is a stay  it successfully resists Lundbeck s appeal  and the appeal is not determined until after   June     As a condition of getting the stay  the Lundbeck parties must give to the Court the usual undertaking as to damages  an undertaking to prosecute their appeal expeditiously  and related undertakings citedHughes v Western Australian Cricket Association  Inc    ATPR     Section   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  gives the Court a broad discretion to award costs  In Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association  Inc    ATPR       Toohey J stated  at        Ordinarily  costs follow the event and a successful litigant receives his costs in the absence of special circumstances justifying some other order  Ritter v  Godfrey     K B           Where a litigant has succeeded only upon a portion of his claim  the circumstances may make it reasonable that he bear the expense of litigating that portion upon which he has failed  Forster v  Farquhar     Q B           A successful party who has failed on certain issues may not only be deprived of the costs of those issues but may be ordered as well to pay the other party s costs of them  In this sense   issue  does not mean a precise issue in the technical pleading sense but any disputed question of fact or of law  Cretazzo v  Lombardi     S A S R    at   citedBowen Investments Pty Ltd v Tabcorp Holdings Ltd  No     FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Even if  the event  is easily identified  it will not always be just that costs follow the event  see Bowen Investments Pty Ltd v Tabcorp Holdings Ltd  No     FCAFC    The notion of costs following the event is not straightforward in the present case   Generally speaking  in the Revocation Proceeding  Lundbeck succeeded in defending the Patent against the attack by Alphapharm  Claim   was held invalid  but overall this did not assume great importance  Lundbeck succeeded on its cross claim for infringement but only to a minor extent  and otherwise Alphapharm succeeded on that cross claim   Through the Arrow Proceeding  Arrow joined cause with Alphapharm in the attack on the Patent  There was no claim that Arrow had infringed the Patent
