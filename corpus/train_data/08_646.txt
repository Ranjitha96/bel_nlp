Granada Tavern v Smith   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldiscussedBriginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The appellants now appeal to this Court  Essentially the duress alleged was the threatened and actual deprivation of Ms Wills of weekend work  The appellants attack some of his Honour s fact finding  They say that even accepting the facts as found  a case of contravention was not made out  They say there was a misunderstanding of the principles laid down in Briginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR   at      They say the reasons given by his Honour were inadequate   Ms Wills started work at the Tavern on   February    At the time she was nineteen  She had commenced studying a course of business management at the University on a full time basis in   and was still engaged in those studies  She worked predominantly as a waitress in the restaurant but occasionally in the kitchen   Up until August   Ms Wills worked generally three or four dinner shifts during the week and also on weekends when she was regularly rostered to work both days  She was almost always rostered to work on the Sunday lunch shift  The work roster at the Tavern for each week was written on a sheet of paper displayed on a wall between the kitchen and the bar  usually one or two weeks in advance  The employee responsible for compiling the rosters was Mr Michael Taylor  He was the head chef and had worked at the Tavern for over ten years  He was Ms Wills  immediate superior  She often spoke with Mr Taylor about the number of shifts per week that she wanted to work  She told him she needed to work four or five shifts per week or approximately fourteen hours in order to meet her financial commitments   The appeal grounds can be summarised as follows    His Honour erred in finding that duress was applied in connection with an AWA  Grounds         His Honour misapplied the principles laid down in Briginshaw v Briginshaw at      Ground     Findings concerning Ms Wills being a  ringleader  and that her work hours changed  dramatically  were not open  Ground    Other errors were alleged in a  Schedule of Fact Finding Errors    His Honour failed to properly consider and deal with the appellants  submissions  Ground    Ground   alleging that the penalties were excessive  was not pursued   There were ten matters complained of under this heading    Pressure  not applied in connection with AWA   Plainly the evidence established that Mr Hibberd was keen to have AWAs signed by employees  especially because he had discovered that he did not have a valid AWA regime existing  All his dealings with Ms Wills referred to by his Honour were directed towards her signing an AWA  indeed they were concerned with little else  Prior to the AWA issue Ms Wills had virtually no contact with Mr Hibberd  The change to her weekend rosters was obviously intended to disadvantage her in the context of her resistance to signing an AWA  It is hard to see how his Honour could have come to any other conclusion   It was submitted before his Honour that the respondent had to establish that the conduct of Mr Hibberd amounted to a  compulsion of the will of Ms Wills such as to have the effect of giving her no other practical alternative than to sign the AWA   There had to have been an  overbearing of the will    His Honour said      I accept  as both parties submitted  that the principles applicable in Briginshaw v Briginshaw and Another   HCA         CLR    Briginshaw  should be applied to allegations such as duress  I note that  not surprisingly  the Respondents sought to place the definition of duress  as it were  at the highest level  It was submitted  First and Second Respondents  outline of closing submission  that  clear  cogent  strong and strict proof is required   paragraph      The authority cited in support of that proposition as a footnote was the observation of Ryan J in Canturi at    What Ryan J actually said at paragraph   was      I accept that the onus of proving duress remains on the applicants and it is one which  having regard to the seriousness of the alleged contravention  has to be proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the Court in accordance with Briginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR          In my view it is preferable to approach an issue such as a finding of duress in accordance with what are well established principles  To seek to elevate duress to any particular level of significance is only likely to cloud the issues  While I bear well in mind the observations of the Courts as to the hesitations that should be borne in mind in considering issues both of duress generally and even more so of economic duress  it seems to me that in the ultimate the Court is faced in this instance with an alleged breach of the terms of a subsection of the Act  which is required to be proved to the satisfaction of the Court in accordance with Briginshaw principles   Later at   his Honour said that he was satisfied of  all the above matters   ie the matters in     quoted at   above   to what Ryan J in Canturi described as  the requisite degree  when referring to Briginshaw principles    The complaint of the appellants on the appeal centred on his Honour s statement that the appellants  sought to place the definition of duress at its highest level   at    This was said by the appellants to manifest a misunderstanding  of the application of the Briginshaw principle to the case before him    I think that all his Honour was conveying was that the appellants had submitted  as might have been expected  that duress was a serious allegation  It is inherent in the forensic process that a defendant will stress the seriousness of the charge alleged  be it civil or criminal  As counsel for the respondents submitted  correctly  and  in the light of the recent Full Court decision to be discussed hereafter  presciently  the principle in Briginshaw is simply that serious misconduct is not lightly to be found because it is not ordinarily engaged in by members of the community   In any event  it may be that  if anything  his Honour s application of Briginshaw was too favourable to the appellants  I say that because the true nature and effect of Briginshaw has recently been the subject of detailed analysis by Branson J  with whom French and Jacobson JJ agreed  in Qantas Airways Ltd v Gama   FCAFC     Branson J explained that expressions like  the Briginshaw standard  and  the Briginshaw test  should be avoided because of their tendency to mislead  Her Honour cited  at   the well known passage from the judgment of Dixon J in that case at     Fortunately    at common law no third standard of persuasion was definitely developed  Except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution  it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal  But reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved  The seriousness of an allegation made  the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description  or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding  are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal   Her Honour emphasised at     that Dixon J was speaking of  allegations  that is to say individual allegations of material fact  rather than  for example  causes of action  Nor did Dixon J identify any particular standard  rather that the tribunal of fact  before accepting the truth of evidence of a particular allegation  should give consideration to the nature of the allegation and the likely consequences which follow should it be accepted   Applying that approach to the present case  it may be doubted whether the particular allegations of fact in this case  for example that Mr Hibberd or Ms Bercheree said or did such and such or had such and such intention  really involve allegations of particular gravity  They are to be contrasted with allegations of adultery   Briginshaw   or fraud   Rejfek    The AWA regime is  or was at the time  part of a complex statutory industrial law system  Knowledge of its full ramifications amongst all employers is not self evidently a circumstance on which courts can safely rely  Breaches of the law may well occur in ignorance  Moral opprobrium does not necessarily attach  Of course  particular factual allegations in AWA duress cases may involve allegations of reprehensible behaviour  see  for example  the conduct in Jordan   While the conduct alleged against Mr Hibberd certainly warranted the learned Magistrate s criticisms  I doubt if it could be characterised as conduct inherently unlikely to be engaged in by employers   In the light of the Full Court s decision in Gama one does not say   Contravention of s   is a serious matter  therefore the Briginshaw standard applies   Rather  the fact finder must look at the particular factual allegations  They can vary infinitely  Before reaching a finding which accepts those allegations as true  the onus of course being on the applicant  the fact finder must  amongst other things  take into account the gravity of the particular allegations  s  c   Once the facts are fully found  including the making of inferences from primary fact  the question whether those facts fall within the statutory prescription of applying duress in connection with an AWA is a question of law  Hope v City of Bathurst   HCA         CLR   at     Gama is an important decision  not least for throwing light on an intriguing phenomenon in Australian professional legal culture  The resilience of the common law is such that in practice the Evidence Act is often overlooked  In my own experience  in the period of well over a decade since the Evidence Act was introduced Briginshaw is without fail cited in witness actions with the possible exception of patent infringement cases but I do not recall ever being referred to s    This is not to say it never happens  but a search of the Federal Court internal judgment database reveals only six decisions  apart from Gama    including one in the Full Court  in which the covering list of legislation and cases cited refers to both s   and Briginshaw  appliedCanturi v Sita Coaches Pty Ltd   FCR   Whatever may be the position in other contexts  s   does not require  as an essential element of contravention  an overbearing of the will of the employee  There can still be a contravention even if  as in the present case  the employee does not sign the AWA and thus has not had his or her will overborne  By contrast  at common law the question of duress will usually only arise where the plaintiff is seeking to avoid the consequence of some act or event allegedly produced by the duress of the defendant  such as the payment of money or the entering into a contract  In Canturi v Sita Coaches Pty Ltd   FCR   at   Ryan J  after reviewing the authorities  stated the position as follows  In my view  the consensus of the authorities to which I have referred is that duress  in the relevant sense  involves the illegitimate application of pressure to induce a party to enter into an AWA  or to discourage a party from taking that course  What is illegitimate is a question of fact to be decided in the circumstances of each case which may include whether there is an existing relationship of employer and employee or some other relationship of utmost good faith between the parties to the proposed AWA  As is made clear by the last sentence in the passage from the judgment of the Full Court in Schanka  v Employment National  Administration  Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     quoted at   above  it is not only pressure which in fact overbears the will of one party so as to result in an AWA being concluded that can amount to duress  Accordingly  I cannot accept the argument advanced on behalf of the respondents that  neither Napoli nor Canturi submitted to the alleged duress so it cannot be contended that their will was overborne  or that the conduct alleged against the respondents was illegitimate    Later at   his Honour said that he was satisfied of  all the above matters   ie the matters in     quoted at   above   to what Ryan J in Canturi described as  the requisite degree  when referring to Briginshaw principles  citedEmployment Advocate v Williamson   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Her Honour pointed out that the Evidence Act    Cth  contained a provision dealing with standard of proof in civil matters  viz s     which is as follows        In a civil proceeding  the court must find the case of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance of probabilities      Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied  it is to take into account     a  the nature of the cause of action or defence  and    b  the nature of the subject matter of the proceeding  and    c  the gravity of the matters alleged     As her Honour had noted  with the concurrence of Kenny J  in Employment Advocate v Williamson   FCA         FCR   at     s   of the Evidence Act was intended to reflect the common law position as to the strength of evidence necessary to establish satisfaction on the balance of probabilities citedFox v Percy   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Generally as to the setting aside of findings of fact that rest on credibility findings by the trial judge  the position is as summarised by McHugh J in Fox v Percy   HCA         CLR   at           Whether an appellate court should intervene in a decision of a trial judge who has made findings based on the credibility or demeanour of a witness is governed by the principles stated in Abalos v Australian Postal Commission  In that case  I said  at          W here a trial judge has made a finding of fact contrary to the evidence of a witness but has made no reference to that evidence  an appellate court cannot act on that evidence to reverse the finding unless it is satisfied  that any advantage enjoyed by the trial judge by reason of having seen and heard the witnesses  could not be sufficient to explain or justify the trial judge s conclusion    Watt  or Thomas  v Thomas   AC   at           W hen a trial judge resolves a conflict of evidence between witnesses  the subtle influence of demeanour on his or her determination cannot be overlooked       Mason CJ  Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  the other members of the Court  agreed with my judgment  Abalos was applied in Devries v Australian National Railways Commission   HCA         CLR   at   where Brennan and Gaudron JJ and I said      More than once in recent years  this Court has pointed out that a finding of fact by a trial judge  based on the credibility of a witness  is not to be set aside because an appellate court thinks that the probabilities of the case are against    even strongly against    that finding of fact   Footnote omitted   If the trial judge s finding depends to any substantial degree on the credibility of the witness  the finding must stand unless it can be shown that the trial judge  has failed to use or has palpably misused his advantage    SS Hontestroom v SS Sagaporack   AC   at   or has acted on evidence which was  inconsistent with facts incontrovertibly established by the evidence  or which was  glaringly improbable    Brunskill   HCA         ALJR   at     ALR   at         There was nothing novel about these statements  They derived from principles in decisions of this Court and the House of Lords stretching over the best part of a century   In the present case the appellants  attack on the credibility findings in respect of Ms Wills does not come near that standard of appellate review   The  concentration camp  comment   It may be that Mr Hibberd was attempting to make the point that if different employees were working on different conditions he would have to ensure that people on the Award did not get such additional benefits as the AWA provided  However  the tone and context in which the term was used were very much matters for his Honour  who had the opportunity to assess the witnesses  and in particular Ms Wills   The appellants say that his Honour failed to deal with submissions made as to fact and law   little or no reference  was made to submissions by the appellants on the evidence   The Federal Magistrates Court was established by the Federal Magistrates Act    Cth   One of the objects of that Act was  to enable the Federal Magistrates Court to operate as informally as possible in the exercise of judicial power  s  a   Likewise s   provides  In proceedings before it  the Federal Magistrates Court must proceed without undue formality and must endeavour to ensure that the proceedings are not protracted   His Honour s judgment  handed down expeditiously some six weeks after final submissions  extends over   pages  It deals in detail with the events at the Tavern in    It makes clear findings of fact  It cites the appropriate legislation and authorities  It explains the reasoning which led to his Honour s decision  The appellants on reading the judgment would understand why they lost  Perhaps his Honour did not record and deal with every argument advanced on behalf of the appellants  but he was not obliged to do so citedHope v City of Bathurst   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In the light of the Full Court s decision in Gama one does not say   Contravention of s   is a serious matter  therefore the Briginshaw standard applies   Rather  the fact finder must look at the

No legal right or legitimate expectation of Ms Wills removed or threatened   Removal or threatened removal of something which can be characterised as a legal right or legitimate expectation is not an essential element of the concept of duress under the statute  In any event  with her established pattern of weekend work  an  unwritten agreement  as Mr Taylor termed it  Ms Wills plainly did have a legitimate expectation  cf Jordan v Mornington Inn Pty Ltd     IR   at    Of necessity  a legitimate expectation is something less than a legal right   No actual or threatened detriment sufficient to constitute duress   The loss of shifts  particularly on weekends was  on the evidence  a serious detriment to Ms Wills  She was a student who depended on part time employment to survive   Applying that approach to the present case  it may be doubted whether the particular allegations of fact in this case  for example that Mr Hibberd or Ms Bercheree said or did such and such or had such and such

Ltd v Gold Peg International Pty Ltd   FCAFC         ALR   an issue arose as to the adequacy of the reasons of the trial judge  Weinberg J and I said    As to the second matter  the obligations of the trial judge to give adequate reasons  on the appeal Kovan relied strongly on what was said by Nettle JA  with whom Batt and Vincent JJA agreed  in Hunter v Transport Accident Commission     MVR   at    While noting that the extent of the reasons will depend on the circumstances of the case  his Honour said that the reasons should deal with the  substantial  points which have been raised  include findings on  material  questions of fact and provide an  intelligible  explanation of the reasoning from evidence to findings to ultimate conclusion  Reference to the evidence should not be limited to the evidence that has been accepted and acted upon  but  ordinarily  should deal with the  substantial  points made in evidence which has been rejected and explain why it has been rejected  The judge must deal with evidence which is  relevant and cogent  arguments which are  substantial  and issues which are  significant     No matter how prescriptive the principles laid down  they inevitably involve disclaimers as to any universal applicability  Moreover  the passage from Hunter would give an unbalanced view if it were not read in conjunction with the firm warnings of courts of high authority against over lengthy judgments  These are noted by the Full Court in Expectation  Pty Ltd v PRD Realty Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR   at     Of the cases there referred to  particular note should be taken of what was said by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Digi Tech  Aust  Ltd v Brand   NSWCA         IPR   at     and the following passage from the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ  McHugh and Gummow JJ in Whisprun Pty Ltd v Dixon   HCA         ALR    at           it should not be accepted that Newman J failed  at least in a general way  to consider the matters to which the Court of Appeal referred  The fact that his Honour did not refer to these matters in his judgment is not decisive  A judge s reasons are not required to mention every fact or argument relied on by the losing party as relevant to an issue  Judgments of trial judges would soon become longer than they already are if a judge s failure to mention such facts and arguments would be evidence that he or she had not properly considered the losing party s case        As the Full Court said in Expectation  at   in the normal case statements by a trial judge of a general assertive nature can be accepted as encompassing a detailed consideration of the evidence  As their Honours immediately go on to say  such statements should be treated with some reserve where there has been  significant  delay between trial and judgment  After such a delay          a more comprehensive statement of the relevant evidence than would normally be required should be provided by the trial judge in order to make manifest  to the parties and the public  that the delay has not affected the decision           As to the suggested obligation on the trial judge to explain why evidence or argument of the losing party has been rejected  we would refer to what was said by Schiemann LJ in Customs and Excise Commissioners v A     All ER   at     in a passage cited with approval in Digi Tech  at           judges should bear in mind that the primary function of a first instance judgment is to find facts and identify the crucial legal points and to advance reasons for deciding them in a particular way  The longer a judgment is and the more issues with which it deals the greater the likelihood that   i  the losing party  the Court of Appeal and any future readers of the judgment will not be able to identify the crucial matters which swayed the judge   ii  the judgment will contain something with which the unsuccessful party can legitimately take issue and attempt to launch an appeal   iii  citation of the judgment in future cases will lengthen the hearing of those future cases because time will be taken sorting out the precise status of the judicial observation in question  and  iv  reading the judgment will occupy a considerable amount of the time of legal advisers to other parties in future cases who again will have to sort out the status of the judicial observation in question  All this adds to the cost of obtaining legal advice      Often it is not possible to reconcile neatly all evidence and arguments  Sometimes evidence or arguments of the losing party may be valid in themselves  it is just that there seem to the trial judge to be other and more persuasive items of evidence and points of argument the other way  If the trial judge does not mention such evidence or arguments of the losing party an appellate court may take a different view  It may reverse the decision below because it finds the appellant s evidence or arguments persuasive  But that will be because the appeal court took a different view of the facts or law from that of the trial judge  not because the trial judge made a legal error in the way his or her reasons were expressed    provided the minimum requirements identified by Schiemann LJ are satisfied   The other member of the Court in Kovan   Allsop J  said    As to the discussion of the adequacy of the reasons of the primary judge  in addition to my complete agreement with Heerey and Weinberg JJ  I would only wish to make reference to what Mahoney JA said in Housing Commission of New South Wales v Tatmar Pastoral Co Pty Ltd     NSWLR   at    a decision affirmed sub nom Tatmar Pastoral Co Pty Ltd v Housing Commission of New South Wales     ALR        I t is the duty of the judge to state his reasons for deciding as he does and that his failure to do so may constitute an error of law     However  such a duty does not exist in respect of every matter  of fact or of law  which was or might have been raised in the proceeding  It is not the duty of the judge to decide every matter which is raised in argument  He may decide a case in a way which does not require the determination of a particular submission  In such a case he may put it aside or  as Lord Scarman said  merely salute it in passing  R v Barnet London Borough Council  Ex parte Nilish Shah     AC   at    A judge will  of course  appreciate the possibility of points being taken or decided on appeal which were not taken or decided below and for this reason he may decide  and give reasons for his decision on  matters which in strictness he need not decide      See also Soulemezis v Dudley  Holdings  Pty Ltd     NSWLR   at     and       These observations apply a fortiori to the Federal Magistrates Court with its statutory mandate for informality and expedition

html  Conduct was not illegitimate or unconscionable   Lawful conduct can constitute duress  Maritime Union of Australia v Geraldton Port Authority   FCA         ALR   at     Characterising conduct as unconscionable involves a value judgement  His Honour was entitled to consider the relative age and power positions of the parties and the way in which Mr Hibberd exploited that position  for example by denying that Ms Wills had a pattern of weekend work  The picture of Mr Hibberd emerging from the evidence of Ms Wills  whom his Honour found to be  impressive  and  a young woman of some fortitude   at   was of a man behaving in an overbearing way to a vulnerable employee   Not established that Mr Hibberd intentionally applied duress to Ms Wills in connection with an AWA   The conduct of Mr Hibberd and Ms Berechree  especially in their directions to Mr Taylor regarding the roster  was intentional conduct  plainly meant to apply pressure to Ms Wills in connection with an AWA  It had no other purpose that is apparent  Ms Wills  note  which disclosed at the very least that she was not about to sign the AWA and accept whatever Mr Hibberd was pleased to give her  was followed the next day by his directions  This was hardly a coincidence   Not established Ms Wills regarded as a ringleader   This was a finding well open in the light of Ms Wills  conduct at the meetings of   and   August and Mr Hibberd s suggesting at the latter meeting that Ms Wills was acting as a bargaining agent  In any event  this is not a factual finding of critical importance  Whether or not Ms Wills was the ringleader  or seen as such by Mr Hibberd  unconscionable pressure was applied to her citedNeat Holdings Pty Ltd v Karajan Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth

probabilities and the gravity or otherwise of the fact of whose existence the mind is to be persuaded are not to be confused   Emphasis added by Branson J in Gama at    appliedQantas Airways Ltd v Gama   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In any event  it may be that  if anything  his Honour s application of Briginshaw was too favourable to the appellants  I say that because the true nature and effect of Briginshaw has recently been the subject of detailed analysis by Branson J  with whom French and Jacobson JJ agreed  in Qantas Airways Ltd v Gama   FCAFC     Gama itself was a case of alleged racial discrimination  Branson J noted the various considerations which s     in the circumstances of the case  required to be taken into account  With regard to  the gravity of the matter alleged  her Honour said at   Without wishing to diminish the significance of the factual allegations made by Mr Gama  which themselves varied in gravity  more serious allegations of racial discrimination can be brought to mind   Her Honour had earlier noted at   that   The legislative requirement for complaints of unlawful discrimination to be made in the first instance to the President  of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission  reflects a recognition  as it seems to me  that the practical implications of human rights principles are not always well understood by members of the Australian community  For this reason  not only may claims of discrimination lack substance but acts of discrimination may occur without the actor intending to breach those principles  For these reasons moral opprobrium may  but does not necessarily  attach to an allegation of discriminatory conduct   In conclusion  her Honour said at      in my view  for the reasons given above  references to  for example   the Briginshaw standard  or  the onerous Briginshaw test  and  in that context  to racial discrimination being a serious matter not lightly to be inferred  have a tendency to lead a trier of facts into error  The correct approach to the standard of proof in a civil proceeding in a federal court is that for which s   of the Evidence Act provides  It is an approach which recognises  adopting the language of the High Court in Neat Holdings  that the strength of the evidence necessary to establish a fact in issue on the balance of probabilities will vary according to the nature of what is sought to be proved and  I would add  the circumstances in which it is sought to be proved   In the light of the Full Court s decision in Gama one does not say   Contravention of s   is a serious matter  therefore the Briginshaw standard applies   Rather  the fact finder must look at the particular factual allegations  They can vary infinitely  Before reaching a finding which accepts those allegations as true  the onus of course being on the applicant  the fact finder must  amongst other things  take into account the gravity of the particular
