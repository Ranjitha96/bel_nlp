Brother Industries  Ltd v Dynamic Supplies Pty Ltd   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlrelatedBrother Industries  Ltd v Dynamic Supplies Pty Ltd     IPR   These reasons arise from an application by the applicants  Brother  for an order for costs on an indemnity basis  having been substantially successful in proceedings against the respondent  Dynamic Supplies  concerning infringement of trade marks and other matters  see Brother Industries  Ltd v Dynamic Supplies Pty Ltd     IPR    The application for indemnity costs relies not only on Dynamic Supplies  rejection of several offers of compromise made by Brother before the hearing but also on the manner in which the litigation was conducted by Dynamic Supplies   Three offers of compromise were made by Brother to Dynamic Supplies before the hearing on trade mark infringement  The first and second offers were in virtually identical terms  so it is convenient and sufficient for the purposes of O   r   of the Federal Court Rules    Cth  simply to look at the first and third offers  which are substantially different  and compare them with the relief ultimately granted in the orders of the Court  O   r   provides that if an offer is made by an applicant and not accepted by a respondent  and the applicant obtains a judgment on the claim to which the offer relates which is not less favourable than the terms of the offer  then  unless the Court otherwise orders  the applicant is entitled to an order against the respondent for costs incurred in respect of the claim up to the day when the offer was made taxed on a party party basis and after that day taxed on an indemnity basis  The objective of this provision is clearly to encourage settlement of litigation   When considering the application of the above provision  the task of the Court is to consider the relevant offer of compromise  compare it with the orders actually made by the Court and determine whether the offer made is less favourable to the offeree than the final relief in the proceeding  If it is  then indemnity costs will not be awarded  subject to the discretion of the Court consideredColgate Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd     FCR   Under s   of the Federal Court Act    Cth  the Court has a discretion as to costs orders  As a general principle  costs are awarded on a party party basis unless there are special or unusual circumstances  Some of the broad classes of circumstances in which the exercise of discretion to award indemnity costs may be appropriate are set out in the judgment of Sheppard J in Colgate Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd     FCR   at      These include the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions  an imprudent refusal of an offer of compromise and the making of allegations which ought never to have been made  Another relevant consideration for the award of indemnity costs is where the applicant  properly advised  should have known that he or she had no chance of success  see Fountain Selected Meals  Sales  Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd     ALR   at   citedDukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Limited   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au

from the Court  an order for payment for costs on an indemnity basis does not automatically follow  see Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Limited   FCAFC   at     Where the requirements of O   r   are satisfied  the entitlement to an order for costs on an indemnity basis in respect of costs incurred after the date of the offer is subject to the discretion of the Court  When considering the exercise of this discretion  it is necessary to take into account whether it was imprudent or unreasonable to expect the offeree to accept the offer of compromise  having regard to the context and circumstances in which it was given  see Seven Network Ltd News Ltd   FCA   at    citedFountain Selected Meals  Sales  Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd     ALR   Under s   of the
