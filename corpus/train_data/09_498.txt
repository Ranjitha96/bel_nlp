HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThird  while it is certainly the case that the Court may be receptive to an application for non party costs against a third party whose conduct has promoted the litigation   Arundel   HCA         ALR   at   or can be characterised as having been that of wanton and officious intermeddling with the disputes of others in which the meddler has no interest whatsoever   Murphy v Young   Co s Brewery   EWCA Civ         WLR   at   Arundel   HCA         ALR   at   there is no evidence of such intermeddling by Mrs Tracy in this case  So  for example  I infer that the regular attendance by Mrs Tracy at the trial was  not unreasonably  to support the second applicant  because the outcome of the trial was important to the second applicant  Further  the comment by Counsel for the applicants during the hearing that he would discuss the issue of an adjournment with  Mr and Mrs Tracy  in my view is not suggestive of meddling by Mrs Tracy in the applicants  case or an active part played by Mrs Tracy in the proceedings  Rather  as submitted by the applicants the comment merely recognised that Mrs Tracy would be present with the second applicant during the discussions  which was both unexceptional and understandable in the circumstances  The first and second respondents have made much of their claims concerning an alleged asset protection strategy of Mr and Mrs Tracy  comprising shifting of assets from the second applicant to Mrs Tracy  and security being given to Mrs Tracy  The first and second respondents have pointed to the alleged potential resultant unfairness to the first and second respondents in relation to their ability to recover costs  As matters stand  however  such claims are speculative  As a matter of legal principle such allegations concerning shifting assets would be of much more relevance in the context of claims  for example  pursuant to s   or s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  which deal specifically with improper transfers of property and asset protection by persons who subsequently become bankrupt  Obviously however those provisions are not the subject of these proceedings and consideration of principles associated with those provisions have no place in this judgment  While such claims may be relevant in considering the justice of the case  on balance I do not consider that any private financial arrangements of Mr and Mrs Tracy  the reasons for which must be the subject of pure speculation at this stage and upon which I express no opinion  are of particular weight in the context of this notice of motion  viewed in light of the circumstances as a whole and the factors I have already described  Mrs Tracy was not  in my view  a real party  to the litigation in very important and critical respects  contrast Arundel   HCA         ALR   at    While Mrs Tracy may have benefited financially from the success of the applicants as I have already noted  and as has been held in numerous cases  for example Bischof     VR     Vestris     SASR     Probiotec   FCAFC         FCR   the mere fact that a person may benefit  financially or otherwise  from litigation will not

 htmlNotwithstanding these submissions  I do not accept that the power of the Court to make orders as to non party costs in these proceedings has been exhausted simply because costs orders have already been made and entered against the applicants  This exact issue was decisively determined by the Full Court in Caboolture Park Shopping Centre Pty Ltd  in liquidation  v White Industries  Qld  Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR     wherein the Court considered s   and s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   Federal Court Act   So far as relevant  s   defines  proceeding  as meaning       in a court  whether between parties or not  and includes an incidental proceeding in the course of  or in connection with  a proceeding and also includes an appeal  Further  so far as relevant s   provides    the Court or a Judge has jurisdiction to award costs in all proceedings before the Court    In Caboolture Park   FCA         FCR   the respondent to those proceedings obtained judgment against the applicant including an order for costs  which judgment was entered  The applicant subsequently went into liquidation and the respondent sought a supplemental costs order against the applicant s solicitors which would have had the effect of making them liable for those costs  The solicitors submitted that  once the proceedings had been concluded by judgment being entered and by an order for costs being made inter partes   there was no jurisdiction thereafter for the Court to reopen the case  The solicitors also submitted that the jurisdiction contained in s   of the Federal Court Act to  award costs in all proceedings  was spent once there was no longer a  proceeding  before the Court  Applying Knight v FP Special Assets Ltd   HCA         CLR     the Full Court held that s   conferred jurisdiction to award costs against non parties to a proceeding  at    In relation to the submission of the solicitors concerning whether there was still a  proceeding  before the Court  the Full Court observed that the submission incorrectly confined the meaning of the word  proceeding  to the original action  and was inconsistent with the definition of  proceeding  in s   of the Federal Court Act  at    The Court continued    What s  requires is that the jurisdiction to order costs be one limited to costs relating to a proceeding  In other words  there is no jurisdiction to order costs at large  There has to be or have been  within the Court s jurisdiction  instituted a proceeding  It is irrelevant  subject to the application of common law principles discussed later  that judgment has been given and entered    emphasis added I note that the decision in Caboolture Park   FCA         FCR   is consistent with decisions in other jurisdictions  including Dymocks Franchise Systems  NSW  v Todd   UKPC         WLR     NSW Insurance Ministerial Corporation v Edkins     NSWLR   and UTSA Pty Ltd  In Liquidation  v Ultratune Australia Pty Ltd   VSC         VR    In this case the applicants have submitted that the orders sought by the first and second respondents are in substitution for the costs orders already made rather than supplemental  That is clearly not the case  It is irrelevant that the first and second respondents have sought an award of costs against Mrs Tracy on an indemnity basis  and therefore on different terms from those already obtained against the applicants  As was the case in Caboolture Park   FCA         FCR    where the costs were originally ordered on a standard basis but the Court subsequently ordered non party costs on an indemnity basis  the orders sought pursuant to the notice of motion currently before the Court do not in any way seek to vary or alter the costs orders already made against the applicants  Were the first and second respondents to be successful in relation to this notice of motion  the new orders would properly be characterised as supplemental orders  Accordingly  I find that the submissions of the applicants on this issue are not substantiated  and that the jurisdiction of the Court to award non party costs   be they on an indemnity basis or otherwise  pursuant to s   of the Federal Court Act was not spent when previous costs orders were entered  LIABILITY OF MRS TRACY FOR NON PARTY COSTS   Submissions of the parties I turn now to the key issue in this case  namely whether Mrs Tracy is liable for non party costs in respect of the costs of the first and second respondents in the primary proceedings  Helpful and detailed submissions as to the liability of Mrs Tracy for costs in the primary proceedings were filed by both parties in this case  and made orally by Counsel at the hearing  Submissions of the first and second respondents may be summarised as follows In response  the applicants submitted in summary  There is no suggestion that the purpose of the advance by Mrs Tracy of     million to the first and third applicants in March   to enable the first applicant to purchase land and business owned by the first respondent had any connection with these proceedings  There is no evidence that the list of assets provided to the National Australia Bank in support of the loan application including some of Mrs Tracy s assets was provided with Mrs Tracy s consent  knowledge or authority  as the list was executed by Mr Tracy alone  In any event this list is irrelevant as no security was provided by Mrs Tracy to the National Australia Bank in support of the loan application  In relation to Mrs Tracy s status as mortgagee  chargee and lender  it should be noted that both the National Australia Bank and  indeed  the first respondent  also had securities over the assets of the first applicant  Like the National Australia Bank and the first respondent Mrs Tracy s rights as mortgagee chargee accrued to her prior to the commencement of proceedings and none of the funds advanced were used to fund the litigation but rather were used to purchase the orchards  Accordingly  the securities over the orchards gave Mrs Tracy a direct financial interest in the assets of the first applicant  not the proceedings  Under the Sunstate Orchards Unit Trust Deed  Mrs Tracy is within the class of discretionary beneficiaries contained in Sch   Pt   of the Deed  Her position as a contingent beneficiary under the Sunstate Unit Trust gave her no direct interest in any of the Trust assets or income of the Trust which might have been received had the litigation been successful  Any benefits Mrs Tracy received if the litigation brought by the applicants had been successful would accrue only by virtue of the securities  and not by virtue of any action taken by her concerning the proceedings  There is no real  direct and material connection between the granting of the securities to Mrs Tracy and the proceedings  The fact that the first and second respondents have already obtained orders for security for costs militate against the exercise of the discretion to make an order for non party costs  Although the proceedings were initiated by Mrs Tracy as director of Janling Pty Ltd  the significance of the provision of instructions can only relate to the period during which the proceedings were maintained by Janling Pty Ltd  The first and second respondents have already had the benefit of a costs order against Janling Pty Ltd for the period prior to   February   when the applicants were substituted for Janling Pty Ltd in the primary proceedings  The applicants conceded that Mrs Tracy attended Court with the second applicant during the trial  A discussion between senior Counsel for the applicants  the second applicant and Mrs Tracy  as the second applicant s wife  was unexceptional and understandable  Notwithstanding the Deeds of Assignment of the causes of action from the applicants to Mrs Tracy and then from Mrs Tracy to Janling Pty Ltd  from   February   Janling Pty Ltd had no involvement in the proceedings and Mrs Tracy had no lawful capacity to provide any instructions for the conduct of the proceedings  The matter was resolved by consent orders made on   February    Relevant principles Although as a general rule costs are not awarded against a stranger to litigation  as I have already indicated it is well settled that the Court has a discretion pursuant to s   of the Federal Court Act to order costs against a non party in appropriate circumstances   Knight   HCA         CLR     Caboolture Park   FCA         FCR     Gore v Justice Corp Pty Ltd     FCR   Kebaro Pty Ltd v Saunders

costs incurred by the applicants in relation to interlocutory applications  the applicants pay the costs of the first and second respondents  such costs to be taxed if not otherwise agreed  In so ordering I rejected the claim of the first and second respondents that their costs be paid by the applicants on an indemnity basis  It became clear during the primary proceedings that  when considering the history of events culminating in the proceedings and all matters concerning the applicants  the second applicant played a pivotal role  All decisions  all discussions  and all negotiations were made  had and conducted by the second applicant on his own behalf and on behalf of the first and third applicants  The position is clouded by the assignment of causes of action  an issue to which I will return shortly  however prima facie the actual authority to make all decisions with respect to the conduct of litigation in the primary proceedings remained with the second applicant because of his historical role and his position as sole director and shareholder of the first applicant  and the sole director of the third applicant  Indeed as I found in the primary judgment  the second applicant was  at all material times  the directing mind and will of the first and third applicants   Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd  No     FCA   at

the High Court in Knight have closed the door to the categories of third parties who may be made liable for the costs of litigation nor that the circumstances that were identified by their Honours were exhaustive             and later       the learned trial judge erred when he regarded the passage in Knight as laying down three principles  each of which must be present before a stranger to the litigation could be made liable for costs   at  First  Mrs Tracy was never a director or shareholder of either the first or third applicants  In light of the dominant role played by the second applicant in the affairs of all applicants and the clear professional and financial stake of the second applicant in the businesses of the first and third applicants particularly as director and shareholder  it is clear that the failure of the proceedings would have had a much greater impact on the fortunes of the second applicant than on those of Mrs Tracy  I consider that it is likely that any financial support provided by Mrs Tracy to the applicants  case was motivated by Mrs Tracy s natural affection for the second applicant  cf Jackson v Thakrar   EWHC         All ER   at   rather than any financial interest she may have had in the outcome of the proceedings  In my view this is an important distinction between the supportive role played by Mrs Tracy of the applicants  and the

receiver of a company who is not a party to the litigation  That category of case consists of circumstances where the party to the litigation is an insolvent person or man of straw  where the non party has played an active part in the conduct of the litigation and where the non party  or some person on whose behalf he or she is acting or by whom he or she has been appointed  has an interest in

 at     Gore     FCR   at     it follows that the comments in Knight   HCA         CLR   could not prescribe prerequisites to the exercise of discretion to award costs against a non party  Inevitably  as the Full Court pointed out in Gore     FCR   at        there is no reason to suppose that the remarks of the members of the High Court in Knight have closed the door to the categories of third parties who may be made liable for the costs of litigation nor that the circumstances that were identified by their Honours were exhaustive             and later       the learned trial judge erred when he regarded the passage in Knight as laying down three principles  each of which must be present before a stranger to the litigation could be made liable for costs   at  I consider that it is appropriate to consider any potential liability of Mrs Tracy in terms of principles arising from cases where the courts have considered the exercise of the discretion to award costs against a non party  The principles articulated in Knight   HCA         CLR   are relevant as guiding factors only  in appropriate circumstances  Consideration It is common ground that the causes of action determined in the primary proceedings were purportedly assigned by the applicants to Mrs Tracy on   June   and then from Mrs Tracy to Janling Pty Ltd on   July     It is not in contention that at all material times the sole shareholder of Janling Pty Ltd was a corporation the sole shareholder of which in turn was Mrs Tracy  and that Mrs Tracy herself was the sole director of Janling Pty Ltd   I say  purportedly  because the first and second respondent filed a notice of motion on   December   seeking orders that the proceedings be dismissed and or struck out on the basis that  inter alia   the causes of action the subject of the primary proceedings were not assignable  TS   December   p   ll      Whether the assignment of the causes of action was valid ceased to be contentious when the parties agreed  and the Court ordered by consent on   February   that the strike out motion of the first and second respondents be dismissed  that Janling Pty Ltd be removed as the applicant to the primary proceedings  and that the first  second and third applicants be substituted as applicants  However notwithstanding the orders of   February   there is no evidence that the benefit of the relevant causes of action was reassigned by Janling Pty Ltd to the applicants  Accordingly any purported assignment of the causes of action  to the extent that the assignment took effect  remained with Janling Pty Ltd  It followed that presumably financial benefits of any success of the applicants in the proceedings would flow to Janling Pty Ltd  and thence to Mrs Tracy  The fact that the applicants were unsuccessful with respect to their claims against the first and second respondents  other than with respect to a number of reserved costs  is irrelevant in the context of this notice of motion  However in my view  notwithstanding potential financial benefits accruing to Mrs Tracy from the proceedings  the circumstances of this case do not warrant the exercise of the Court s discretion to award costs against Mrs Tracy pursuant to s   of the Federal Court Act  As I have already observed  the mere fact that a person may benefit from litigation will not  without more  suffice to justify an award of costs  I form this view for the following reasons citedLife Therapeutics Ltd v Bell IXL Investments Ltd  No     FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth

circumstances where financial support for litigation is provided by a spouse the proper starting point may be to regard any such support as motivated by the spouse s natural affection for the litigant  and therefore not such a circumstance where non party costs should be awarded in the absence of exceptional circumstances  cf Cooper v Maxwell   CA Transcript   Murphy   EWCA Civ         WLR   at     Jackson v Thakrar   EWHC         All ER   at    Knight Third  while it is certainly the case that the Court may be receptive to an application for non party costs against a third party whose conduct has promoted the litigation   Arundel   HCA         ALR   at   or can be characterised as having been that of wanton and officious intermeddling with the disputes of others in which the meddler has no interest whatsoever   Murphy v Young   Co s Brewery   EWCA Civ         WLR   at   Arundel   HCA         ALR   at   there is no evidence of such intermeddling by Mrs Tracy in this case  So  for example  I infer that the regular attendance by Mrs Tracy at the trial was  not unreasonably  to support the second applicant  because the outcome of the trial was important to the second applicant  Further  the comment by Counsel for the applicants during the hearing that he would discuss the issue of an adjournment with  Mr and Mrs Tracy  in my view is not suggestive of meddling by Mrs Tracy in the applicants  case or an active part played by Mrs Tracy in the proceedings  Rather  as submitted by the applicants the comment merely recognised that Mrs Tracy would be present with the second applicant during the discussions  which was both unexceptional and understandable in the circumstances  Fourth  while I note that Mrs Tracy assisted in providing security for costs which the applicants were ordered to pay  I consider that this is explainable by the natural inclination of a wife to support her husband in litigation to which he is a party and does not constitute an active part played by Mrs Tracy in the conduct of the litigation  As has been observed in numerous cases  funding alone will not justify an order where an otherwise disinterested relative has  out of natural affection  funded costs of a claim  Dillon LJ in Cooper v Maxwell   CA Transcript    Stuart Smith LJ and Mann LJ agreeing  Phillips LJ in Murphy   EWCA Civ         WLR   at     Jackson v Thakrar
