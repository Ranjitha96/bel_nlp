discussedWestern Australia v Native Title Registrar   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In Western Australia v Native Title Registrar   FCA         FCR     Carr J decided that the State of Western Australia was a  person aggrieved  for the purposes of making an application for review under s   of the ADJR Act in respect of a decision of the Registrar to admit for registration a particular native title claim  His Honour found that the adverse effect of registration upon the State so qualified it  because as owner of the land the subject of that particular native title claim  the State was restricted in its capacity to deal with its proprietary interest  and was obliged to submit to the statutory requirements of negotiation in respect of future acts under the NT Act  Obviously  the impact upon an owner of land of an application for the determination of native title being admitted for registration under s  A of the NT Act is different from the impact upon a person or persons in the position of the Batchelor No   applicants  They are competing native title claimants whose claim has been registered  and not land owners   One of the reasons Carr J reached that conclusion in Western Australia v Native Title Registrar   FCA       FCR   was that the government  being primarily responsible for the development and manner of use of the land the subject of that particular native title claim  had a  very close relationship with the subject matter  of the registration decision  and that the NT Act recognised that closeness by  for example  the requirement in s   of the Act not only that the State be notified of the application for registration  but also that it be supplied with all affidavits and documents in support of it  see at     A similar obligation is imposed upon the Registrar under s  A  of the NT Act in relation to the relevant representative body of the area covered by the application  in this case the NLC   I was referred by counsel for the Batchelor No   applicants to s  a i  of the NT Act  Under that provision  the Registrar is obliged to give notice containing details of an application for determination of native title to any registered native title claimant in relation to any of the area covered by the application which is being assessed for registration under s  A  I do not think that that provision operates to provide or enhance the status of the Batchelor No   applicants in this matter as persons aggrieved by the decision of the Registrar  That is because s   commences by saying that it is generally subject to the section  The Registrar s obligation is specifically then explained or qualified  at least in terms of the time when it must be implemented  by s  a   Pursuant to s  a  in the event of a claimant application  the Registrar must not comply with sub section   until the Registrar has decided  in accordance with s  A  whether or not to accept for registration the claim made in the application  In my view the position is clear  Not only is the Registrar not required by s  a i  to have given notice of the Batchelor No   application to the Batchelor No   applicants  as registered native title claimants in respect of the same claim area  until the Registrar has decided whether or not to accept the Batchelor No   application for registration  but he is positively directed not to do so by s  a    Consequently  if the Town of Batchelor No   applicants are to establish that they are persons aggrieved by the decision of the Registrar  they must do so by some circumstance un unsupported by  and perhaps even informed by  s  a    In my view  the procedural rights which they obtained by registration of the Town of Batchelor No   application are not  in terms  diminished by the fact of the acceptance for registration of the Town of Batchelor No   application  Their procedural rights under the Act remain the same  But  at a practical level  it is said that the enjoyment of those procedural rights is diminished because the persons with whom they have rights of negotiation would also have to deal with the Town of Batchelor No   applicants who would possess equivalent rights of negotiation  The outcomes of negotiations in relation to a future act or future acts which might be the subject of such negotiation would  it is argued  in a practical sense have to be shared or may have to be shared between the two sets of registered applicants  In my view  as a matter of commonsense  that is likely to be correct  In such negotiations  the person or entity who is the potential beneficiary of the future act is unlikely to negotiate in a way which would give each of the negotiating registered native title applicants the same benefits as if there were only one group of registered native title applicants with whom those negotiations should be conducted  To put it somewhat crudely  the potential fruits of the negotiations would probably be shared rather than doubled followeddiscussedStrickland and Nudding  on behalf of the Maduwongga People  v Native Title Registrar   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Upon that basis  in my view  the

discussedGriffith University v Tang     CLR      In my view s   of the NT Act  for the reasons I have given above  proceeds on the basis that a decision to accept for registration a native title claim under s   not only may  but must  be made before competing registered native title claimants in respect of the same claim area are notified of the competing claim  In Griffith University v Tang     CLR   Gummow  Callinan and Heydon JJ at     referred to there generally being a relationship between the questions of standing and  in the context of procedural fairness  the right to be heard  However  in my view s  a  makes it plain that in the normal course a competing registered native title claimant is not entitled to be given the opportunity to be heard when the Registrar is considering whether to accept for registration a native title determination application over the same area of land  The mere fact of having standing to challenge the Registrar s decision does not mean that the Town of Batchelor No   applicants were entitled to the opportunity to make submissions to the Registrar and to present material to him when he was considering such a decision   However  there are particular features in the present matter which take the position further  The Town of Batchelor No   applicants were in fact aware of the Town of Batchelor No   application  and that the Registrar would in due course consider whether to accept it for registration  The NLC  as the relevant representative body for the area covered by both applications  was entitled to be given a copy of the Town of Batchelor No   application and other documents relating to it pursuant to s  A  of the Act  That may be how the Town of Batchelor No   applicants came to learn of the later application  The NLC had certified the Town of Batchelor No   application  The solicitors acting for the NLC were the same solicitors as were acting for the Town of Batchelor No   applicants  Those solicitors had indicated a desire to make a submission to the Registrar on whether the Town of Batchelor No   application should be accepted for registration  There was then an e mail exchange between the Registrar by his officers and those solicitors on   December   in which it was acknowledged that such a submission was to be made  and that such a submission would be made after the proposed amendment to the Town of Batchelor No   application  The officer of the Registrar indicated that the time within which the submission should be made and material presented would be notified to the NLC once the amendments had been effected  I accept that  on the evidence  the proposed submission in opposition to the potential registration of the Town of Batchelor No   claim was delayed until after the proposed amendment of that claim and that the Registrar gave notification that the Registrar was considering whether to accept for registration the amended Town of Batchelor No   application  I also accept  as I have said above  that had such a submission been made it would have raised significant material for the Registrar s consideration relevant to whether the Town of Batchelor No   application should have been accepted for registration   It is that combination of particular circumstances which  in my view  gave rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of the Town of Batchelor No   applicants and an obligation on the part of the Registrar that he would give the NLC and its solicitors notification that he was considering whether to accept for registration the Town of Batchelor No   application and a time within which to take the opportunity to make submissions and to provide information in relation to it  I am mindful of the fact that relevant communications on   December   were between the solicitor for the Town of Batchelor No   applicants and for the NLC on the one hand  and an officer of the Registrar  but referred only to a submission from the NLC  In my view  there was such a coincidence of interest between the Town of Batchelor No   applicants and the NLC in the present circumstances  a coincidence which was apparent to the Registrar from the Town of Batchelor No   application having been certified by the NLC  that the opportunity to make a submission and to present additional information was one which was an entitlement to procedural fairness which covered both the NLC and the Town of Batchelor No   applicants   It is accepted that that opportunity was not provided by the Registrar   In my judgment  therefore  there was a failure to accord procedural fairness to the Town of Batchelor No   applicants in the particular circumstances before the decision was made by the Registrar to accept the Town of Batchelor No   application for registration  The nature of the submission  and additional information  which may have been provided in response to such an opportunity might have affected the outcome of the Registrar s decision   I accordingly propose to set aside the Registrar s decision on that ground      I will briefly refer to the other two grounds upon which the Registrar s decision is attacked referred toMartin v Native Title Registrar   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The Town of Batchelor No   applicants are entitled to provide additional material to the Registrar  in addition to that in the native title determination itself  to support the Registrar s satisfaction of the requirements of s  B  see Martin v Native Title Registrar   FCA     Section  A does not prevent a party producing in evidence the same material as that presented at a mediation  provided of course it is relevant  That is really self evident  If it were not so  no party could  for example  at a mediation refer to a statement of a proposed witness without the risk that that witness statement could not be adduced at a later hearing  Of course  the fact that that witness statement was referred to at the mediation could not be adduced at evidence at the hearing  Nor  generally  would it be relevant  What was improperly before the Registrar  if any error was made  was the fact that what he called  the FRBG Submissions  were presented at the mediation  But subject to their relevance  the FRBG Submissions could have been  and were  presented to the Registrar as material relevant to his satisfaction under s  B   And the Registrar simply recorded that he understood that material  to have been prepared for the purposes of mediation  in the Court  He did not receive material as to what was said at the mediation  or of anything there said  Had he actually received material that the FRBG Submissions were presented at the mediation  then s  A may have been infringed  But there was no apparent reliance by the Registrar upon the fact of their presentation to the mediation  so it would have been an error without consequence  The material apparently is of a factual and conclusory nature  and was equally eligible to be presented to the Registrar as to a mediator   It is not necessary to consider  therefore  whether the role of the Registrar in considering whether to accept for registration the Town of Batchelor No   application is a proceeding attracted by the scope of s  A b  of the Federal Court of Australia Act  citedCraig v South Australia   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The third principal contention of counsel for the Batchelor No   applicants is that the Registrar fell into error by identifying the wrong issue and asking himself the wrong question in addressing the procedural requirements in s  C  and    If that were made out  it would amount to reviewable error on the part of the Registrar  Craig v South Australia   HCA         CLR   at   followeddiscussedNorthern Territory of Australia v Doepel   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Section  C  requires the Registrar to be satisfied that the application contains all the details and other information  and is accompanied by any affidavit or other document  required by ss   and    That requires the Registrar to consider whether the requirements of ss   and   are met in the amended Town of Batchelor No   application  For the reasons I expressed in Northern Territory of Australia v Doepel   FCA         FCR   at         I do not think the Registrar was required to go beyond the application in considering if that requirement was satisfied  and in particular was not required to undertake some form of merit assessment of the material   The Registrar has worked through each of the requirements or elements of s   and s   of the Act  and assessed the application  that is the Town of Batchelor No   application  by reference to each of those requirements  That involved a careful consideration of the Town of Batchelor No   application and of the affidavits which accompanied it  as required by s  a   He concluded that the application contained all the details and other information  and was accompanied by the documents  required by ss   and    I have gone through the documents to which he referred  in the light of submissions by counsel for the Town of Batchelor No   applicants  In my view  the Registrar s conclusion was reasonably available to him  I do not think he is shown to have misunderstood the law or to have asked himself the wrong question in addressing the requirements of s  C    The gravamen of the contention on behalf of the Town of Batchelor No   applicants was more focused upon the requirements of s  C b   It provides that the Registrar must be satisfied that the Town of Batchelor No   applicants are members of the native title claim group and are authorised to make the application  and to deal with matters arising in relation to it  by all the persons in the native title claim group  The alternative provided by s  C a  was not available because the NLC as the relevant representative body had not certified the Town of Batchelor No   application under Pt   of the NT Act  The requirements of s  C b  are then further explained by s  C  which is in the following terms    If the application has not been certified as mentioned in paragraph  a  the Registrar cannot be satisfied that the condition in sub section   has been satisfied unless the application         a  includes a statement to the effect that the requirements set out in paragraph  b  has been met  and              b  briefly sets out the grounds on which the Registrar should consider that it has been met   The Registrar noted the definition of authorisation in s  B of the NT Act  He correctly identified that he was required to be satisfied of the matters set out in s  C b   He also identified the nature of that task as described in Doepel at    As he said  the NT Act places fundamental importance upon ensuring that claimant applications are properly authorised  see e g  Quall v Risk   FCA    The Registrar said that the necessary statements for s  C a  are made in the s   affidavits  There are affidavits pursuant to s   of the NT Act of May Stevens  Thomas Edward Petherick and Captain Wodidj adopting or using the words of s   of the NT Act  and therefore apparently providing a foundation for the Registrar s satisfaction that the requirement of s  D a  of the NT Act had been met  He then said that he was satisfied that there was material at Schedule R and in Attachments R  R  and R  to the Town of Batchelor No   application which met the requirements of s  C b  as that material
