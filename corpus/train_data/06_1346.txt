Dragan Vasiljkovic v Minister for Justice and Customsand Ors  with Corrigendum dated   October     FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlElliott v Seymour and Others   HCA         ALR   cited  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIt is an established principle that this Court usually will not interfere with the exercise of a discretion to prosecute  see Newby v Moodie and Another     ALR   at     Elliott v Seymour and Others   HCA         ALR   at    Such principle has been applied to proceedings under the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act    Cth  see Yates v Wilson and Others at   where Mason CJ said       The undesirability of fragmenting the criminal process is so powerful a consideration that it requires no elaboration by us  It is a factor that should inhibit the Federal Court from exercising jurisdiction under the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act            It has also been applied to extradition proceedings  see Wiest v Director of Public Prosecutions and Another     ALR   at     Peniche v Hannan   Harris   In Harris the Full Court said at page      Whilst the present application was made under the Judiciary Act rather than the AD JR  Act  the foregoing considerations suggest that  as Davies J pointed out in Wiest v Director of Public Prosecutions     ALR    at     there are sound reasons of policy why the Court should be reluctant to intervene at an intermediate stage of the extradition process  in the absence of an exceptional situation  for instance the determination of a discrete point of law on uncontested facts  cf Elliott v Seymour     ALJR   per Gaudron J at   Jarrett v Seymour     FCR   per Lockhart and Beaumont JJ at      Dragan submitted that it would be more convenient for the Issues to be determined separately to the magistrate s hearing  However  in Elliott v Seymour and Others Gaudron J at   said           an order preventing the institution of criminal proceedings would only be made in exceptional cases and  as will later appear  the matters which would make a case exceptional would  almost inevitably  outweigh considerations of convenience    A finding to the same effect was made by the Full Court in Jarrett v Seymour and Others     ALR   at   where it said     As the primary judge recognised  it is well settled that an exceptional case must be made out in order that this court should intervene in the criminal process  by way of judicial review  There is no reason to depart from these principles which apply with equal force to extradition proceedings  Contrary to Dragan s submission  the Court is satisfied that a hearing of the issues prior to the magistrates decision  would offend the anti fragmentation principle  For the above reasons  this Court is satisfied that its discretion should be exercised against determining the Issues  and the Court will adjourn Dragan s application to this Court  In reaching this decision the Court makes no finding upon the merits of Dragan s submissions Harris v Attorney General of the Commonwealth and Another     FCR   followed  The Minister also submits that in accordance with established authority  the Court  in the exercise of its discretion  should not permit the fragmentation of the criminal process by determining the Issues pending the magistrate s hearing  The Minister relies upon several authorities including Harris v Attorney General of the Commonwealth and Another     FCR   Peniche v Hannan   FCA     Yates v Wilson and Others     CLR   Forsyth v United Kingdom   FCA     and submits that they demonstrate a strong presumption against interference with the statutory extradition process  It is an established principle that this Court usually will not interfere with the exercise of a discretion to prosecute  see Newby v Moodie and Another     ALR   at     Elliott v Seymour and Others   HCA         ALR   at    Such principle has been applied to proceedings under the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act    Cth  see Yates v Wilson and Others at   where Mason CJ said       The undesirability of fragmenting the criminal process is so powerful a consideration that it requires no elaboration by us  It is a factor that should inhibit the Federal Court from exercising jurisdiction under the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act            It has also been applied to extradition proceedings  see Wiest v Director of Public Prosecutions and Another     ALR   at     Peniche v Hannan   Harris   In Harris the Full Court said at page      Whilst the present application was made under the Judiciary Act rather than the AD JR  Act  the foregoing considerations suggest that  as Davies J pointed out in Wiest v Director of Public Prosecutions     ALR    at     there are sound reasons of policy why the Court should be reluctant to intervene at an intermediate stage of the extradition process  in the absence of an exceptional situation  for instance the determination of a discrete point of law on uncontested facts  cf Elliott v Seymour     ALJR   per Gaudron J at   Jarrett v Seymour     FCR   per Lockhart and Beaumont JJ at      Metwally v University of Wollongong   HCA         ALR   cited  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAs a separate consideration the Minister says that the Court should not permit a second application to be made for habeas corpus when Dragan has already brought proceedings in the High Court of Australia for habeas corpus and the relief now sought from this Court could have been raised before that Court  The Minister relies upon Metwally v University of Wollongong   HCA         ALR   in support of the submission that Dragan s application should be refused on this discretionary ground  Dragan opposes the adjournment and submits that a determination of the Issues prior to the magistrate s hearing would decide whether the Geneva Conventions operate to the exclusion of the Regulations  Such determination would resolve the question of Dragan s eligibility for surrender  In response to the Minister s submission that the Issues could have been brought in the High Court proceedings  Dragan submits that the Minister could have raised such questions  and submits that the principle in Metwally has no application  Dragan relies upon Regina v Governor of Brixton Prison  Ex parte Osmon  No        WLR   at   as authority for the principle that the raising of a new legal argument late in proceedings for habeas corpus does not amount to an abuse of process  Dragan s claim for relief arises pursuant to the Act  Accordingly  this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the claim for relief under s  B A c  of the Judiciary Act    Cth   The essential question is whether such jurisdiction should  in the Court s discretion  be exercised  Part II of the Act establishes the procedure to be followed when an application for extradition has been made  It commences with the issue of a provisional arrest warrant  s   the remand before a magistrate before execution of the warrant  s   the issue of the notice by the Attorney General pursuant to s   the determination of eligibility for surrender as provided by s    A party wishing to challenge the magistrate s decision is entitled to seek judicial review as provided by s   of the Act  Since the Court has already determined to grant the adjournment sought  it is not necessary to deal with the submission of the Minister based on Metwally     I certify that the preceding thirty four   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the
