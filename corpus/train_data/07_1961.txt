 Echo Bay Mines Ltd v R     CF   a Canadian Trial Court decision  was cited but was of little assistance  It was a case concerned with the calculation of income tax  The Court there held that the

circumstances where the plaintiff participated in forward sales contracts and settlements  however  as a hedge against price fluctuations in silver  and in which the commodity traded was silver futures  I do not conclude that the plaintiff was involved in futures speculation for investment purposes  There was a clear business purpose in its sales and settlement of silver futures contracts  a purpose integrated with its sales of product to yield income  the plaintiff was trying to obtain an assured price for the sale of the silver it produced          Here the forward sales transactions were in respect of the same commodity as the plaintiff s production  both were  in my view  integral aspects of the plaintiff s business of producing silver  and returns from these activities were

ct  html  One of the cases cited was Australian Gas Light Company v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCA         FCR   in which I said  at     Although there are some loose  but not entirely appropriate  analogies between the derivative contract and a form of insurance in my opinion  for present purposes  the derivative contracts ought to be regarded as an integral part of the pricing and payment arrangements between generators and retailers in relation to the underlying product  which is electrical energy  and which they deal with  as if  it had been sold from supplier to retailer     That observation was made in a statutory context quite different from the present  The case was concerned with whether a proposed acquisition of an interest in an electricity base load generator by an electricity retailer would have  or be likely to have  the effect of substantially lessening competition in a market in Australia  The question of the relationship between derivative contracts and sale of the relevant commodity which  in that case was electricity  was relevant to the question whether there were separate markets to be considered  one for the purchase and sale of derivatives and the other for the sale of electricity  The observation which was quoted from the judgment in that case reflects what Professor Garnaut had to say about the way in which an economist would regard hedging expenses in relation to sales  For the reasons which I have already outlined in discussing his evidence  that kind of equation does not assist in the construction of s  a  and  b

FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Professor Ross Garnaut is Professor of Economics at the Australian National University  By a letter dated   October   he was requested by the solicitors for Woodside Energy to provide his expert opinion in relation to a dispute concerning the appropriate treatment of hedge expenses under the PRRTAA  He produced a report  responsive to a number of questions put to him by the solicitors  The report was exhibited to his affidavit of   March    Professor Garnaut s evidence was the subject of a ruling as to admissibility in an interlocutory decision published on   October   Woodside Energy Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCR    Under the terms of that ruling it was received subject to relevance   Professor Garnaut served as Principal Economic Advisor to the Prime Minister  Mr RJL Hawke  from   to    From   to   he was Australian Ambassador to the People s Republic of China  He did not occupy any economic advisory role with respect to government when the PRRTAA was enacted in    It appears also that he had no part in the preparation of drafting instructions in relation to the legislation   The questions posed for consideration by Professor Garnaut began by asking for an  economic perspective  on what is conveyed by the description of a tax as a  resource rent tax   He was asked to identify  from an economic perspective  the features and objectives of such a tax distinguishing it from royalty or excise regimes  He was asked about the relationship between the term  economic rent  and the profit of a particular resource project in respect of which RRT is payable  Against the background of those questions there were then five specific questions put relating to the hedging losses claimed by Woodside Energy  They were as follows           On the assumption that PRRT is intended to be a tax on  economic rent  would an economist make allowance for amounts received and expenses incurred on the hedging activities undertaken by Woodside in relation to the Laminaria project  as described in the Woodside affidavits  in measuring the amount upon which PRRT is to be levied in relation to the Laminaria project         Would an economist regard the expenses incurred by Woodside in relation to the hedging transactions described in the Woodside affidavits as expenses payable in relation to the sale of petroleum produced from the Laminaria project       Is there any reason why an economist would treat hedging expenses differently from interest paid in respect of monies borrowed for the purposes of assessing economic rent or the amount upon which to levy PRRT       In your opinion  can the hedge expenses incurred by Woodside in relation to the Laminaria project  as described in the Woodside affidavits  be described from an economic point of view as marginal costs associated with the Laminaria project  You should explain what is meant by the description of a cost as a  marginal cost         If one failed to take into account the hedge expenses incurred by Woodside in relation to the Laminaria project  as described in the Woodside affidavits  in measuring the economic rent or the amount upon which to levy PRRT  what would be the consequences of such a failure in terms of meeting or failing to meet the objectives of a resource rent tax  As I said in the interlocutory decision in Woodside Energy   FCA       FCR   at   the words  in relation to  and similar terms such as  in respect of  or  in connection with  or just  in  have been considered in many cases and many
