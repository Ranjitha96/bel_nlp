Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Carlisle Homes Pty Ltd   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedBarrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Barrett has recently successfully sued another home builder for copyright infringement in respect of the Seattle design  Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd   FCA    In that case Gilmour J has comprehensively reviewed copyright law principles as applicable to home designs  see especially at      I gratefully adopt that review and incorporate it in these reasons   Barrett s Seattle design is Schedule A to these reasons   Carlisle s Provence design is Schedule B to these reasons   In Metricon subsistence of Barrett s copyright in the Seattle was not challenged  However  Gilmour J noted at     The drawing process  as evidenced in  Barrett s  affidavit material  shows a substantial evolution in the design concept and implementation  which is clearly revealed in the sequence of drawings exhibited  There are approximately   drawings and notes that culminate in the final Seattle   plan  which Barrett approved in or about September      Carlisle disputed that there were   drawings in evidence in the present case  My calculation accords with that of Gilmour J  There may well be some duplication  with the same drawing being reproduced by sender and receiver  But I am satisfied that the general conclusion reached by Gilmour J is equally justified in the present case   By September   Barrett was building the first prototype of the Seattle design at   Brownell Road  Glen Iris  as a home for Mr Roberts  About this time it commenced marketing  building and selling houses in accordance with the Seattle plan  The product was available in     or   square versions  The first display home was built and opened at a display village located at   Scenic Drive  Beaconsfield in January     The Seattle design proved to be popular and sold very well   In Metricon at     Gilmour J applied those principles and held that the al fresco quadrant was a substantial part of the Seattle and Memphis designs  I respectfully agree with his Honour s conclusion and reasoning  which I would have arrived at independently  for the following reasons   In visual terms  Gilmour J at   described the impression presented by the al fresco as built    The layout of the Seattle   gave the impression of a free flowing design  leading from the hallway to the hub of the home  with the al fresco quadrant  under one roof line  being central to the design  The impression was reinforced by the open plan kitchen that looked over the living and al fresco areas  The design allowed one to view into the rumpus room which enhanced the free flowing design features of the Seattle   plan  These features were clearly based in a communal area of the plan  so as to optimise appreciation of the al fresco quadrant and surrounding living areas  Based on my impression  I would describe the al fresco quadrant as being substantial in a qualitative sense   That accords with my impression appliedBriginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Further  I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities  while having regard to the seriousness of such a finding  see Briginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR     that Messrs Doulgeridis  Taylor and Morrison gave consciously untrue evidence when they said that the Rochester was mentioned at the Mallesons conference  It inevitably follows that they must have colluded in so doing   Although I am not aware of any consideration in civil cases of the probative effect of lies  the probative logic remains the same  see Evidence Act    Cth  s     subject of course always to the application of a different standard of proof with the Briginshaw qualification   In the present case  the most likely explanation for Messrs Doulgeridis  Taylor and Morrison telling lies about what was said at the Mallesons conference is that they realised that the failure to mention the Rochester would tend to show that Rochester was not the true source of their Provence design  If they invented an untrue source  the most likely explanation for that is that they knew the source alleged by Barrett was the true one   The evidence points to the following conclusion  which I find  Mr Doulgeridis did copy the al fresco quadrant from Barrett s Seattle plan  which had been on the market for several years  Probably he did so without much thought and assumed  because the plan had been around for a while  that it was in the public domain  especially in Western Australia  When challenged  the Carlisle directors first raised the argument that the al fresco was commonplace and devoid of originality  The initial versions of the defence reflect this  When the directors were unable to produce any concrete examples of the design pre dating the Streeton  they fell back on the Rochester argument  When faced with the difficulty that there was no record of mentioning the Rochester on the first opportunity to do so  they falsely claimed that they did   As already mentioned  Carlisle s evidence of the alleged design history included three sketches  and in particular the sketch subsequently identified as Sketch C  The mere existence of the sketches does not rule out Mr Doulgeridis having produced them by copying the Seattle  Given the false Rochester story I am unable to be satisfied as to the truth of any positive case advanced by Carlisle as to the design history of the Provence appliedClarendon Homes  Aust  Pty Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd     IPR   In Tamawood their Honours did not refer to the earlier Full Court decision in Clarendon Homes  Aust  Pty Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd     IPR    This appears to have been a  substantial part  case  see at    In any event  the Full Court said at     Further  in a case where there has been deliberate copying  the court will not look kindly on a defendant when the plaintiff seeks to establish that what has been copied is sufficiently objectively similar to the plaintiff s work  In Blackie   Sons Ltd v The Lothian Book Publishing Co Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   Starke J said at         It is not for the court to make the way of the taker of copyright matter easy  It is a sound principle of copyright law that the court should not allow one man to take away the result  of another man s labour  or  in other words  his property  unless it is satisfied that the part taken is  so slight  and the effect upon the total composition was so small   as to render the taking perfectly immaterial  or what is much the same thing  that the part taken is an unsubstantial part   Citations

Woolley Pty Ltd v Hooker Homes Pty Ltd     NSWLR   where his Honour acknowledged that his finding of infringement had been coloured by the unmeritorious use made by the defendant of the plaintiff s work   The Full Court in Clarendon later at   made it clear that a finding of deliberate copying was not conclusive  Objective similarity remains to be proved  Their Honours said      But copying can be both conscious and unconscious  When copying is deliberate then  so it seems  the Court is permitted to show greater latitude in the plaintiff s favour  We accept this approach should not be taken too far  In a given case there either is or is not sufficient objective similarity to make out infringement  It will only be when the trial judge regards the position as finely balanced that he should err in favour of the plaintiff if the conduct complained of is deliberate    I shall follow that approach appliedEagle Homes Pty Ltd v Austec Homes Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR  http www austlii edu au

cautioned against this practice in Designers Guild   appliedEdwards v The Queen   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In the criminal law there is extensive jurisprudence as to the evidentiary use that can be made of lies  The leading case is Edwards v The Queen   HCA         CLR    Deane  Dawson and Gaudron JJ  after noting that ordinarily the telling of a lie will merely affect the credit of the witness who tells it  said at     It is only if the accused is telling a lie because he perceives that the truth is inconsistent with his innocence that the telling of the lie may constitute evidence against him  In other words  in telling the lie the accused must be acting as if he were guilty  It must be a lie which an innocent person would not tell  That is why the lie must be deliberate  Telling an untruth inadvertently cannot be indicative of guilt  And the lie must relate to a material issue because the telling of it must be explicable only on the basis that the truth would implicate the accused in the offence for which he is charged  It must be for that reason that he tells the lie  To say that the lie must spring from the realization or consciousness of guilt is really another way of saying the same thing  It is to say that the accused must be lying because he is conscious that  if he tells the truth  the truth will convict him    Citations omitted  referred toKipling v Genatosan Ltd     MacG Cop Cas   First  in purely quantitative terms  which is relevant  although not of course conclusive  the al fresco quadrant is about a third of the total floor area  Less may be sufficient  a defendant who took four of the   lines of Rudyard Kipling s If in an advertisement for a  reviver of nerve power  was held to have taken a substantial part  Kipling v Genatosan Ltd     MacG Cop Cas     More importantly  the al fresco quadrant is an essential part of the house  something that Le Corbusier characterised as  a machine for living in    Vers une architecture      Potential buyers would recognise the al fresco quadrant as a part of the house where they and their family would spend most of their waking hours  Thus the al fresco quadrant had a commercial significance  as the evidence demonstrated appliedTamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd     IPR   The historical background and authoritative judicial interpretation of the substantial part requirement  in the context of a building design dispute  are comprehensively reviewed by Wilcox and Lindgren JJ in Tamawood Ltd v Henley Arch Pty Ltd     IPR   at       Counsel for Carlisle submitted that the al fresco quadrant  was the product of negligible or trivial skill  labour and effort   For the reasons given in relation to the subsistence issue  I reject this submission  see Tamawood at       Counsel also argued that by the time the Provence was designed in   the al fresco quadrant had become commonplace  However  the relevant time for assessing the  substantial part  question is when the Seattle was designed  that is in    If that were not so  copyright owners would lose their rights provided a sufficient number of infringements had been perpetrated   I find that the al fresco quadrant was a substantial part of Barrett s designs and buildings   A finding of subjective copying is relevant to the issue of sufficient similarity  In Eagle

Woolley Pty Ltd v Hooker Homes Pty Ltd     NSWLR   where his Honour acknowledged that his finding of infringement had been coloured by the unmeritorious use made by the defendant of the plaintiff s work   Counsel for Carlisle relied on the proposition that the more simple  commonplace  familiar and straight forward the subject matter of a copyright work  the closer the similarity that will be required if infringement is to be found  Tamawood at    He cited the well known case of Kenrick   Co v Lawrence   Co     QBD   at     a case which concerned the representation of a hand making the mark of a cross on a ballot paper   This proposition  while undoubtedly correct  is of little assistance in the present case  Barrett s al fresco quadrant was truly original and commercially successful  Nor is it to the point  as counsel for Carlisle argued  that there are differences elsewhere between the Provence and the Barrett designs  such as in respect of the front facades  The fact that this is a  substantial part  case necessarily means that there are other parts of Carlisle s works in respect of which there is no allegation of copying   Barrett s expert witness Dr John Cooke compared the Seattle plan to the Provence plan  He said    The rear part of the  Provence  plan  containing Kitchen  Meals  Family  Alfresco  Rumpus  Bed   Bed   Bed   Laundry  Bath  WC  Laundry and Pantry is essentially very similar in layout  mirror reversed  to the corresponding area in the Seattle plan  with differences in the arrangement of wet areas and angled doors to Bed   and Bed   instead of the doors at right angles to the corridor in the Seattle plan      The main difference in this part of the plans is the shape of the Kitchen and the access to the Laundry  direct from the Kitchen in the Respondent s Plan  from the bedroom corridor in the Seattle Plan   The position of the Laundry access in the Respondent s Plan has enabled the bedroom corridor to be shortened   In comparing the respective houses  Dr Cooke said      The vista from the Entry in the  Carlisle house   Photograph No   is closed by a recessed and top lit wall feature  whereas the corresponding vista in the Seattle  Photograph No   is closed by an aperture in the wall beside the Rumpus room doorway and the doorway of the Rumpus room itself  The Rumpus room doorway is visible in this vista because the rear part of the plan of the  Carlisle house  is a mirror reversed version of the Seattle plan  with the result that the Entry access leads to the Rumpus room doorway in the Seattle whereas in the  Carlisle house  the Rumpus room is to the right of the Entry access      However the spatial effects in both houses are similar   He concluded      Overall  in my opinion the arrangement of the Alfresco and surrounding living areas  including the indoor outdoor connection and the Alfresco space itself is a highly significant feature of both houses  reference to photographs  as is the organization of the circulation areas to minimize waste and maximize virtual impact
