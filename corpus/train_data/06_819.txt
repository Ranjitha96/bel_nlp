Egglishaw v Australian Crime Commission   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlapprovedA  v Australian Crime Commission   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The issues that fall for determination are    the applicant s attack on the warrant on the same grounds as those dealt with by Young J in A  v Australian Crime Commission   FCA    the A  point    his attack on the procedure by which the Commission obtained the notebook  and    his attack on the procedure by which the Commission obtained the DVDs   The A  point can be disposed of shortly  Mr Lucarelli QC for the applicant said   The parties  are  content     to     simply rely upon  their  written submissions and the decision  in  A  with the statement by the applicant that A  is wrong  But the applicant understands     that your Honour may well be persuaded by what  was  said in A  and that your Honour is naturally entitled to follow A       although the applicant  says  that A  is wrong and that your Honour ought not follow it      I have read A  and the parties  written submissions   The applicant has put no contention to me that was not put to Young J in A  or  more importantly  explained why his Honour s treatment thereof was deficient  In those circumstances  I cannot see how I could be convinced that his Honour was clearly or plainly wrong in A

the decision in Ryder to reject that argument   I should address the question of who bears the burden of proof before I turn to the second and third matters set out at   followedWilliams v Keelty   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In Williams v Keelty   FCA         FCR   at   and   Hely J said   The applicants contend that the onus of proving the warrants were lawfully issued falls upon ASIC  Reliance was placed upon the decision of Heerey J in Challenge Plastics Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs  Vic   No       FCR    Heerey J said  at            Generally speaking  administrative acts are presumed to be valid and the onus is on the party seeking to challenge them      However  here we have a rather special situation of an entry on premises and removal of documents without the consent of the owner of the premises and documents  Without lawful justification  such conduct would constitute a trespass  In substance  this proceeding has been concerned with the legal justification advanced by the respondent for that action  Where the exercise of executive discretion interferes with liberty or property rights  once the person affected has shown a prima facie case the burden of justifying the legality of the decision is on the executive  R v Secretary of State for Home Department  Ex parte Khawaja   UKHL       AC   at   per Lord Scarman           I agree that once the applicants show an invasion of their property or premises by ASIC  the onus is upon ASIC to adduce evidence  and to persuade the trier of fact that its invasion of what would otherwise be the applicants  rights was undertaken with lawful justification  But ASIC discharges that onus by the production of the search warrants  and by demonstrating that its actions were within the scope of the authority conferred by the warrants  If the applicants wish to challenge the issue of the warrants on administrative law grounds  then the onus is on them to make good that challenge  This result is consistent with the decision of the Full Court in Malubel  Pty Ltd  v Elder     FCR   at   where the Court held that the issue of a warrant is an administrative act  and steps taken pursuant to it may be presumed to be valid unless and until the warrant is set aside  The observations of Gummow J in Ousley v The Queen     HCA       CLR   at     are to like effect      The emphasis is mine   This approach was approved by Branson J in Kennedy v Baker   FCA         FCR   at   and     And see X v Australian Crime Commission   FCA         FCR   at   per Finn J   Like Branson J  I think it  the correct approach    The Commission has discharged the onus described by Hely J  The warrant was adduced into evidence by Ms McClure s affidavit  and the notice by Mr Andrew s affidavit  Further  it is not the applicant s case that the Commission s actions were outside the scope of the authority conferred by the warrant and the notice  The applicant s case is described at   and     Section  F of the Crimes Act relevantly provides    A warrant that is in force in relation to premises authorises the executing officer or a constable assisting               c  to search the premises for the kinds of evidential material specified in the warrant  and to seize things of that kind found at the premises              The expression  evidential material  is defined in s  C as  a thing relevant to an indictable offence or a thing relevant to a summary offence  including such a thing in electronic form   The expression  a thing relevant to an indictable offence  is defined in s   as       a  either of the following             i  anything with respect to which an indictable offence against any law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory has been committed or is suspected  on reasonable grounds  to have been committed     ii  anything with respect to which a State offence that has a federal aspect  and that is an indictable offence against the law of that State  has been committed or is suspected  on reasonable grounds  to have been committed  or            b  anything as to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that it will afford evidence as to the commission of any such offence  or    c  anything as to which there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that it is intended to be used for the purpose of committing any such offence        The emphasis is mine   Section  K relevantly provides          The executing officer or constable assisting may bring to the warrant premises any equipment reasonably necessary for the examination or processing of a thing found at the premises in order to determine whether it is a thing that may be seized under the warrant      A thing found at the premises may be moved to another place for examination or processing in order to determine whether it may be seized under a warrant if             a  both of the following apply           i  it is significantly more practicable to do so having regard to the timeliness and cost of examining or processing the thing at another place and the availability of expert assistance     ii  there are reasonable grounds to believe that the thing contains or constitutes evidential material                The emphasis is mine  approvedKennedy v Baker   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In Williams v Keelty

FCR   at   per Finn J   Like Branson J  I think it  the correct approach  consideredChairman  National Crime Authority v Flack     ALR   By his written submissions in reply  the applicant contends that   The applicant  was required to produce a thing which was not in his  custody  possession and or control  in the requisite sense   In circumstances where         a  the notice     required the production of the     DVDs  forthwith     b   the applicant  was afforded no opportunity to verify the contents of the DVDs  and    c   the applicant  was handed the     DVDs at a time when his presence at the  Commission s  offices was involuntary       possession of the  thing  did not pass to  the applicant       The emphases are in the original   The applicant also cites Chairman  National Crime Authority v Flack     ALR   as discussing the relevant authorities   The Commission does not dispute the facts set out in sub paras  a  to  c  of the passage quoted above   The applicant s contentions in the passage quoted at   are fundamentally unsound  The qualification of  custody  possession and or control  by  the requisite sense  begs the question of what that sense is  The terms of the notice are clear  There is no reason to read them down  In the events that occurred  possession however fleeting of the DVDs passed to the applicant when they were handed to him  It is beside the point that they were created by the Commission and handed to him in the knowledge or with the intention that he would immediately thereafter be compelled by way of the notice to hand them back  Until he was so compelled he was in possession of them  It is also beside the point that he was not in possession of them when the notice was issued as opposed to when the notice was served on him  As far as he was concerned  the notice was a dead letter unless and until it was served on him   The authorities discussed in Flack avail the applicant nothing  They include the  finding  cases of Bridges v Hawkesworth     LJQB   South Staffordshire Water Company v Sharman     QB   and Parker v British Airways Board     QB    This is not a  finding  case  The DVDs were handed to the applicant at the Commission s offices  The question whether the Commission intended to exercise control over its offices to the extent that it owns things found therein by strangers simply does not arise for determination discussedPuglisi v Australian Fisheries Management Authority     ALR   The Commission referred to the decision of Hill J in Puglisi v Australian Fisheries Management Authority     ALR   at   and    In that case  material had been  seized  at two premises  However  those  seizures  were defective  In order to remedy those defects  the material was returned to the respective premises and  re seized   At   his Honour said   At the premises at Bungo Street the goods which had been seized were brought into the house and then re seized  However  at   Parson Street the seized goods remained in the police vehicle stationary in the driveway and Mr Puglisi s wife was asked to come out to the vehicle and identify the material  The material was  re seized  while it was still in the vehicle     and driven away      At   his Honour said     In my view the items that were in the Federal Police car were never  found  at the Parson Street premises in the course of a search  Nor were they ever then  seized   The items were always in the possession of the     Federal Police and in the car  In my view it would be a misuse of language to speak of items always in the possession of the     Federal Police as being  found  at premises merely because they are in a car owned by the Federal Police parked in the premises  Nor can items held by the     Federal Police be seized by the Federal Police from the Federal Police      Clearly  the situation in the instant proceeding was different from that in Puglisi   The DVDs were handed back to the applicant  That is analogous to the situation at the Bungo Street premises rather than that at the Parson Street premises referred to above   The fact that the applicant was not afforded an opportunity to verify that the DVDs  contents matched their description in the notice does not detract from the fact that he was in possession of the DVDs at time the notice was served on him  Only if the DVDs  contents did not match their description would the notice have been defective because it compelled the applicant to produce  forthwith  a thing that was not in his  custody  possession and or control    The fact that the applicant was served with the notice during his involuntary attendance at the Commission s offices is neither here nor there citedBridges v Hawkesworth     LJQB   The authorities discussed in Flack avail the applicant nothing  They include the  finding  cases of Bridges v Hawkesworth     LJQB   South Staffordshire Water Company v Sharman     QB   and Parker v British Airways Board     QB    This is not a  finding  case  The DVDs were handed to the applicant at the Commission s offices  The question whether the Commission intended to exercise control over its offices to the extent that it owns

determination notfollowedJones v Dunkel   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Commission did not adduce evidence that the examiner was satisfied in the requisite sense  That lack of evidence is unexceptionable because the applicant failed to adduce evidence that the examiner was not so satisfied and first raised the issue of whether or not the examiner was so satisfied on the day the hearing of the application commenced  For those reasons    it is not appropriate for me to draw an inference of the sort described by Windeyer J in Jones v Dunkel   HCA         CLR   at     from the Commission s failure to adduce evidence from Messrs Hellings or Goodchild whose roles in the procurement of the notice are described at  d  or the examiner  and    I need not deal with the applicant s contention that the examiner could not have been satisfied in the requisite sense when he issued the notice because he must have known that the Commission created the DVDs and or that the applicant was not  at that point in time  in  custody  possession and or control  of the DVDs followedJohnson v Williams     ALD   For the above reasons  I would dismiss the application with costs  Further  if I am wrong in any of those reasons  I would  in the exercise of my discretion  refuse to grant the relief sought  In Johnson v Williams     ALD   at   and   the Full Court of this Court said   One matter that is properly to be taken into account in proceedings to quash or have declared invalid an administrative decision is whether there has been delay in bringing the proceeding  Courts quite properly take the view that there is a need for a speedy determination of the validity of an administrative decision  The interests of good administration and third parties are at stake  O Reilly v Mackman   UKHL         AC   at   Caswell v Dairy Produce Quota Tribunal for England   Wales   UKHL         AC    Unreasonable or unaccounted for delay cannot be tolerated      The timely action that is required is the commencement of proceedings for or in the nature of judicial review      The emphasis is mine   In that case  the relief sought from and refused by the primary judge was an order to quash a decision of the Attorney General to refuse to withdraw a request for extradition   In the present case  the warrant was issued on   February   and executed the following day  The notice was issued and served on   February    The application was filed on   December   over   months after the events that gave rise to it occurred  The applicant has failed to explain his inordinate delay in commencing proceedings  His attempt to do so by the affidavit of Philip Cadman  of his solicitors  fails  Mr Cadman deposed that   The     warrant     and the     notice     form part of a clandestine investigation conducted in circumstances of confidentiality and secrecy  Prior to the  Commission  releasing details of actions taken in the course of their investigations      by way of certain press releases issued in June   and exhibited to Mr Andrew s affidavit  it was not possible for the applicant or any other members of the public to be aware that materials outside the scope of the warrant and the notice     were being acted on by the  Commission       Apart from being hearsay  this is beside the point  The applicant complains that the Commission s exercise of coercive power in the form of a substantial interference with his personal property was unlawful because it was done pursuant to an unlawful warrant and notice  What happened afterwards is irrelevant to the basis upon which that complaint is made  At most  it merely to put it colloquially raised the stakes for the applicant in his attempt to impugn the warrant and the notice   In any case  Mr Cadman s evidence is contradicted by other evidence adduced by the applicant  Michael Carr  of other solicitors for the applicant  deposed that on   February   a member of the Commission advised the applicant in the presence of himself and Mr Galbally QC who appeared for the applicant before me that   the investigation being conducted by the  Commission  would be broadened to include other persons who the applicant had dealings with  as identified in correspondence contained on the applicant s computer  and  stated words to the     effect  that   t here will be another search warrant       It is neither here nor there that no such warrant was obtained citedMalone v Metropolitan Police Commissioner   QB   In the circumstances  I need not deal with the Commission s alternative submission that  if the applicant had made out a case for relief  I should not order the return of the information obtained pursuant to the warrant and the notice or prohibit its use  so as to preserve it for use in foreshadowed criminal proceedings pending a determination of the trial judge therein as to whether or not it should be excluded on the grounds that it was unlawfully obtained  See for example Malone v Metropolitan Police Commissioner   QB   and Parker v Churchill     FCR   citedParker v Churchill     FCR   In the circumstances  I need not deal with the Commission
