Court of Australia Act    Cth   In Bird v Free and Others     ALR   at   Drummond J said of s   of the latter Act    The original jurisdiction of the court is exercised by a single judge  s    But when a single judge hears an application that invokes the jurisdiction of the Federal Court  he or she is not exercising an authority vested in him or her as an individual  but rather the authority which is vested in that judge and all the other judges of the court  as a group citedCheesman and Others v Waters and Another     ALR   In making the orders for substituted service upon the applicant  Registrar Segal was exercising the power of the court provided by ss   and  b  of the FMA  A Registrar of the Federal Magistrates Court has power to make orders pursuant to the FMC Bankruptcy Rules  see Cheesman and Others v Waters and Another     ALR     Although the applicant claimed that no direction had been issued authorising a Registrar to exercise the power of the court as prescribed by reg    A  of the FMC Rules  a delegation for such purpose has been made pursuant to the Federates Magistrates  Delegations to Registrars  Approval    the Delegations  on   May    Pursuant to the Delegations each Registrar referred to in Sch   thereof is approved to exercise powers under s  a  to  i  of the FMA including the powers mentioned in Sch   of the FMC Bankruptcy Rules  as prescribed by r     of those Rules  Registrar Segal is nominated in Sch     Pursuant to the Federal Magistrates Court  Bankruptcy  Direction    the Bankruptcy Direction  it was directed that the powers referred to in Sch   of the FMC Bankruptcy Rules may be exercised by a Registrar  The Delegations thus complete the authority provided to Registrars by Sch   of the FMC Bankruptcy Rules appliedHarris v Caladine   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Harris v Caladine   HCA         CLR   the High Court held that a court created under s   of the Constitution may  if so authorised  delegate the exercise of its judicial functions to an officer of the court provided that the exercise of that power is subject to review  Such review must be by way of a hearing de novo by a Justice or Judge of the court in accordance with s   of the Constitution  see Mason CJ and Deane J at     Pursuant to s   of the FMA Registrars of the Federal Magistrates Court may be appointed as officers of the Federal Magistrates Court  Subsection   of the FMA provides that a party to proceedings in which a Registrar has exercised any of the powers of the Federal Magistrates Court pursuant to subs   or subs   of the FMA may apply to the Federal Magistrates Court for review of that exercise of power  Such provisions thereby satisfy the requirements of the delegational functions referred to in Harris v Caladine  citedJoye v Beach Petroleum NL and Another     FCR   Under s  b  of the FMA a Registrar has the power to make orders  in relation to substituted service    The use of the

applicant submits that s   of the FMA requires that the Federal Magistrates Court consist of a Chief Federal Magistrate and Federal Magistrates  but does not include Registrars  The applicant relies upon Kotsis v Kotsis   HCA         CLR   and Knight v Knight   HCA         CLR   in support of its submissions that the Registrar of the Federal Magistrates Court cannot exercise the powers of that court   In Kotsis v Kotsis the High Court determined that a Deputy Registrar of a State Supreme court had no power to make an order for costs  Windeyer J observed at      Nevertheless I think that when any court is authorized to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth the power of adjudication thus committed to it must be exercised by the whole court or by a judge of the court  not by a subordinate officer    The same principle was applied in Knight v Knight    Kotsis v Kotsis and Knight v Knight related to the power of a court official to make an order of an adjudicative nature  These decisions  however  are not relevant to the exercise of an administrative function by a Registrar of the Federal Magistrates Court  The issue of a bankruptcy notice and orders for its service

 The applicant also submits that the decision of the High Court of Australia  the High Court  in Re Bryant  Ex parte Guarino   HCA         ALJR     which upheld the constitutional validity of the appointment of Federal Magistrates  was made  without the assistance of counsel  and under the pressure of a hearing the next day    The applicant submits that the issue under consideration in that case  namely whether the appointment of Federal Magistrates by Parliament is constitutional  is one of public importance and should be reconsidered by either the Full Court or the High Court   The Federal Magistrates Court is a court created pursuant to the power contained in s   of the Constitution   and s   of the Constitution permits Parliament to make laws defining the jurisdiction of any federal court it has created  The Federal Magistrates Court exercises the judicial power of the Commonwealth invested under Ch III of the Constitution   Section   of the FMA invests the Federal Magistrates Court with such original jurisdiction as is vested in it by laws made by Parliament either by express provision or by application of s  C of the Acts Interpretation Act    Cth   The Federal Magistrates Court is a court of record and is a court of the law and equity  see subs   of the FMA    The Federal Magistrates Court is to be constituted  for the purpose of the exercise of its jurisdiction  by a single Federal Magistrate as provided by s    Section   of the Constitution refers to judges as being those who are entitled to exercise federal jurisdiction  However  as held in Re Bryant  Ex parte Guarino by Hayne J the title of the judicial officer of  magistrate  as referred to in s   of the FMA is of no consequence  His Honour said at     Nevertheless  it is clear when regard is had to s   and the power given to the Parliament to create  other Federal courts  that the title given to the judicial officer    is not determinative of the constitutional reach of s   and the other provisions in Ch III  The constitutional reach of s   extends to the Federal Magistrates appointed to serve in the court created by the Parliament by the Act   Re Bryant  Ex parte Guarino determined that the Commonwealth possesses power to appoint Federal Magistrates  Such decision is binding on this Court  The absence of counsel before Hayne J in Re Bryant  Ex parte Guarino and any urgency involved in the hearing of that matter are not relevant issues for this Court in deciding whether to reconsider that decision  Settled precedent would become fragile indeed if circumstances extraneous to the issues decided could cast doubt upon their authority   The name  the Federal Magistrates Service  is merely a name by which the Federal Magistrates Court may be known  The fact that subs   of the FMA provides for an alternative name for that court is irrelevant to its statutory creation  The creation of the court and of its constitutional validity has already been determined in Re Bryant  Ex parte Guarino    It follows that the applicant s submissions concerning the constitutional validity of the appointment of Federal Magistrates and of the Federal Magistrates Court are rejected consideredRe Fernandes     H   N     ER   at     Quite apart from its statutory origins  the Federal Magistrates Court has power to punish for contempt  see s   of the FMA   It was recognised in the United Kingdom that a court of assize or of nisi prius which had certain powers  including powers to punish for contempt  were regarded as superior courts although not principal superior courts  see Re Fernandes   EngR         H   N     ER   at      However  for the above reasons such historical indicia of a court have no application to the Federal Magistrates Court   For the above reasons  the submissions of the applicant that the Registrars of the Federal Magistrates Court cannot exercise administrative functions are rejected   The applicant submits that the text of the Oath of Office administered to a Registrar differs from that taken by a Federal Magistrate  and that such difference demonstrates a limitation on the Registrar s powers to issue orders in the name of the Federal Magistrates Court referred toRe Jarman and Others  Ex parte Cook   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The above principle  as it applied to the Federal Court of Australia was approved by the High Court in Re Jarman and Others  Ex parte Cook   HCA         CLR   per Toohey and Gaudron JJ at      Since the Federal Magistrates Court is court created under Ch III of the Constitution   the same principle applies  It follows that the exercise of power by a Federal Magistrate is a valid exercise of the power of the Federal Magistrates Court referred toThe Commonwealth

power of a court official to make an order of an adjudicative nature  These decisions  however  are not relevant to the exercise of an administrative function by a Registrar of the Federal Magistrates
