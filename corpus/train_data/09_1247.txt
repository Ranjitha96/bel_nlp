Khant v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAbebe v The Commonwealth of Australia     CLR  The Minister submits that a Tribunal is not required to make the case for an applicant before it  it is for the applicant to make their submissions  see Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia     CLR   at   and Re Ruddock  in his capacity as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  and Another  Ex parte APPLICANT S    HCA         ALR   at     This is undoubtedly correct  However  the inquiry in question would not make the appellant s case for him  Rather  it would seek clarification of the grounds already provided to the delegate  in the circumstance where the delegate s record was wholly unsatisfactory  It is true that the appellant did not reply to the invitation of the Tribunal on these matters  However  the Act  specifically s  C  envisages the circumstance that no reply is forthcoming and the Tribunal may still need to seek additional information before it should make its decision  This was such a circumstance referred toChen v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe Tribunal  having considered the relevant authorities to the application then before it  said  at         In the case currently before the Tribunal  the review applicant put forward to the Department untranslated medical records relating to his maternal grandmother  However  no submissions were provided to the Department to explain the significance or relevance of this evidence to the possible cancellation of the review applicant s student visa  In addition  the Tribunal notes that  in its section  A letter dated   August   the review applicant was invited to provide comment and further information relating to the issues arising in relation to his application for review  However  the review applicant failed to do so within the prescribed period  namely    August   or at any time thereafter   Accordingly  the Tribunal has had regard to the evidence presented to the Department  and accepts that the review applicant may well have been concerned about his maternal grandmother s health at the time that he ceased to be enrolled in a registered course  However  based on the limited evidence before it  the Tribunal is not satisfied that having regard to Ministerial Direction No   the tests in Wang and Chen and the dictionary definition of  exception  that these circumstances  even once cultural matters are factored in  constitute exception circumstances beyond the review applicant s control  Nor does the evidence before the Tribunal provide any causal link between the circumstances cited by the review applicant and the non compliance that has occurred in relation to the cessation of his enrolment  The Tribunal concluded by stating that it was satisfied that the relevant conditions existed for a cancellation of the visa under s   of the Act and reg    b  of the Regulations and upheld the primary decision  The appellant then applied to the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia for a review of the Tribunal s decision  The grounds of application raised numerous issues relating to the alleged failure of the Tribunal in the conduct of the proceedings  Fifthly  and finally  the appellant claims that the Tribunal applied the wrong test in determining whether grounds existed for the cancellation of his visa  The appellant submits that rather than form a positive state of satisfaction that there were no exceptional circumstances beyond the appellant s control which explained his non compliance with condition   as reg    b ii  of the Regulations requires  the Tribunal referred to the discussion in Chen v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR   at         That discussion is based on s  L b  of the Act which is phrased in different terms to reg    b ii   That section requires an appellant to satisfy the Tribunal that certain circumstances do exist  In contrast  reg    b ii  requires the Tribunal to form a positive state of satisfaction that exceptional circumstances don t exist  The appellant submits that such application of the wrong test constitutes a jurisdictional error citedLuu and Another v Renevier     ALR  In Minister for

Wednesbury unreasonableness   see   of Le regarding Wednesbury    Despite comments in SZIAI at     and     noting the difference between judicial review under the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act   and judicial review under s  v  of The Constitution   SZIAI would not appear to disturb Le   Indeed at   of SZIAI the majority stated    no factual basis for the conclusion that the failure to inquire constituted a failure to undertake the statutory duty of review or that it was otherwise so unreasonable as to support a finding that the tribunal s decision was infected by jurisdictional error    emphasis added   Such statement would appear to confirm that a failure to make an inquiry could constitute jurisdictional error for at least two different reasons  Those are  a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction in fulfilling the role of the Tribunal to review  and   Wednesbury unreasonableness      about a critical fact    Both SZIAI and Le formulate the type of information similarly    an obvious inquiry about a critical fact    in SZIAI at   or   obtain important information on a critical issue    in Le at    The Court believes that the information in the present circumstances satisfies such test  It was critical to the review whether the appellant s failure to comply with his visa conditions was due to exceptional circumstances beyond his control  The Tribunal was on notice that there evidently were exceptional circumstances claimed through the decision record of the delegate  and the unexplained medical records  However  on the information before the Tribunal  it could not be clear precisely what those grounds were  Both SZIAI and Le make it plain that the inquiry must be directed towards information    the existence of which is easily ascertained    in SZIAI at   or   which the decision maker knows  or ought reasonably to know is readily available    in Le at    In Le   Kenny J found  at         At the least  a decision maker  acting reasonably in the Wednesbury Corporation sense  would have sought to verify whether the primary decision maker s statements regarding Mr Nguyen s supposed admissions derived from what the primary decision maker mistakenly understood to be the effect of Mr Nguyen s written statement  Additionally  a decision maker  acting reasonably in this sense  would have enquired whether the interviewing officer  acting under the misapprehension that Mr Nguyen said that his marriage relationship had ended  had advised Mr Nguyen to withdraw his sponsorship  In the circumstances of this case  especially the mistranslation  a decision maker acting reasonably might also have made some enquiry as to whether the interpreter at the Departmental interview was adequately qualified and  perhaps  whether the interpreter had accompanied the others to Mr Huynh s residence that day   These enquiries were not difficult to make  The Tribunal ought to have known that they might readily be made  Presumably  they would have yielded at least some relevant information on issues that were plainly critical to the outcome of the Tribunal s review  Alternatively  a call or email to the delegate or Department would be highly likely to have provided at least some degree of clarification of the exceptional circumstances claimed by the appellant  Kenny J found in Le at   as extracted above  that an enquiry of the primary decision maker was a step that could be taken by the Tribunal  It is possible that the delegate would not recall the circumstances of   March     April   or the exceptional circumstances claimed by the appellant at that time  as submitted by the Minister  but such possibility is unlikely  Even if information was not forthcoming from either of these sources  had such enquiries been made the Tribunal would have put beyond all doubt that it had before it all the information it could to make its decision  In such circumstance s  C of the Act would have allowed it to proceed to its decision and there would have been no ground for criticism from this Court  As it stands  however  the Court finds that there was a failure by the Tribunal to make an obvious inquiry about a critical fact  the existence of which was easily ascertainable  Is there a jurisdictional error followedMinister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZIAI and Another   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe decision of the High Court in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZIAI and Another   HCA         ALR   was due to be handed down shortly after the hearing of these proceedings  The Court granted leave to the appellant and Minister to make further submissions in reliance upon this decision and for both the appellant and Minister to make further submissions in reply to each other s further submissions  Both the appellant and Minister took advantage of the leave to make submissions on the effect of SZIAI   and the Minister has also made submissions in reply to the appellant s submissions on the effect of SZIAI   As will become apparent  the Court finds such submissions to be highly relevant to its decision  The Court will make its decision in the present matter having reliance only on the first ground of appeal made by the appellant and submissions on the effect of SZIAI   The Court does not need to  and therefore declines to  make any findings in relation to the other grounds of appeal  though it should be noted that submissions in relation to the other grounds of appeal are partially relevant for the consideration of ground one  The factual matrix The present proceedings arise out of very distinct factual circumstances  All of the following observations are made based on the information that was before the Tribunal  Firstly  it appears that there was no interview between the delegate and the appellant on   March   as had been scheduled  No record existed explaining why there was no interview  There was no record of the rescheduling of the interview to   April   when the decision was made  These facts must be considered against the background of detailed records of communications made and received between the Department and the appellant in previous communications such as those regarding the first notice  The absence of any information explaining what occurred on   March   is  to say the least  puzzling  One would have expected there to be some record of events which occurred on that day  even if the proceedings were simply adjourned  In the circumstances  the Court considers that the test at   of SZIAI may be apposite  It   may be that a failure to make an obvious inquiry about a critical fact  the existence of which is easily ascertained  could  in some circumstances  supply a sufficient link to the outcome to constitute a failure to review    The majority in SZIAI found that a failure to make an inquiry in the above circumstances could constitute a jurisdictional error because of a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction  As will be discussed  the majority also left open the door for failure to make an inquiry being a jurisdictional error for other reasons  Therefore a failure of a Tribunal to make inquires in certain circumstances may also constitute jurisdictional error due to   Wednesbury unreasonableness   see   of Le regarding Wednesbury    Despite comments in SZIAI at     and     noting the difference between judicial review under the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act   and judicial review under s  v  of The Constitution   SZIAI would not appear to disturb Le   Indeed at   of SZIAI the majority stated    no factual basis for the conclusion that the failure to inquire constituted a failure to undertake the statutory duty of review or that it was otherwise so unreasonable as to support a finding that the tribunal s decision was infected by jurisdictional error    emphasis added   Such statement would appear to confirm that a failure to make an inquiry could constitute jurisdictional error for at least two different reasons  Those are  a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction in fulfilling the role of the Tribunal to review  and   Wednesbury unreasonableness      about a critical fact    Both SZIAI and Le formulate the type of information similarly    an obvious inquiry about a critical fact    in SZIAI at   or   obtain important information on a critical issue    in Le at    The Court believes that the information in the present circumstances satisfies such test  It was critical to the review whether the appellant s failure to comply with his visa conditions was due to exceptional circumstances beyond his control  The Tribunal was on notice that there evidently were exceptional circumstances claimed through the decision record of the delegate  and the unexplained medical records  However  on the information before the Tribunal  it could not be clear precisely what those grounds were  Further to the above  SZIAI requires that the inquiry be an obvious one in the circumstances  The exact nature of the inquiry could have been to seek to contact the appellant by another means such as email or telephone since the Tribunal had his details  Alternatively  the Tribunal could have contacted the delegate or Department  The Minister submits that it would be strange that in the circumstance that s  C and s   prevented the Tribunal from inviting the appellant before it that it should be able to seek oral evidence under s   and s    However  that informal mechanism is exactly what the High Court has said is available in SZKTI at    Even if the Tribunal did not seek oral evidence  the Tribunal could have sought to clarify whether the appellant had  in fact  received the invitation  To repeat  this is not to suggest that such step is always required of the Tribunal  merely that in certain circumstances it should be taken  Both SZIAI and Le make it plain that the inquiry must be directed towards information    the existence of which is easily ascertained    in SZIAI at   or   which the decision maker knows  or ought reasonably to know is readily available    in Le at    In SZIAI the majority found  at          there was nothing on the record to indicate that any further inquiry by the tribunal  directed to the authenticity of the certificates  could have yielded a useful result  There was nothing before the Federal Magistrates Court or the Federal Court to indicate what information might be elicited if the tribunal were to undertake the inquiry which was said to be critical to the validity of its decision  The inquiry suggested was telephone contact with the persons whose mobile telephone numbers were shown on the certificates  But the question whether the certificates contained false statements as to authorship or otherwise would not be able to be determined by calls placed to those telephone numbers  If the respondents to the calls admitted to the tribunal or its officers that the certificates contained false statements  then the grounds for a decision adverse to SZIAI would have been strengthened  If the respondents said that the contents were true  it would have added nothing to the statements effectively conveyed by the certificates themselves  The second reason is that the response made by SZIAI s solicitors to the tribunal s letter of   January   itself indicated the futility of further inquiry  The Court considers that the latter ground is relevant for the current circumstances  The Court considers that traditionally Wednesbury unreasonableness has been seen as only applicable in the most extreme of circumstances  That may well be why the High Court allowed the appeal in SZIAI   The Court does not consider that the Tribunal s failure to make further inquiries was so unreasonable that no reasonable person would have adopted such course  Rather  the Court prefers the view that the failure to make further inquires of the appellant  or to inquire of the delegate or Department  coupled with the ease at which such inquiry could be made  coupled with the paucity of information the Tribunal had to make its decision  coupled with the type of inquiry required by reg    b  of the Regulations leads to the conclusion that the Tribunal failed to conduct a proper review  Despite the prolixity of the Tribunal decision  in reality  the Tribunal only served as a  rubber stamp  for the primary decision  a decision that was obviously highly problematic  even on the evidence before the Tribunal  The affidavit The Court makes such finding in the absence of reliance on the affidavit of the appellant  The Court does not need to rely on such affidavit  and it would be problematic to do so  given that the appellant has not been cross examined on it  although the Minister declined the opportunity to do so in both the Federal Magistrates Court and before this Court  The Court accepts that when the appellant s affidavit was provided to Raphael FM the Minister was justified in considering that it was not relevant to any issue which was then identified  However  since the Federal Magistrate relied upon the affidavit in reaching his decision  this Court was obliged to take it into consideration followedMinister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKTI and Another   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA a htmlThe first submission of the appellant  as it was made orally  contended that there was a discretion vested in the Tribunal  pursuant to s   and s  C of the Act  to not proceed to make a decision on the facts before it  even though the appellant had failed to respond to the invitation seeking more information  The appellant submits that the Tribunal retains a discretion to gain more information in such situation  and pursuant to Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKTI and Another   HCA         ALR     it may do that by telephone or other means  The appellant submits that in the very particular factual circumstances of these proceedings the Tribunal should have sought more information before making its decision  These circumstances include the uncertainty surrounding   March   the unclear decision of the delegate  the unclear purpose of the medical documents provided to the delegate  and the obligation of the Tribunal  pursuant to reg    b  of the Regulations  to be positively satisfied that there were no exceptional circumstances explaining the appellant s failure to comply with condition   of his visa  The appellant s counsel acknowledges that the issues raised for consideration by the Amended Notice of Appeal were not raised in the hearing before the Federal Magistrate in the precise form currently argued  However  the appellant submits that since the delivery of judgment by the Federal Magistrate  the High Court of Australia has delivered its decisions in SZMOK and in SZKTI which were on   July   and on   August   respectively  each of which the appellant submits are pertinent to the issues raised by the appeal  In regards to the first factor  the Court considers that the legal arguments have a reasonable prospect of success  The explanation for the failure to raise the arguments below  that being recent High Court authority  is sufficient  The Court accepts that the decisions of SZMOK and SZKTI are highly relevant for the purposes of the appellant s arguments  The Court considers that there is no inconvenience to it in allowing the appellant s arguments  given that it was open to the Court to hear arguments in favour of granting leave and  if granted  then to proceed into a consideration of the new grounds of appeal in the hearing of the proceedings  As to the fourth factor referred to in NAJT   obviously much is at stake for the appellant  An unsuccessful appeal will see his visa cancelled and his deportation to Myanmar  Indeed  one could imagine few more significant consequences for an individual in a hearing before the Federal Court  The Tribunal addressed such issue obliquely at   to   of its decision  However  it concentrated on the narrower issue of whether it could have invited the appellant to appear before it  notwithstanding his failure to reply to the invitation  The Tribunal referred to conflicting authority which considered whether s   and s  A of the Act mandates that upon the failure to respond under s  C of the Act  an applicant is not entitled to appear before the Tribunal  The Federal Magistrate also considered such issue  Since SZKTI it is clear that a Tribunal may obtain information without an appellant appearing before it  for example by telephone  see SZKTI at    referring to s   which is in identical terms to s   and s    Therefore  the Tribunal never addressed the issue why it was not exercising its discretion to attempt to seek further information  Instead it appears that the Tribunal either felt it had no power to invite the appellant to appear before it  or  even if it did  it refused to do so  This is not to suggest that the Tribunal must positively state in every decision similar to the current one why it is not going to seek additional information when an applicant fails to provide a response  However  it is notable that the Tribunal did feel it necessary to explain its decision not to seek more information in the present circumstances  albeit on the narrower issue of whether it could have attempted to invite the applicant to appear before it  In many situations  the Tribunal s decision to proceed to a final decision in the absence of comment by the applicant may not be problematic  as the reasons for not seeking further information would be obvious  One of the reasons for the provision of invitations to provide more information or make comment under s  A of the Act is procedural fairness  For example  the requirement that an applicant ought to be able to make comment on information adverse to his or her position  s  A   In the situation where no comment is forthcoming  there will usually be no difficulty with the Tribunal exercising its discretion to proceed to a decision because the applicant has been afforded procedural fairness  in the sense of being invited to comment  even if such offer is not accepted  It is possible that  as demonstrated by the current circumstances  the Tribunal can proceed upon a fiction  that being that the applicant had been provided with notice when  in reality  the notice had not been received  The Act  pursuant to sections such as s  C  makes it clear that such a course is open to the Tribunal  However  the current situation is distinct  Although the Act allowed the Tribunal to proceed to decision in the absence of a reply from the appellant  if it did so it would be proceeding on a paucity of facts on an issue critical to the eventual finding  that being whether there were exceptional circumstances which justified the appellant s failure to comply with condition   of his visa  As the Tribunal itself said in the invitation      If the Tribunal ultimately finds that you did not comply with condition   of your student visa   the Tribunal will need to consider whether the non compliance was  due to exceptional circumstances beyond the non citizen s control   Further to the above  SZIAI requires that the inquiry be an obvious one in the circumstances  The exact nature of the inquiry could have been to seek to contact the appellant by another means such as email or telephone since the Tribunal had his details  Alternatively  the Tribunal could have contacted the delegate or Department  The Minister submits that it would be strange that in the circumstance that s  C and s   prevented the Tribunal from inviting the appellant before it that it should be able to seek oral evidence under s   and s    However  that informal mechanism is exactly what the High Court has said is available in SZKTI at    Even if the Tribunal did not seek oral evidence  the Tribunal could have sought to clarify whether the appellant had  in fact  received the invitation  To repeat  this is not to suggest that such step is always required of the Tribunal  merely that in certain circumstances it should be taken  The Court considers that a further inquiry of the appellant would have clarified the key issue  that being whether or not there were exceptional circumstances explaining his non compliance with condition   of his visa  The mere failure of the appellant to reply to the invitation was not evidence that there were no exceptional circumstances  As subsequent facts showed  such failure was because he never received the invitation  The Tribunal was not to know that  but it could have emailed or phoned the appellant to find out with certainty whether there was evidence of exceptional circumstances  Such step would not have posed any difficulty  since the Tribunal held the appellant s email and telephone contact details  Positive contact with the appellant himself could have put beyond any doubt whether there were  in fact  exceptional circumstances  It is absurd to claim in the light of SZKTI that a simple telephone call or email to the appellant to make contact with him did not render such information   easily ascertainable   referred toMinister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZMOK and Others   FCAFC

discussing when leave should be granted for new grounds to be argued on appeal is to be found in the decision of Flick J in SZKCQ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   at         The Court has had regard to those authorities  particularly the decision of Madgwick J in NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at   in which his Honour stated eight factors guiding the exercise of discretion to grant leave for an appellant to rely on new grounds of appeal  Those grounds were  Do the new legal arguments have a reasonable prospect of success  Is there an acceptable explanation of why they were not raised below  How much dislocation to the Court and efficient use of judicial sitting time is really involved  What is at stake in the case for the appellant  Will the resolution of the issues raised have any importance beyond the case at hand  Is there any actual prejudice  not viewing the notion of prejudice narrowly  to the respondent  If so  can it justly and practicably be cured  If not  where  in all the circumstances  do the interests of justice lie   Overall  the leave will be granted where it is   expedient in the interests of justice to allow the new ground to be argued and determined   see VAAC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at      Consideration The Court has considered the matters raised before the Federal Magistrate and is satisfied that the issues now sought to be raised on appeal are different to the issues raised before the Federal Magistrate  The Court  having considered the eight factors referred to in NAJT   will grant leave for the appellant to rely on the new grounds of appeal for the following reasons  In regards to the first factor  the Court considers that the legal arguments have a reasonable prospect of success  The explanation for the failure to raise the arguments below  that being recent High Court authority  is sufficient  The Court accepts that the decisions of SZMOK and SZKTI are highly relevant for the purposes of the appellant s arguments  The Court considers that there is no inconvenience to it in allowing the appellant s arguments  given that it was open to the Court to hear arguments in favour of granting leave and  if granted  then to proceed into a consideration of the new grounds

deportation to Myanmar  Indeed  one could imagine few more significant consequences for an individual in a hearing before the Federal Court  Finally  as to the issue of prejudice to the respondent  the Minister relied upon Water Board v Moustakas   HCA         CLR   at   where the majority said   more than once it has been held by this Court that a point cannot be raised for the first time on appeal when it could possibly have been met by calling evidence below    However  Moustakas relates to a situation distinct from the present circumstances  The appeal court described in Moustakas was an appeal court from a first instance trial   In that circumstance  it is far more understandable that a court of appeal would seek to constrain grounds of appeal that could call for more evidence  While this Court is acting as a court of appeal  it is so acting in respect of a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court which itself was acting as a court of judicial review of a Tribunal decision  not a trial court  In that sense  this Court is just as well placed as the Federal Magistrates Court to receive evidence or review the decision of the Tribunal  In the circumstance that this Court is effectively judicially reviewing a decision of the Tribunal  being the practical effect where new grounds are relied upon and no error is shown on the part of the Federal Magistrate  then this Court is in just as good a position as the Federal Magistrates Court to fulfil that role  Consequently  the Court does not believe that Moustakas is apposite in the present circumstances and prefers to rely on the considerations of minimising prejudice discussed in the decision of NAJT  referred toPlaintiff S  v The Commonwealth of Australia     CLR  It is not enough that the Tribunal makes an error  that error must be a jurisdictional error if the decision is to be quashed  see Plaintiff S  v The Commonwealth of Australia     CLR   at    As outlined above  two alternative grounds of jurisdictional error would appear to be Wednesbury unreasonableness or a constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction in failing to fulfil the role of the Tribunal  that is  to review citedRe Ruddock

appellant claims that the Tribunal applied the wrong test in determining whether grounds existed for the cancellation of his visa  The appellant submits that rather than form a positive state of satisfaction that there were no exceptional circumstances beyond the appellant s control which explained his non compliance with condition   as reg    b ii  of the Regulations requires  the Tribunal referred to the discussion in Chen v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR   at         That discussion is based on s  L b  of the Act which is phrased in different terms to reg    b ii   That section requires an appellant to satisfy the Tribunal that certain circumstances do exist  In contrast  reg    b ii  requires the Tribunal to form a positive state of satisfaction that exceptional circumstances don t exist  The appellant submits that such application of the wrong test constitutes a jurisdictional error  The Minister submits that a Tribunal is not required to make the case for an applicant before it  it is for the applicant to make their submissions  see Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia     CLR   at   and Re Ruddock  in his capacity as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  and Another  Ex parte APPLICANT S    HCA         ALR   at     This is undoubtedly correct  However  the inquiry in question would not make the appellant s case for him  Rather  it would seek clarification of the grounds already provided to the delegate  in the circumstance where the delegate s record was wholly unsatisfactory  It is true that the appellant did not reply to the invitation of the Tribunal on these matters  However  the Act  specifically s  C  envisages the circumstance that no reply is forthcoming and the Tribunal may still need to seek additional information before it should make its decision  This was such a circumstance referred toSnedden v Republic of Croatia  No     FCAFC  In the circumstances where the appeal has been upheld on grounds that were not before the Federal Magistrate  or at least not before the Federal Magistrate in the form now put  the usual rule that costs follow the event should not apply  This is because there was no fault on the part of the Federal Magistrate in making the decision he did  Rather  the Court considers that each party should pay their own costs of the appeal  similarly

pursuant to SZJBA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and Another   FCA         FCR     was obliged to undertake reasonably open and regular administrative steps to permit or facilitate fulfilment of the   real and meaningful nature of the invitation to comment    at    The appellant submits that such obligation arises where the Tribunal is aware that the record of claims made by an applicant and received by the Tribunal is incomplete  It is submitted by the appellant that the Tribunal was aware of a   conspicuous absence of any explanation   of the medical records submitted by the appellant  Thirdly  the appellant submits that  following the submissions in ground one  namely that the Tribunal retains a discretion pursuant to s   and s  C of the Act to obtain further information even if a reply to an invitation is not forthcoming  that exercise of discretion is guided by s   and s  A  of the Act  Section   states    The Tribunal shall  in carrying out its functions under this Act  pursue the objective of providing a mechanism of review that is fair  just  economical and quick    The Tribunal  in reviewing a decision   a  is not bound by technicalities

and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at      Consideration The Court notes the prejudice identified by the Minister relating to grounds one  three and four relied upon by the appellant and the assertion that the Minister might have chosen to lead evidence in the Federal Magistrates Court had it been on notice of the grounds as now raised  The Court also notes that the Minister  in supplementary submissions  noted that ground one had been partially raised before the Court below in similar terms to those now put  The Court notes that the Minister was afforded the opportunity to cross examine the appellant and was also granted the opportunity to adjourn the proceedings in order that it be able to put on further evidence  Such offer was declined  An offer to allow the Minister to cross examine the appellant on his affidavit in the Court below was also declined by the Minister  In the circumstances  the Court believes the Minister has been given adequate opportunity to rectify any prejudice identified  particularly as this Court is in just as good a position to take evidence to review a decision of the Tribunal as the Federal Magistrates Court  Even if such prejudice is not overcome  the Court considers that it is   expedient in the interests of justice to allow the new ground to be argued and determined   VAAC at   citedVideto and Another v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     FCR  In Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Le and Others   FCA         FCR   Kenny J at   observed      The concept of vitiating unreasonableness has been extended to the manner in which a decision was made  Thus  a failure by a decision maker to obtain important information on a critical issue  which the decision maker knows or ought reasonably to know is readily available  may be characterised as so unreasonable that no reasonable decision maker would proceeded  sic  to make the decision without making the enquiry  see Prasad   FCR at     per Wilcox J  Videto v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs   FCA         FCR   at   per Toohey J   Videto   Luu v Renevier     ALR   at     per Davies  Wilcox and Pincus JJ   Luu v Renevier

FCR   at   per Ryan and Finkelstein JJ   Yang    This proposition is also discussed in other cases  such as Yao Jing v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs     FCR   at   per Foster J and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Teoh   HCA         CLR   at     per Mason CJ and Deane J and   per McHugh J  In Videto and Another v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs   FCA         FCR     Toohey J at   said      In such a case  potential deportation  it may be that the material placed before the Minister or his delegate contained some obvious omission or obscurity that needs to be resolved before a decision is made explainedWater Board v Moustakas     CLR  Finally  as to the issue of prejudice to the respondent  the Minister relied upon Water Board v Moustakas   HCA         CLR   at   where the majority said   more than once it has been held by this Court that a point cannot be raised for the first time on appeal when it could possibly have been met by calling evidence below    However  Moustakas relates to a situation distinct from the present circumstances  The appeal court described in Moustakas was an appeal court from a first instance trial   In that circumstance  it is far more understandable that a court of appeal would seek to constrain grounds of appeal that could call for more evidence  While this Court is acting as a court of appeal  it is so acting in respect of a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court which itself was acting as a court of judicial review of a Tribunal decision  not a trial court  In that sense  this Court is just as well placed as the Federal Magistrates Court to receive evidence or review the decision of the Tribunal  In the circumstance that this Court is effectively judicially reviewing a decision of the Tribunal  being the practical effect where new grounds are relied upon and no error is shown on the part of the Federal Magistrate  then this Court is in just as good a position as the Federal Magistrates Court to fulfil that role  Consequently  the Court does not believe that Moustakas is apposite in the present circumstances and prefers to rely on the considerations of minimising prejudice discussed in the decision of NAJT
