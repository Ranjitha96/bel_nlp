followedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   the High Court considered the incorporation into s  AA of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  the concept of unconscionability in the unwritten law  While s  AC is a separate and freestanding statutory provision  the word  unconscionable  is undefined in both s  AA and s  AC  The latter section identifies a range of factors to which the Court may have regard in considering whether in all the circumstances the relevant conduct is unconscionable  The factors identified in s  AC  are  of course  not exhaustive  but they have similarities to the features of unconscionability or unconscientious behaviour identified in decisions of Blomley v Ryan   HCA         CLR   and Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd v Amadio   HCA         CLR    In ACCC v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at     Gleeson CJ observed that a person was not in a position of relevant disadvantage simply because of inequality of bargaining powers  He said that many  perhaps even most  contracts are made between parties of unequal bargaining power  and good conscience does not require parties to contractual negotiations to forfeit their advantages  or neglect their own interests  And the Chief Justice continued that unconscientious exploitation or another s inability  or diminished ability  to conserve his or her own interests is not to be confused with taking advantage of a superior bargaining position for the purposes of s  AA   CLR at       However  a difference in bargaining positions is a factor which is one of the relevant circumstances that can be taken into account under s  AC a   In ACCC v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at           Gleeson CJ pointed out that the critical disadvantage from which the lessees in that case suffered was that they had no legal entitlement to a renewal or extension of the lease  that depended upon the lessors  willingness to grant such rights  In that context there was a compulsion to deal with the lessors which created a distinct disadvantage on the lessees  but not such as to attract the unwritten law of unconscionability to their position  As Gleeson CJ said     It is an everyday occurrence in negotiations for settlement of legal disputes that  as a term of settlement  one party will be required to abandon claims which may or may not be related to the principal matter in issue      He said that parties to commercial negotiations frequently use their bargaining power to  extract  concessions from other parties but that was the stuff of ordinary commercial dealings  see too per Gummow and Hayne JJ at   CLR at         and Callinan J at           Monster gave no explanation for its failure to accept the offer of new IVR licences in the period following   October    Nor did it identify any conduct of APRA and AMCOS as being unconscionable while Monster did not reply to the   October   letter  Monster saw its own interests were served by it not pursuing that matter  That only changed on   January   when APRA and AMCOS made a threat to commence proceedings if Monster did not pay what they said was due by   February  the day after the letter of   February   was sent   I do not see any element of unconscientiousness or moral obloquy on the part of APRA and AMCOS in this situation  Monster was advised by solicitors  Mr Chong was well able to make commercial decisions in what he saw as being Monster s and his own best interests  For Monster s and his own reasons  about which he gave no evidence  he chose not to take up the offer of new IVR licences at a time when it was obvious APRA and AMCOS were prepared to grant them in late October    And  because Monster had no licences  and was not continuing to trade without them  APRA and AMCOS were entitled to act as they did in seeking to enforce their rights to prevent infringement of copyrights in which they were interested appliedBallas v Theophilos  No     HCA         CLR

bound to follow what it argued was the different approach in Fitzgerald v Masters   HCA         CLR    In that case  of course  there was an obvious mistake  The question was how should the Court construe the language used  McTiernan  Webb and Taylor JJ said   CLR at      It is trite law that an instrument must be construed as a whole  Indeed it is the only method by which inconsistencies of expression may be reconciled and it is in this natural and commonsense approach to problems of construction that justification is to be found for the rejection of repugnant words  the transposition of

contract     The fact that a particular construction leads to a very unreasonable result must be a relevant consideration  The more unreasonable the result the more unlikely it is that the parties can

non payment of royalties to APRA and AMCOS was quite flagrant  Mr Chong thought he could get away without paying for what was due just as he did with trying to get away with using other people s rights without having first made any  let alone  proper arrangements for their use  I think there should be an appropriate marking of the Court s disapproval by a significant award  see Raben Footwear Pty Ltd v Polygram Records Inc     FCR   at     cp  Australian Performing Right Association Ltd v Pashalidis     IPR   at     per Moore J    Monster s and Mr Chong s conduct merits a substantial amount of additional damages being awarded so as to mark disapproval of its infringing conduct and to deter others from engaging in similar behaviour  During the   year period to   June   Monster s total revenues from all its telecommunications service providers accounts total over   million  These include considerable revenues generated by the infringements  But the use of ringtone downloads was a means of attracting Monster s customers to all its advertised products  In my opinion  on the basis of my findings  I should fix the amount of additional damages at   citedRe Powercom

Interactive Media Pty Ltd     FLR   at     per Lindgren P  The President found that in storing ringtones on its computers  a ringtone supplier makes a reproduction of those parts of the musical works embodied in the ringtones for the purposes of s  a i  of the Copyright Act    Cth   In electronically transmitting ringtones to a mobile telephone  the ringtone supplier exercises the right of communication to the public in respect of those parts of the musical works embodied in the ringtones  s  a iv  of the Act  s   contains a definition of the word  communicate  as meaning to  make available online or electronically transmit     a work or other subject matter   By providing an IVR service  a ringtone supplier authorizes the making of the copy of the ringtones which are created in the customer s mobile telephones upon electronic transmission of them  for the purposes of s   of the Act    FLR at         Relevantly  each of the SMS licences dated   January   is in identical terms  except for the fees payable under Schedule   the identity of the licensors and an extra clause in the AMCOS version regulating reproduction of musical works  cl    Each SMS licence commenced on   October    cl    APRA was entitled to a fee for monophonic or polyphonic format ringtones of      inclusive of GST  of the retail price subject to a minimum fee of    cents  inclusive of GST  per sale  The fee for phonographic format  i e  MP  ringtones was      inclusive of GST  of the retail price subject to a minimum fee of     per sale  At all times  Monster charged consumers  according to its advertisements     per ringtone downloaded via an SMS service   AMCOS was entitled to a fixation fee of   in respect of each new AMCOS work added to the licensee s inventory in the quarter for which the fees were payable  In addition  the licensee had to pay AMCOS a fee for each ringtone of   inclusive of GST of the retail price subject to a minimum fee of    cents  inclusive of GST  per sale   I am of opinion that no such order should be made  Monster has committed serious breaches of the IVR and SMS licences in the past  I do not think that it is appropriate to force APRA and AMCOS into a contractual relationship in the circumstances  I am not satisfied that they would not negotiate the granting of new licences to Monster in good faith  If Monster cannot obtain in such negotiations new licences from APRA  the Copyright Tribunal has power to settle their terms  That power may also extend to the AMCOS licences in circumstances such as the present  Re Powercom Interactive Media Pty Ltd     FLR at         per Lindgren P   Monster was unlicensed from   August   in respect of IVR services and from   December in respect of SMS services  It is liable to APRA and AMCOS for damages for infringement  APRA and AMCOS exercised their election to claim damages rather than an account of profits  It is agreed that the appropriate sum by which compensatory damages should be fixed is what would have been payable under the licences had Monster been licensed  That is a reasonable approach and I will adopt it   Mr Mallett identified four licensees of ringtones from APRA and AMCOS which he said were comparable to the business operated by Monster  The trading names of the licensees were Jamster  Bugal  Blue Sky Frog and Powercom  He concluded that the proportions of ringtone downloads of all downloads in each of those competitors  businesses over the periods he examined were between     and      This was based on the amount of licence fees paid to APRA and AMCOS by each of those licensees during the relevant licence periods  Mr Mallett estimated  based on his comparison with the four competitors  about     of Monster s revenue over its period of trading was attributable to ringtone services  This led to a claim that total licence fees due to   June   were   million of which only about   had been paid appliedReid v Moreland Timber Co Pty Limited   HCA

damages should not impose a punishment greater than would be imposed if the conduct were criminal   XL Petroleum  NSW  Pty Ltd v Caltex Oil  Australia  Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   per Gibbs J   The defendant s financial circumstances are a relevant consideration   XL   CLR at   per Gibbs CJ    per Brennan J  as has been the period of the conduct and its circumstances citedZhu v Treasurer of NSW   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  A commercial purpose of the SMS licences was to enable APRA and AMCOS to receive a percentage of the earnings of those seeking to exploit copyright works over which they had rights  The SMS licences authorized Monster to use telecommunications networks to communicate and reproduce the copyright ringtone  In ordinary English usage   retail price  is the amount paid by the customer for the goods or service  It is not the net amount the retailer receives after paying a sum not disclosed to the customer for the right to sell the goods or service  The term  retail price  should be construed so as to avoid it making commercial nonsense or working commercial inconvenience  as Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Callinan and Heydon JJ said in Zhu v Treasurer of NSW   HCA         CLR   at       They also said that the commercial purpose of reasonable persons in the position of the parties was relevant  as were the genesis of the transaction  the background  the context and the market in which the parties were operating  as known to each of them   CLR at       A significant commercial purpose of the SMS licences was to enable the whole download procedure to be authorised by the licensors and for the money generated by the exploitation of the rights they granted to be used as the basis for calculating the royalty fee due respectively to each of APRA and AMCOS   Moreover  it would be a very odd construction of the ordinary English language term  retail price  to divorce the price advertised by Monster to the public as the price payable for the download  from the price on which Monster was liable to account for royalties  Monster organised through its various telecommunication contracts and licences with APRA and AMCOS  a situation in which members of the public could use their own telephones to obtain a service Monster had for sale  Monster contracted with the public by offering to sell the SMS download to them for the price of     in its advertisements  That involved Monster becoming an agent  or using agents  to ensure that the transaction was carried out so the consumer received that for which he or she paid  Monster needed to charge its customer a price to cover its costs of delivering the download   It is necessary to construe an agreement so as to avoid making it commercial nonsense or working commercial inconvenience  The commercial purpose of the definitions  that is to say the purpose of a reasonable person in the position of the parties to the contract  is relevant  That in turn requires attention to the genesis of the transaction  the background  the context  the market in which the parties were operating  as known to both parties  Zhu v Treasurer of New South Wales   HCA         CLR   at        Accordingly  the     per second and non telecommunications service charges should not be deducted from net call revenue   APRA and AMCOS say they were entitled to terminate the IVR licences because the interim fees invoiced after the audit were not paid within   days  By cll     and     of the APRA IVR licence  cll     and     of the AMCOS one  Monster had to pay any invoice issued by the licensor within   days after the date of the invoice  An invoice for additional licence fees issued after APRA received information under cl    cl   of the AMCOS IVR licence  had also to be paid within this time  cll     and     respectively
