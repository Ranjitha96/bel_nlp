Technologies Inc    FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The applicant  Retractable Technologies Inc  RTI  seeks leave to appeal pursuant to s  A  of the Federal Court of Australia Act   and O   r   of the Federal Court Rules from an interlocutory judgment of Dowsett J   Occupational and Medical Innovations Limited v Retractable Technologies Inc    FCA     OMI v RTI   dismissing RTI s application for preliminary discovery of documents by the respondent  Occupational and Medical Innovations Limited  OMI  pursuant to O  A  r   of the Federal Court Rules    In the primary application  RTI sought preliminary discovery of a range of documents relating to communications between OMI and its contracting party China Medical Group Inc  CMG  and or communications between OMI and an entity described as Double Dove Group Co Ltd  DDGCL  and other entities said to be related to DDGCL concerning the manufacture  sterilization  packaging and supply by CMG to OMI of a product described as a  retractable syringe   The material before the primary Judge comprised five volumes of evidence including one volume  Volume   containing confidential information and was therefore comprehensive  For the purposes of these reasons  I have made reference to a number of documents from the confidential volume referred to in submissions before the court on the present application  References to those documents do not include any reference to the commercially sensitive aspects of the documents   Order  A  r   contemplates that where there is reasonable cause to believe that an applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the court from an ascertained person  the applicant  after making all reasonable enquiries  does not have sufficient information to enable a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding in the court  and there is reasonable cause to believe that a person  has or is likely to have or has had or is likely to have had  possession of any document relating to the question of whether the applicant has the right to obtain the postulated relief  and inspection of the documents by the applicant would assist in making a decision whether to commence a proceeding  the court may order that the identified person make discovery of the relevant documents to the applicant citedD cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc     FCR   In considering the evidence and dismissing RTI s application  the primary Judge exercised a discretion to be exercised according to settled principle  In seeking leave to appeal from the exercise of that discretion  the considerations are whether in all the circumstances the decision of the primary Judge is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant its being reconsidered by the Full Court and whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused supposing the decision to be wrong   D cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc     FCR   at   per Sheppard  Burchett and Heerey JJ  Jarrett v Seymour     FCR   at   and   per Lockhart  Sheppard and Beaumont JJ    Although plainly enough an application for leave to appeal does not involve a reconsideration of the primary application other than to determine whether the D cor Corporation v Dart Industries test is satisfied  it is necessary to consider the contextual facts of the primary application in dealing with the contended errors on the part of the primary Judge   OMI is the patentee of an Australian patent having a priority date of   February   for a device described in the patent  in terms of the object of the invention  as  a single use syringe having a spring biased needle which can shoot back into a hollow plunger stem after use   The patent describes the problems reflected in the prior art for needle devices  the features of OMI s invention  exhibits particular drawings and defines the integers of each monopoly claim by reference to claims   to    On   October   OMI  or at least a company described as OMI Manufacturing Pty Ltd which for present purposes has been treated by the parties as OMI  entered into a manufacturing and distribution agreement with CMG   The manufacturing and distribution agreement contains these terms       a  CMG agrees to manufacture the Product in China  the  Territory   OMI grants CMG exclusive rights to manufacture the Product worldwide   If CMG cannot supply the Product OMI reserves the right to source an alternative manufacturer   cl      The Product is defined by the schedule to mean each OMI retractable syringe manufactured by CMG in accordance with nominated specifications  The schedule does not identify any specifications     b  CMG warrants that the Product shall strictly conform with the specifications listed in the schedule  cl     c   c  CMG agrees to make the necessary modifications to its plant s to enable it to manufacture the Product in accordance with the production requirements set out in schedule     cl       d  CMG agrees to manufacture the Product only at the locations agreed between the parties from time to time   cl       e  CMG agrees that OMI shall have the right  on reasonable written notice  to make inspections including of Product manufactured by CMG and plant locations where CMG manufactures the Product   cl       f  Schedule   deals with  pricing  annual purchase volumes and production requirements  and sets out the pricing for the Product  The pricing provision contemplates that CMG will supply OMI with a retractable syringe of various dimensions including a   ml    ml    ml and   ml Product   cl      Schedule      g  Schedule   contemplates that upon supply and purchase of a substantial number of units of the   ml    ml and   ml Product  prices payable by OMI will be adjusted  Schedule   provides that a production year means each   month period commencing on the date of delivery of the first order of   ml    ml    ml and   ml Products or anniversary thereof  Schedule   also provides that CMG will invoice OMI for Product manufactured in accordance with a purchase order  on delivery of the Product and invoices will be paid within   days     h  Schedule   provides that CMG will provide OMI with a certain number of units of the   ml version no later than   January   and units of the   ml    ml and   ml version no later than eight calendar months after the date of agreement     i  CMG may use such trade marks and names in the Territory as are approved from time to time by OMI on all product  The agreed brand name will be Double Dove and will include the OMI Chinese patent number on all packaging  All such uses shall be consistent with all specifications notified by OMI from time to time   cl      cl       j  Clause     provides  CMG agrees to manufacture Product in accordance with written purchase orders received from OMI  Each purchase order must set out the number and type of Product required  the date delivery  the delivery point and any other matters as agreed between the parties from time to time  If CMG is unable to meet a purchase order  it must notify OMI as soon as it becomes aware that it will not be able to meet the purchase order      k  CMG may not subcontract any part of the manufacturing process in relation to the Product   cl       l  CMG will have the exclusive right to distribute the Product in the Territory   cl       m  The term of the agreement is five years from   October   plus one three year option unless terminated by written notice upon material breach by either party  The option might be exercised by either party at least six months before the end of the initial five year term by notice expressing a  desire to exercise the three year option  and in that event   the parties agree to enter into good faith negotiations in respect of extending this agreement for one further term of three years    cl       n  Clause     contemplates that OMI might give its written consent for CMG to incur costs in relation to particular manufacturing equipment and in such a circumstance OMI accepts a cost liability for an unamortized portion of the cost upon certain events     o  CMG agrees to procure Vital Care to keep in place product liability to a certain value in terms and conditions wholly satisfactory to OMI   cl       p  CMG agrees that it will provide OMI or its agent with any information as may be reasonably requested by OMI in relation to the manufacture of the Product   cl       q  CMG and OMI agree to treat any information communicated to it or any other person in relation to the Product as confidential subject to identified permitted disclosure   cl      The confidentiality clause is to survive the termination of the agreement citedJarrett v Seymour     FCR   In considering the evidence and dismissing RTI s application  the primary Judge exercised a discretion to be exercised according to settled principle  In seeking leave to appeal from the exercise of that discretion  the considerations are whether in all the circumstances the decision of the primary Judge is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant its being reconsidered by the Full Court and whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused supposing the decision to be wrong   D cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc     FCR   at   per Sheppard  Burchett and Heerey JJ  Jarrett v Seymour     FCR   at   and   per Lockhart  Sheppard and Beaumont JJ  citedHouse v The King     CLR   In addressing those considerations it is important to remember that the question of whether in all the circumstances the decision of the primary Judge is attended by sufficient doubt is to be considered in the context of the observation of their Honours Dixon  Evatt and McTiernan JJ in the well known passage from House v The King     CLR   at pp   and    See also Johnston v Cameron   Ors   FCAFC         FCR    FC  Branson  Tamberlin and Finkelstein JJ  per Branson J p     and Australian Broadcasting Commission v Parish  FC  Bowen CJ  Frankie and Deane JJ      ALR   at p   per Bowen CJ   As a result  the conclusion of the primary Judge that RTI s case  cannot possibly succeed    on the footing discussed at   to   of these reasons is attended by sufficient doubt as to warrant reconsideration by the Full Court subject to the question of whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused  However  such a conclusion assumes at its centre that the supply of syringes by CMG involves the use by CMG of RTI s confidential information   In those cases where there is no closely substitutable field of common activity  such as the manufacture of immediately substitutable retractable syringes  use of another s confidential information may be more readily identifiable whether in the form of etchings submitted to a publisher  confidential information contained within a manuscript  an instruction manual provided to a third party or a description of a methodology for a manufacturing process or business method  In the absence of very precise identification particularly in the case however of parties involved in closely substitutable fields of common endeavour  of the information  its confidential character and its use  assertions or general conclusionary contentions relied upon to support a claim of use are insufficient and will not give rise to inferences of use   An illustration of the distinction might be that although Charles Darwin received on   June   Alfred Wallace s letter setting out a theory of natural selection in the evolution of species  Darwin s address to the Linnean Society in London on   July   outlining his central thesis of the origin of species by means of natural selection was the emanation of years of his own research  field studies and thinking   The claims of use of information said to be confidential to RTI made by paragraphs  a   b   c   d   e   f  and  g  and paragraph  b   d  and paragraphs  a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h   i  and  j  against the background of  SW  are no more than an assertion  As to the plunger seal  RTI s evidence is that OMI uses the  specific type  of rubber used by RTI  However  in the light of OMI s response that it uses santoprene and specified santoprene   as early as January   RTI says that santoprene is a form of rubber  That controversy of fact seems to be inconsistent with the initial contention of use of the  specific type  of rubber citedJohnston v Cameron   Ors   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In addressing those considerations

 No     supra  per Deane J at   Corrs Pavey Whiting   Byrne v Collector of Customs  Vic    Anor     FCR   per Gummow J at   O Brien v Komesaroff   HCA         CLR   per Mason J at pp     Liberty

Securities Commission   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In the case  however  of an innocent third party acting bona fide and thus without notice  the circumstances which condition an obligation of conscience are much removed from the commercial intimacy of a bilateral relationship between the originator and primary disclosor and the originator s immediate recipient  importing that obligation  It seems to follow logically in the case of an innocent third party that the court will closely examine the contended circumstances that are said to warrant intervention beyond simply whether the third party has been put on notice and thus identify the  matters which determine whether a duty of confidence has devolved  upon a third party   Johns v Australian Securities Commission   HCA         CLR   at   per Gaudron J   The reasons of the primary Judge suggest that his Honour had in mind the notion that since an assessment of the circumstances in which OMI continues to acquire articles of manufacture said to embody RTI s confidential information includes acceptance of the position that OMI acted as an innocent third party for value pursuant to an arms length contract  the  relevant circumstances  of the present applicant  properly examined  do not give rise to an obligation of conscience in OMI  rather than a notion of simply applying a derivative proprietary rule that a bona fide third party for value can not be the subject of the court s intervention   In Johns v Australian Securities Commission at   Gaudron J recognised that in Foster v Mountford   Rigby Ltd     FLR   at p   Muirhead J enjoined a publisher on an interlocutory basis from continuing to publish and distribute a book revealing  in breach of an obligation of confidence on the part of the author  sites and objects of deep religious and cultural significance to particular Aboriginal claimant groups  and in Wheatley v Bell     NSWLR   at p   Helsham CJ  in Equity  enjoined on an interlocutory basis innocent licensees  described as parties who  have already been licensed or chosen  or engaged  or are either purchasers or potential purchasers  of a promotional business system from using that system notwithstanding that they had apparently paid contracted amounts to a disclosee who had failed to observe an obligation of confidence to the plaintiff disclosor  Gaudron J noted at p   that the law had not developed to a point of identifying in a  definitive or comprehensive way  the matters which would determine whether a duty of confidence might arise in a third party   The decision in Johns v Australian Securities Commission   on this aspect of the matter at least  turned on the basis that the information made available voluntarily to the relevant media organisations had become publicly available and the question of the innocence of the third parties  Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the Herald   Weekly Times Ltd  would require further determinations of questions of fact  The decision in Foster v Mountford arose out of an ex parte application and the commercial arrangements with the publisher were not examined  The decision in Fraser v Evans concerned the disclosure to an English national newspaper of aspects of a confidential report submitted by the plaintiff as a public relations consultant to the Greek Government  The case seemed not to involve acquisition of confidential information pursuant to an arms length contract  Although the consultant had no standing to agitate a contended obligation on the part of the newspaper  and the information  in any event  was of such a nature that disclosure was in the public interest  the statement of general principle recognises that a third party who has not received confidential information in confidence might be restrained  once he gets to know that it was originally given in confidence   The decision in Wheatley v Bell adopted that expression of principle together with the observation of Professor Pettit   Equity and the Law of Trusts     rd ed   that a third party who knowingly obtains confidential information in breach of confidence or in any other fraudulent manner will be restrained from use and  even if a man obtains the confidential information innocently  once he gets to know that it was originally given in confidence  he can be restrained from breaking that confidence  as the foundation for the interlocutory orders against the innocent licensees   There is no doubt that the authorities recognise that an innocent third party thus acting bona fide may come into possession of confidential information of a primary disclosor either by reason of a disclosure in breach of an obligation of confidence by the disclosee owed to the primary disclosor or because an entity dealing with the third party may have a degree of interconnection with the initial recipient such that information has been disclosed to that entity in breach of an obligation of confidence and then disclosed to the third party  and  in principle   in some circumstances the restraint of an apprehended or continued breach of confidence may involve enjoining third parties    Breen v Williams   HCA         CLR   per Gummow J at p   see also  Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd     IPR   per Gummow and Hayne
