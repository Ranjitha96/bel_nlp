SZFGO v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredDaniel v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The present application is over two years outside the time provided for under O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   The Minister submitted that in light of the lateness of the application  an extension of time should be refused as the applicants elected to pursue Ministerial intervention under s   and chose to abandon their rights of appeal  The Minister relied on an observation of Goldberg J in Daniel v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA         ALR   at      Over nine months elapsed between the order dismissing the application for review in the Federal Court and the filing of the application in the High Court  The High Court application was made prior to the handing down of the decision in Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf   HCA         CLR    During that intervening period  on   July   the letter had been written to the Minister requesting him to exercise his power under s   of the Act  The taking of that course of action by the applicant is indicative of a decision by him to abandon any course that would seek to challenge the decision of the Tribunal on grounds available under the Act or otherwise at law      This course of conduct  in my view  should properly be characterised as an indication by the applicant that he was prepared to accept that the Tribunal s decision was correct and that he did not intend to challenge that decision further in the Court  A similar approach has been taken in a number of cases in this Court  Applicant A  of   v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA     Re Batuwantudawa   FCA     Opanayaka Mudiyanselage v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA

very much doubt that what his Honour said in this extract from his reasons was being put as a general statement of principle  more likely  a conclusion drawn from the facts of the case before his Honour  But if I am wrong  then  with respect  I cannot agree with it  The Minister submitted that a Full Federal Court approved Goldberg J s approach in M  of   v Refugee Review Tribunal   Anor   FCAFC         ALR   at     and cited other cases where this Court has held that a request under s   of the Act indicates acceptance of the Tribunal s decision and does not provide an adequate explanation for delay  at   of his submissions   Although the Full Court did not expressly endorse the observation cited above in Daniel   it concluded at    Although the primary judge did not dismiss the application for prohibition on the ground of the appellant s lengthy delay in seeking constitutional writs  that  and the making of a s   application  reinforce the propriety of the proceeding

Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The second additional ground of appeal asserts that the Tribunal failed to apply the correct test in determining whether the applicants had a well founded fear of persecution  The applicants submitted that the Tribunal assessed their evidence on the basis of a  balance of probabilities  test and failed to ask itself  what if I am wrong  as per Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs v Rajalingam   FCA         FCR    The Minister contended that nothing in the Tribunal s decision suggests that it misunderstood its task of determining whether the applicants had a well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason  The applicants did not identify any aspect of the Tribunal s decision that supports this claim in their outline of submissions  In these circumstances  I agree with the Minister s submission and this ground must also fail   In considering whether to exercise my discretion to grant the extension of time that is being sought  in addition to my earlier consideration of the s   application at   I find it impossible to find any error  let alone jurisdictional error  in the learned Federal Magistrate s decision or that the applicants have any prospects of success on appeal   It is for these reasons that I have come to the conclusion that I should not exercise my discretion to grant an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal  even if such an extension were granted  the applicants would have no reasonable prospects of success on appeal citedRandhawa v Minister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethnic Affairs     FCR   The Federal Magistrate also found that the Tribunal did assess the objective basis of the applicants  fear of the specific assailants in a location other than the land at Nadi  The applicants had indicated that they could not return to their farm at Nadi since the lease had expired  His Honour held that the Tribunal did not make a relocation finding under the principle in Randhawa v Minister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethnic Affairs     FCR   but an assessment of fear based on a changed fact situation  at     On   November   Scarlett FM dismissed the application in respect of the first  second and fourth applicants and dismissed the application in respect of the third applicant pursuant to s  A of the Act   On   April   the applicants filed an application for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal from the orders of Scarlett FM  In an affidavit filed and sworn   April   the first applicant explained that the reason for the delay was that the applicants had sought Ministerial intervention on humanitarian grounds under s   of the Act in the intervening period  The applicants received notification of the final outcome of their s   application from the Minister by letter dated   April    A draft notice of appeal was annexed to the affidavit and contains four grounds of appeal  These grounds of appeal assert that the learned Federal Magistrate had erred in failing to find jurisdictional errors in the Tribunal s decision citedS  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The first ground of appeal asserts that the Tribunal erred in failing to consider whether the second  third and fourth applicants  had a well founded fear of persecution by reason of their membership of a particular social group comprising  Indo Fijian  young  females   The Minister submitted that the sole basis on which the applicants say the Tribunal was required to consider this possibility was that the first applicant had told the Tribunal he did not want to return to Fiji because his  wife and daughters might be the victims of violence   at   of the Tribunal s reasons   The Minister contended that the context in which this statement appears does not support the applicant s claims that they advanced the argument to the Tribunal that  Indo Fijian  young  females  comprised a particular social group in Fiji  In Appellant S  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         CLR     Gleeson CJ stated at         this Court has insisted that  on judicial review  a decision of the Tribunal must be considered in the light of the basis upon which the application was made  not upon an entirely different basis which may occur to an applicant  or an applicant s lawyers  at some later stage in the process   In these circumstances  this ground cannot be sustained   The second ground of appeal asserts that the Tribunal erred in failing to consider an integer of the claims  namely  whether the applicants had a well founded fear of persecution by reason of the first applicant s support for the Fiji Labour Party at the time of the general election  The first applicant argued in his submissions that the Tribunal addressed the wrong issue in stating that  I am satisfied from the independent evidence that the party is unlikely to achieve power again in the reasonably foreseeable future  at    However  the Tribunal went on to find in the same paragraph that        there is also no evidence in the U S  State Department report for     or any of the other sources cited above that people supported it in the past  or who support it now  are being subjected to any serious discrimination or harm  either at a societal level or by agents of the state  citedSZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The third ground of appeal asserts that the Tribunal breached the requirements of s  A of the Act  The section requires that  subject to certain exceptions  the Tribunal must give an applicant in writing  clear particulars of information which it considers would be the reason  or a part of the reason  for affirming a decision that is under review  and invite the applicant to comment on that information  The information that the applicants claim the Tribunal was required to give them under s  A is particularised in the draft notice of appeal  as discrimination against Indo Fijians  through affirmative action programs for other ethnic groups  The Minister submitted that this is not  information  that attracts an obligation under s  A of the Act  see SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA         ALR   at     The Tribunal based its findings in relation to affirmative action on the U S  State Department report for    within the exception of s  a    the evidence given by the applicants to the Tribunal  within the exception of s  b    and the insufficient evidence that the applicants might be targeted for serious harm by reason of their race in the reasonably foreseeable future  not  information  within the meaning of s  A   In these circumstances  this ground cannot be sustained   The fourth ground of appeal asserts that the Tribunal failed to consider whether they had a well founded fear of persecution by reason of the first applicant s provision of his truck to the Fiji Labour Party  as opposed to his party membership  The Minister submitted that the applicants did not articulate any claim that the first applicant s provision of his truck to the Fiji Labour Party gave rise to any fear of harm as distinct from the harm they claimed to fear by reason of his party membership  nor did any such argument clearly arise from their evidence  The Tribunal referred to the first applicant s provision of his truck to the Fiji Labour Party in its reasons  at   and concluded that there is no evidence that people who supported the party in the past or present are being subjected to any serious discrimination or harm  either at a societal level or by agents of the state  at    In these circumstances  I agree with the Minister s submission and this ground must fail   In the first applicant s outline of submissions dated   August   two additional grounds of appeal are raised in addition to the four grounds in the draft notice appeal consideredSZGNO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  At the hearing before this Court  the Minister conceded that the applicants had been pointed in the direction of pursuing the s   application by the Tribunal implicitly and by the Federal Magistrate explicitly  I am mindful of the fact that the applicants are self represented and may not have obtained legal advice in pursuing one course over another  instead of pursuing both courses simultaneously  I am also mindful of the conclusion of Graham J in SZGNO v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA     where His Honour said at    In my opinion the learned Federal Magistrate has fallen into error in concluding that by making an application to the Minister under s   of the Act and the subsequent delay the Applicant thereby elected to accept the correctness of the Tribunal s decision  distinguishedSZHRZ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In the present case  there is no evidence before the Court that in electing to pursue Ministerial intervention under s     the applicants chose to abandon their rights of appeal  such as by the filing of a notice of discontinuance  cf   SZHRZ v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA    The applicants received notification of the final outcome of their s   application from the Minister by letter dated   April   and filed the application for an extension of time on   April    In my considered view  the applicants  by pursuing the s   application  should not be considered as abandoning their rights of appeal in respect of the Tribunal s decision   On the hearing of the application  I indicated to the parties that if I was minded to grant an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal  I would proceed to determine the applicants  appeal on the basis of the grounds in the draft notice of appeal and the two further grounds in the first applicant s outline of submissions
