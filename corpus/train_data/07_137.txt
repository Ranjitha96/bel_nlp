Pattison  Trustee  in the matter of Bell  Bankrupt v Bell   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedSiminton v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority   FCAFC       FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Service of the order of   September   was effected personally on Ms Bell  The order so served was endorsed with the notice required by O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   The order itself was not signed by the registrar  although it bore the stamp of the seal of the Court  The order had been so stamped in consequence of it having been filed electronically  pursuant to O   r  A e  and O   r  AC of the Federal Court Rules   In accordance with O   r  AC b  the document served had attached to it a notice of filing bearing a facsimile signature of the registrar  There is a question whether the appearance of the signature of the registrar on that notice  attached to the copy of the order served  is sufficient compliance with the requirement for signature imposed by O   r    See Siminton v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority   FCAFC       FCR   at     and see O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   The question need not be answered in the present case  because O   r   clearly applies in the case of the order of   September   to both Ms Bell and Living It Up  Ms Bell was aware of the terms of the order  and Living It Up is fixed with her knowledge  In any event  it is clear that  by the time the order of   September   was made  Ms Bell had already put it out of her power  and that of Living It Up  to comply with the order  by disposing of the proceeds of sale of the Mariners Place property in the manner I have described   The statement of charges in the notice of motion  pursuant to O   r   of the Federal Court Rules   reads as follows       The respondents failed to pay into an interest bearing trust account   operated by Kelly   Chapman Solicitors   the Account   the proceeds   of sale  after deduction of the reasonable costs and expenses of sale    of the property situated at and known as   Mariners Place  Noosa   Heads  Queensland   the Property   having       a  been ordered to do so by the Court on   June   and    b  sold the Property on or before   October           The respondents failed to pay into the Account the whole of the   proceeds of sale of the Property after deduction of the reasonable   costs and expenses of the sale by   September   having been       a  ordered to do so by the Court on   September   and      b  served with that order on   September     The power of the English courts to punish for contempt of court at the date of commencement of the Judiciary Act was clearly limited to the power to fine or the power to imprison or  in the case of a corporation  to order sequestration of the assets of the corporation  Rule      a  of the High Court Rules    Cth  presently provides that  in the case of a natural person  the order may be  that the contemnor pay a fine  be committed to prison  or both pay a fine and be committed to prison   In Siminton at   the Full Court relied upon r     of the High Court Rules as removing any doubt as to whether this Court could impose a fine for contempt of court  and as making it clear that both a fine and committal to prison were available penalties  Given that it is possible to include in the one order both a fine and a term of imprisonment  there appears to be no sound reason why the two powers should not be exercised by imposing a fine  with a term of imprisonment in default of payment of the fine  or part of the fine  in order to enforce the payment  In Viner v Australian Building Construction Employees  and Builders Labourers  Federation  No       FLR   Keely J made such an order  The order was set aside by the Full Court in Australian Building Construction Employees  and Builders Labourers  Federation v Viner     FLR   but not on the ground that it was beyond power  In Australian Industrial Group v Automotive  Food  Metals  Engineering  Printing and Kindred Industries Union of Australia   Ors   FCA       ALR   at   Merkel J suggested that  as a matter of practice in an order fining a contemnor  the Court ought always to make provision for enforcement of that order  in the event that the fine is not paid  His Honour suggested that  in most cases  it would be sufficient for the order to provide that  in default of payment  the district registrar must apply to the Court for directions concerning the enforcement of the order  If that were done  there seems little doubt that the Court would have power to impose a sentence of imprisonment upon the application for directions for enforcement  If that be the case  there seems to be no reason why the Court could not impose a sentence of imprisonment in default of payment of the fine  or part of the fine  in the first place  I am not to be taken as suggesting that the Court ought to do this in every case  There will undoubtedly be many cases in which the Court takes the view that a contempt is insufficiently serious to warrant imprisonment  and that the contemnor s means are such that other enforcement methods will be sufficient to enable the fine to be collected  if it is not paid in accordance with the order  I am satisfied  however  that a sentence of imprisonment in default of payment of a fine  or part of a fine  is a course within the powers of this Court questionedLewis v Pontypridd  Caerphilly  and Newport Railway Company     TLR   Counsel for the applicant conceded that the onus lay upon him to prove these charges beyond reasonable doubt  He did contend  however  that on any issue as to whether either of the respondents lacked the capacity or the ability to comply with an order of the Court  the onus fell on that respondent to prove that lack of capacity or inability  This contention was based on somewhat obscure authority  Lewis v Pontypridd   Caerphilly  and Newport Railway Company     TLR    The judgment of the English Court of Appeal in that case  delivered by Lord Esher MR on behalf of himself and Lindley and Rigby LJJ  is apparently not reported in any mainstream series of law reports  It is reported  not verbatim but in indirect speech  in the Times Law Reports  Apparently  the defendant company in that case had been ordered forthwith to make a junction connecting its railway line with the plaintiff s works  a junction it was obliged by Act of Parliament to create  Having failed to do the work  the company was prima facie in the position of having disobeyed a judgment  The company denied having wilfully disobeyed the judgment  Wilful disobedience was an essential element of the charge of contempt under the relevant rule of court applied in that case  Lord Esher MR s judgment is reported relevantly as follows     The directors said that the company had never been able to comply with the judgment  and therefore could not be said to have wilfully disobeyed it  If from the time when the judgment was given they had always been unable  through want of funds  to do the work  probably they could not be said to have wilfully disobeyed the judgment  But it was necessary for the directors to make that out  They said that they had never had any funds out of which they could do the work  because they had paid away all the money which they earned in the ordinary expenses of carrying on the railway  It might be that they were entitled to keep the railway going  But  in   Lord Esher MR s   opinion  they were bound  so long as this obligation was lying upon them  to keep down their expenses to the lowest point possible  They failed to show that they could not have obeyed the judgment if they had used proper economy   It is by no means clear from this report that Lord Esher MR was speaking about the legal onus of proof  when he was reported as saying that  it was necessary for the directors to make that out   His Lordship may simply have been drawing attention to the obvious need for the company to rely on evidence available from within it if it wished to contest the issue of wilfulness in that case  In my view  it would be contrary to principle to cast onto an alleged contemnor the onus of proving lack of capacity or ability to comply with a court order  It would be unthinkable that a person should be found guilty of contempt of court for failing to do something that could not be done  In my view  it lies upon anyone making an allegation that a contempt of court has been committed by a failure to perform an act required by a court order to prove that the alleged contemnor could have performed the act followedRe Bramblevale Ltd     CH   This view was applied by the English Court of Appeal in Re Bramblevale Ltd     Ch    In that case  the managing director of a company had been ordered to produce the company s books to its liquidator  At first instance  he had been found guilty of contempt of court on the basis that he was shown to have had the books in his possession on a particular date  so that it could be presumed that he still had them in his possession more than a year later  The Court of Appeal overturned the finding  holding that the managing director could not be found guilty of contempt of court unless it were proved beyond reasonable doubt that he still had the books in his possession after the order had been made  Bramblevale was cited in Witham v Holloway   HCA         CLR   at     per Brennan  Deane  Toohey and Gaudron JJ  In Witham   the question was whether the appropriate standard of proof was beyond reasonable doubt or the balance of probabilities  The case itself did not involve any issue of capacity or ability to obey the order  Nonetheless  no reservation was expressed in the citation of Bramblevale   on the basis that any onus could lie upon the alleged contemnor on any issue  See also Chelvarajah v Global Protection Pty Ltd   FCA       FCR   at     citedWitham v Holloway

www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  This leaves the question of contempt by failing to comply with para   of the order of   June    It should be noted that the statement of charge in the notice of motion alleges contempt against both respondents  but only in one respect  There is no charge of disposing of  transferring or dealing with the Mariners Place property without first giving notice in writing to the applicant no less than   days prior to such dealing  There is no charge of failing to sell the property by public auction  The only charge is failing to pay the proceeds of sale  after deduction of the reasonable costs and expenses of sale  into the trust account kept by Kelly   Chapman  In the absence of a specification in para   of the order of   June   of the time within which such a payment was required  Ms Bell was obliged to pay the proceeds of the sale into the trust account within a reasonable time of receiving them  See Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy  No     FCA   at   and      In any event  the time may not be crucial because  at least by June   when Ms Bell returned from her second trip to Tunisia  she had clearly disposed of all of the proceeds of sale otherwise than by paying them into the trust account  and thereby put it out of her power to comply with the order   As I have said  Ms Bell knew of the order of   June   throughout the time she was disposing of the proceeds of sale of the Mariners Place property  She conceded that she had the opportunity to consult the terms of the order had she chosen to do so  to ascertain what her obligations were  She chose not to do this  As I have said  this amounted to deliberate blindness on her part about the obligations the Court had imposed on her  There is no doubt that it constituted wilful disobedience of the order of the Court  It is necessary to make a finding that Ms Bell was guilty of contempt of court in relation to the failure to comply with the order of   June     The charge against Living It Up is more difficult  Living It Up was not the registered proprietor of any interest in the Mariners Place property  Its relationship to that property was that the property had been used as security for a loan from the Commonwealth Bank that enabled Living It Up to purchase the Resort to Health business  It is clear from the respondents  defence that both Ms Bell and Living It Up were liable to repay the monies borrowed from the Commonwealth Bank for this purpose  In para   of the defence  the respondents plead that  in order to complete the purchase of the Resort to Health business by Living It Up   the First and Second Respondents borrowed the sum of   from the CBA   At the time  according to the pleading  the advance was secured over the assets of the business and the Neerim Road property  Following the sale of the Neerim Road property  according to para   of the defence  Ms Bell refinanced liabilities  including that liability  so that they were  solely the liability of the First Respondent and or the Second Respondent  and were secured over a cash deposit in the name of Ms Bell  Upon the purchase of the Mariners Place property  according to para   of the defence  Ms Bell again refinanced the liabilities  including the money borrowed to purchase the business  so that they were  solely the liability of the First Respondent and or the Second Respondent  and secured over the Mariners Place property  It is unlikely that  in the refinancing  Ms Bell would have been able to persuade the Commonwealth Bank to release either her or Living It Up from liability to repay the amount borrowed  in favour of the other  It is therefore clear that  at the time when the Mariners Place property was sold  both respondents were liable to repay the amount borrowed from the Commonwealth Bank and secured on that property citedViner v Australian Building Construction Employees  and Builders Labourers  Federation  No       FLR   The power

Employees  and Builders Labourers  Federation v Viner     FLR   at   per Evatt and Deane JJ  Having been found guilty of contempt of court  Ms Bell should be ordered to pay the costs of that proceeding  No occasion appears for departing from the usual order that costs follow the event  particularly as the impecuniosity of the losing party is not regarded as a ground for refraining from making an order as to costs in most circumstances  Further  it is appropriate that the order for costs in respect of the contempt proceeding be on an indemnity basis  In effect  the applicant applies for punishment for contempt of court to vindicate the authority of the Court  He  or the creditors indemnifying him in the principal proceeding  ought not be out of pocket for costs for performing their function on behalf of the Court  Although it is clear that the proceeding for contempt is to be regarded as a separate proceeding from the principal proceeding  for the avoidance of doubt  I

person charged with contempt of the Family Court of Australia by scandalising the court was required to be tried by jury under s   of the Constitution   By majority  the High Court held that  for the purposes of s   of the Family Law Act    Cth   the Family Court s equivalent provision to s   of the Federal Court Act  contempt of court did not fall within the phrase  any offence against any law of

taken this step if it did not have the power to make a community service order in the first place  This Court certainly does not have the power to accept undertakings that it would not have the power to enforce by injunction  Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission   HCA         CLR    As a creature of statute  pursuant to the power of Parliament in Ch III of the Constitution   this Court has a different character from the Supreme Court of a State  There is a need for caution when talking of inherent powers  particularly where specific powers are conferred on the Court by statute  The terms of s   of the Federal Court Act and s   of the Judiciary Act are so specific as to make it clear that this Court is restricted to common law penalties for contempt of court  Those penalties are limited to a fine  a term of imprisonment or a combination of the two citedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Goldstar Corporation Pty Ltd  unreported  Federal

Drummond J    November   and Australian Securities   Investments Commission v Matthews   FCA       ACSR   at    discussedDerby   Co Ltd v Weldon  Nos    and       Ch   The contention of the applicant in the present case that the Court could debar the respondents from defending the proceeding  and strike out their defences  is based on a comment of Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR in Derby   Co Ltd v Weldon  Nos    and       Ch   at    In that case  the English Court of Appeal was considering whether it was appropriate for a court to grant a Mareva  type injunction in respect of assets beyond the jurisdiction of the court  Relevant to that question was the question whether such an injunction could be enforced in any event  The Master of the Rolls said     in the context of the grant of the Mareva injunction  I think that a sufficient sanction exists in the fact that  in the event of disobedience  the court could bar the defendant s right to defend  This is not a consequence which it could contemplate lightly as it would become a fugitive from a final judgment given against it without its explanations having been heard and which might well be enforced against it by other courts      Neill LJ at   and Butler Sloss LJ at   expressed agreement with the judgment of the Master of the Rolls  Each went on to deal with the issues in the case  with Neill LJ at   expressing specific agreement with what the Master of the Rolls had said about enforceability  Butler Sloss LJ did not comment specifically on that issue  It is unnecessary in the present case to debate the question whether barring the right to defend a proceeding falls within the range of penalties the Court could impose for contempt of court  Order  A of the Federal Court Rules contains specific provisions about the powers of the Court in the event of default of a party in complying with an order  Order  A r  d  provides that a respondent is in default by failing to comply with an order of the Court in a proceeding  Order  A r  c  provides that  if a respondent is in default  the Court may     if the proceeding was commenced by an application supported by a statement of claim or the Court has ordered that the proceeding continue on pleadings    give judgment against the respondent for the relief that       i  the applicant appears entitled to on the statement of claim  and      ii  the Court is satisfied it has power to grant      Order  A r  d  also provides that  if a respondent is in default  the Court may give judgment or make any other order against the respondent  Order  A r   specifically provides that O  A does not limit the power of the Court to punish for contempt  It must be the case  however  that  if the Court exercises its power to give judgment against a respondent  on the ground that the respondent has failed to comply with an order of the Court  and the giving of judgment has significant consequences for the respondent  those consequences could be taken into account as factors mitigating the exercise of the Court s powers to punish for contempt   The contempt in this case is a serious one  It involved a significant sum of money         As I have said  Ms Bell was well aware that an injunction had been granted  restricting her freedom of action in relation to the sale of the Mariners Place property  and her freedom of action to deal with the proceeds of sale if a sale were effected  She chose not to have regard to the terms of that order  She preferred to satisfy her obligations  or perceived obligations  and to spend the money for her own purposes  instead of complying with the injunction  In short  she preferred her own interests  and even her own whims  to her duty to comply with the injunction  The effect of the contempt on the administration of justice is also of major significance  If Ms Bell had complied with the injunction  the applicant would have been secure in the knowledge that he could bring the proceeding to its conclusion and  if he were to be successful  there would be a substantial asset available to satisfy the judgment and to augment the estate of the bankrupt  for the benefit of the bankrupt s creditors  There is now a powerful disincentive to the applicant in proceeding to a conclusion  because the execution of any judgment is much less likely to prove fruitful  This consequence can be ameliorated to some extent by exercising the power to give judgment summarily against Ms Bell  thereby saving the applicant from the need to expend further costs in the proceeding  but it still renders the proceeding largely fruitless for the applicant if  as appears to be the case  Ms Bell has no means of satisfying a judgment  The effect of the contempt  therefore  is to tilt the balance in the litigation heavily against the applicant   There can be little doubt that a contempt of this magnitude  coupled with the degree of culpability of Ms Bell  amounting to wilful blindness as to the terms of the order  as I have said  and to preferring to satisfy her own needs and desires  would warrant a significant term of imprisonment  Only if there are powerful mitigating factors would it be appropriate to consider a course other than imprisonment as a minimum step  It is therefore necessary to turn to the mitigating factors   Ms Bell claims that she did not understand the nature of the order and therefore that she did not intend to commit a breach of it or to demonstrate any disrespect for the Court  She has expressed her contrition for her failure to comply  and has apologised to the Court  I accept that she did not in fact understand the terms of the order  although they had been explained to her by her then counsel  and she was in possession of a copy of the order  Although I do not consider that the order is a particularly complex one  I can accept that legal terminology and drafting techniques can make an order less than wholly comprehensible to some people   The fact is  however  as I have found  that Ms Bell did not pay any heed to the order at all  She did not take the trouble to read it in the context of the conduct of the auction of the Mariners Place property  or in the context of her disposal of the proceeds of sale  She did not provide the agent responsible for the sale  or the auctioneer  with the copy of the order that she had  either for the purpose of guiding their conduct  or for the purpose of seeking guidance from them as to her own  She did not seek advice from Kelly   Chapman  who were then acting for her in the principal proceeding  She simply decided not to have regard to the order  Even when her contravention of it was pointed out to her  she took no immediate steps to remedy the contravention  Her initial explanation  in her affidavit of   September   was anything but frank as to what had happened to the proceeds  It was necessary for me to make a further order on   September   requiring Ms Bell to make an affidavit  explaining specifically the manner in which the sum of       had been expended  Even then  in her affidavit of   October   she was vague about a number of the payments she had made  Both of these affidavits were prepared by her without legal assistance  which is a partial explanation for their inadequacy  Even when she swore her affidavit of   December   prepared with the assistance of her pro bono lawyers  no further detail was provided  Only in her oral evidence  and under cross examination  was further detail about the payments obtained  Her expression of contrition and her formal apology to the Court only came about after she had received the advice of her counsel as to the seriousness of her position followedViner v Australian Building Construction Employees  and Builders Labourers  Federation  No       FLR   Although commenced by notice of motion entitled in the principal proceeding  the application for punishment for contempt of court is to be regarded as a separate proceeding in its own right  See Viner v Australian Building Construction Employees  and Builders Labourers  Federation  No       FLR   at     and Australian Building Construction Employees  and Builders Labourers  Federation v Viner     FLR   at   per Evatt and Deane JJ  Having been found guilty of contempt of court  Ms Bell should be ordered to pay the costs of that proceeding  No occasion appears for departing from the usual order that costs follow the event  particularly as the impecuniosity of the losing party is not regarded as a ground for refraining from making an order as to costs in most circumstances  Further  it is appropriate that the order for costs in respect of the contempt proceeding be on an indemnity basis  In effect  the applicant applies for punishment for contempt of court to vindicate the authority of the Court  He  or the creditors indemnifying him in the principal proceeding  ought not be out of pocket for costs for performing their function on behalf of the Court  Although it is clear that the proceeding for contempt is to be regarded as a separate proceeding from the principal proceeding  for the avoidance of doubt  I should make an order pursuant to O   r   of the Federal Court Rules that the costs of the contempt proceeding be paid forthwith
