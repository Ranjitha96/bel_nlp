claim of a well founded fear of persecution  see Abebe v Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR   at    citedAntoun v The Queen   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  His Honour there observed that it would be  rare and exceptional  for actual bias to be demonstrated solely from the published reasons for decision  There is nothing in the present case to give rise to any possible suggestion of actual bias nor can there be anything to support a claim of reasonable apprehension of bias within the principles stated by the High Court in Re Refugee Tribunal  Ex

Bankruptcy   HCA         CLR   at    followedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VSAF of     FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  As a full court observed in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VSAF of     FCAFC   at     there are  many cases showing that findings of fact are not necessarily required to support a state of non satisfaction   Section   of the Migration Act does not require the decision maker to reach a decision to refuse a visa only if a particular matter is established  As their Honours said  quoting from the decision of another full court    It  section   requires a refusal if the decision maker is not affirmatively satisfied that the criteria for the visa in question have been satisfied   It is well established that the scheme contemplated by Part   of the Migration Act expressly contemplates that in particular circumstances an appellant will not attend a hearing  including cases involving no fault of the applicant  Notwithstanding that  the Tribunal is authorised to proceed to decide the review in the applicant s absence  see VSAF of   at    See also VNAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at     For these reasons the appeal must be dismissed with costs followedNAVX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The third ground of appeal is that the Tribunal failed to consider his claims  This seems to me to be a new ground of appeal which was not a ground of review before the learned Federal Magistrate  In any event it cannot be accepted for the reasons I have already given in relation to the previous ground of appeal  Moreover  as a full court said in NAVX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at       In assessing the adequacy of these reasons  it must be kept in mind that the Tribunal had indicated to the appellant that it was unable to find in his favour on the basis of the material in its possession and invited him to attend to provide additional information  Clearly enough  the Tribunal was not obliged to accept at face value his short and very vague outline of his basis for fearing prosecution in China  Having found that the outline was not sufficient to satisfy it that the appellant had a well founded fear of persecution  it could do little more than offer his an opportunity to elaborate  When he failed to accept that opportunity  the inevitable consequence was the rejection of his application   The final ground of appeal is that the Tribunal failed to carry out its statutory duty  This appears to be a claim that there was a breach of s  A of the Migration Act   This ground is without foundation followedPrasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     FCR   It may be that the appellant seeks to raise a submission that the Tribunal had a duty to conduct its own independent inquiries  However  as Wilcox J observed in Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Ethinic Affairs     FCR   at     the circumstances under which a decision will be invalid for failure to conduct its own separate inquiries are strictly limited  There is nothing to suggest that that ground was enlivened in the present case citedRe Refugee Tribunal  Ex parte H

and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA     von Doussa J usefully summarised the principles applicable to the ground of bias  The principles are stated at   to   of his Honour s judgment and need not be repeated followedSZEFM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In SZEFM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   at     Bennett J referred to a number of authorities which show that where a Tribunal was merely  identifying deficiencies or inadequacies in the appellant s case  it cannot be said that the Tribunal was relying on information communicated to or received by the Tribunal  Rather  it was setting out its thought processes  The same principle applies here   As her Honour Bennett J said  there was no information that the Tribunal was obliged to give to the appellant by reason of s  A   Her Honour referred to the authority of a full court in
