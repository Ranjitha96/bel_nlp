SZBQV v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedWalton v Gardiner   HCA         CLR   at  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Federal magistrate was satisfied that the present application fell within the principles addressed by Mason CJ  Deane and Dawson JJ in Walton v Gardiner   HCA         CLR   at   and concluded as follows in her reasons for judgment of   January      I consider that the bringing of the current application can be considered unjustifiably vexatious amounting to an abuse of process  particularly having regard to the underlying public interest in the finality of litigation  I am satisfied that the current proceedings are an abuse of process and ought to be summarily dismissed to avoid further public expense in defending proceedings that have already taken up the resources of the Federal Magistrates Court  the Federal Court and the High Court and have raised no arguable case   It has been long established that an application for leave to appeal should fail if no arguable ground of appeal is raised by the applicant  or if the judgment below is not attended by sufficient doubt to warrant allowing the application or the appeal to go forward   The applicants have failed to identify any conceivably viable arguable ground of appeal  The draft notice of appeal and purported written submissions make unparticularised allegations of error in the Federal Magistrate s decision and of jurisdictional error in the earlier Refugee Review Tribunal s reasons for decision  The applicants  written submissions also seek in substance and reality impermissible merits review  At least in the absence of any evidence to support those allegations or any particulars in order to render the same meaningful  which is the situation here readily evident  the present purported application must necessarily fail
