contains s  F   was enacted in   following the Harmer Report and provided at that time for a wholly new regime for the administration of companies apart from the existing forms of external administration and especially winding up in insolvency  Section  A identifies the objects of the Part     A The object of this Part is to provide for the business  property and affairs of an insolvent company to be administered in a way that     a  maximises the chances of the company  or as much as possible of its business  continuing in existence  or     b  if it is not possible for the company or its business to continue in existence results in a better return for the company s creditors and members than would result from an immediate winding up of the company citedDare v Pulham   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe rule enunciated in those cases is no more than an extension of the general principles of pleading  There is more than one purpose for pleadings  One of the purposes of pleadings is to define the issues and to give the opposing party fair notice of the case that that party must meet  Dare v Pulham   HCA         CLR   at    Order   rule   of the Federal Court Rules assists to achieve that purpose by requiring a party to plead a statement in a summary form of the material facts upon which the party relies  Absent any claim for relief in the statement of claim  a respondent may properly assume such a claim is not being pursued  A court will confine a party to the party s pleadings if to do otherwise would be unjust to another party

would promote those purposes rather than a construction that would not  s  AA of the Acts Interpretation Act    Cth  Lam Soon Australia Pty Ltd v Molit  No   Pty Ltd     ACSR    The scheme of Part    A is to empower the creditors to determine the future of the company  It does so by allowing the company to appoint an administrator in circumstances where the directors are of the opinion that the company is insolvent or likely to become insolvent at some future time and resolve that an administrator should be appointed  s  A  The administrator is entrusted with the administration of the company and after his or her appointment has control of the company s business  property and affairs and has the power to carry on the company s business and manage its property and affairs  and to perform any function that the company or any of its officers could have performed if the company were not under administration  s  A  The administrator s appointment stays the powers of any officer or a provisional liquidator of the company  s  C  After his or her appointment  only an administrator can deal with the company s property  s  D  The administrator s appointment also impacts upon the members in that the members cannot  during the administration of the company  transfer shares in the company  except if the administrator consents or the Court permits  s  F  The administrator must convene a meeting of the company s creditors within eight business days of the beginning of the administration in order to determine whether to appoint a committee of creditors  s  E citedLewis and

administrator appointed   No       ACSR   was authority for the proposition that an order cannot be made after the lease is determined  I do not agree  The application with which the Court was concerned in Re Java   ACSR   was by a lessor for an order that it have leave to take possession of leasehold premises pursuant to s  C of the Corporations Act or  alternatively  a declaration under s  F of the Corporations Act   In Re Java   ACSR   the landlord  Permanent Trustee  gave notice of default under the lease for non payment of some four months rent  The notice stipulated that if the breach were not remedied Permanent Trustee would re enter the premises   days later  Five days later Permanent Trustee gave a notice said to be under s   of the Property Law Act    Vic  in relation to interest and legal costs said to be owing and warned that unless the breaches were remedied within   days Permanent Trustee would re enter without further notice  About a week after the second notice the directors of the lessee company appointed administrators to the company under s  A  The company was then still in possession of the leasehold property but the breaches in the two notices had not been remedied  During the administration two offers were made to purchase the company s business and for the purchaser to take an assignment of the lease  The administrators recommended that the creditors approve the arrangement  However  Permanent Trustee insisted that the lease had been terminated and that it was not prepared to negotiate with the prospective purchaser but had found another prospective tenant  The administrators recommended to the company s creditors that a deed of company arrangement be executed pending the sale of the business and the assignment of the lease  Permanent Trustee commenced the proceeding in the first place seeking leave to enter into possession pursuant to s  C in case the creditors resolved that the company enter into a deed of company arrangement that day because Permanent Trustee would be at risk under s  F if such a proposal were made  The application therefore before the Court was in relation to a company in administration  not a company subject to a deed of company arrangement citedRenowden v McMullin   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIf a party does not repeat a claim for relief made in the originating
