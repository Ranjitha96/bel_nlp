Secretary  Department of Employment   Workplace Relations v Homewood   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedComcare Australia v Mathieson     ALD   It is important when considering the extent of the Tribunal s obligations under s   to have regard to the words of the section  The primary obligation imposed on the Tribunal by the section is to  give reasons     for its decision   They must include but are not limited to its findings on material questions of fact and reference to the evidence on which those findings are based  It must be possible      to discern from the reasons given the actual reasoning process adopted      Comcare Australia v Mathieson     ALD   at   per Weinberg J citedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The grounds of appeal  as set out in the notice  are as follows            The Tribunal erred in law in that  by failing to include in its reasons its findings on material questions of fact  a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based  and the reasons for                    its decision that Mr Homewood would be destitute within six months  paragraph           the basis on which the Tribunal reconciled that decision with the finding  paragraph   that Mr Homewood had available assets that would realise between   and    sic    and         the Tribunal s decision that the appropriate part of the compensation payment received by Mr Homewood that should be treated as not having been made was the part that would lead to the preclusion period ending on   July   instead of   October    paragraph               the Tribunal failed to provide reasons for its decision  in contravention of the requirements of s   and  B  of the AAT Act   The Tribunal commenced its reasons by noting the agreement by the parties that the date of the accident    February   the amount of the compensation payment    and the calculation of the preclusion period    February   to   October   were not in dispute  It then said  at        The issue in contention was whether special circumstances existed that would make it appropriate to treat the compensation payment either in whole or part as not having been made   The Tribunal reviewed Mr Homewood s evidence  It dealt with that evidence largely by setting out his responses to various documentary exhibits put to him  The exhibits were not always identified with clarity   The present case is not about a failure on the part of the Tribunal to include in its reasons the findings on material questions of fact which it has made  Nor is it a complaint that the Tribunal has failed to refer to the evidence on which those findings were based  Many of the reported cases involve claims of that kind of failure see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf   HCA         CLR   at      Gleeson J     Gaudron J     McHugh  Gummow

fact and the evidence upon which those findings were based are related to the obligation to give reasons  they are independent and separate obligations      That statement neatly identifies what might be called the tripartite nature of the obligation under s    It is an obligation   i  to give reasons   ii  to include in its reasons its findings on material questions of fact       iii  to include

the sense explained earlier  In so doing it is not required to express itself with the precision that might be required of a court of law  As Morling and Wilcox JJ said in Times Consultants Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs  Qld      ALR    at        The tribunal is an administrative body and  whilst errors of law made by it are susceptible to correction by this court  its decisions should not be too closely scrutinised for the purpose of searching for errors of law in what may be imprecise language      In my opinion  the Tribunal made a finding of fact that within six months Mr Homewood would be destitute  absent the disability support pension   It had regard to his asset position in coming to that conclusion  The complaint that it has not adequately disclosed its reasons for so concluding amounts to little more than a complaint about its findings of fact   The Secretary accepted  by reference to   of the Tribunal s reasons  that the amount available for Mr Homewood s support could arguably be fixed at a lower range of between   and    That is not a reading of the Tribunal s reasons which is particularly generous to Mr Homewood  It is to be noted that the assets giving rise to those figures are comprised of  coin collections and other collectibles    boxes of items   DVDs      a motor vehicle worth less than     Having regard to the nature of the assets to which the Tribunal adverted in its reasons  its finding that Mr Homewood would be destitute within six months was open to it  That finding formed a base  in principle  for the exercise of the discretion under s  K  of the Act  The way in which it approached the exercise of that discretion was adequately explained by reference to its finding of fact  While it may be argued that a more elaborate and principled approach by reference to the rules governing the fixing of preclusion periods under the Act would have been preferable  that is not the basis upon which the Tribunal s decision is attacked in this case  It is attacked only on the basis that it has failed to give adequate reasons  In my opinion that challenge is not made out and the application should be dismissed   For the preceding reasons the application is dismissed  The applicant will be required to pay the respondent s costs      I certify that the preceding forty eight   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment
