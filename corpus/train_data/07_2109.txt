Hall v Repatriation Commission   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlrelatedHall v Repatriation Commission   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In the principal decision   Hall v Repatriation Commission   FCA     an issue was reserved as to whether or not the matter would be remitted to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  the Tribunal   The applicant now seeks an order that this Court determine the matter  rather than remit the matter to the Tribunal  Counsel for the Repatriation Commission submits that is not a step which ought to be taken and I have been referred to a series of authorities  culminating in Repatriation Commission v Butcher   FCAFC         ALD   which stress the sparing nature of the potential use of the power granted by s   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth  generally  and in particular  by s     In my opinion  that submission is contrary to the principal decision see Hall   FCA   at      In my view  once the hypothesis was found to be reasonable  and once the facts were found as the Tribunal did  then  when the concept of beyond reasonable doubt is properly understood  the Tribunal could not properly find  as required by s   of the Veteran s Entitlement Act    Cth  that there was no sufficient ground for making the determination beyond reasonable doubt   In my opinion  it is only at a very high level that to so hold may be regarded as a finding of fact  The findings of primary fact have been made by the Tribunal  and if it be a finding of fact that is made  then it seems to me that this is a very benign use of s    The course of having the matter remitted would lead to further delay and cost  and risks a misunderstanding of the effect of the principal decision if a submission such as that just made to me was made to the Tribunal   Accordingly the decision of the Repatriation Commission under review is set aside and in lieu thereof I determine that the death of Robert Thomas Butler was war caused and that the applicant  Ruth Isobel Hall  is entitled to a war widow s pension as from   February    Liberty to apply is reserved   I certify that the preceding five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles    Associate Dated    January   Counsel for the Applicant  Ms E Wood     Solicitor for the Applicant  Legal Aid Commission of NSW     Counsel for the Repatriation Commission  Miss RM Henderson     Solicitor for the Repatriation Commission  Australian Government Solicitor     Date of Hearing    December       Date of Judgment    December         AustLII  Copyright Policy   Disclaimers   Privacy Policy   Feedback   URL  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html
