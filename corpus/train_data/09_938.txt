au au cases cth FMCA  htmlThis is an appeal against a judgment of a Federal Magistrate delivered on   May     SZMXP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FMCA   in which the Federal Magistrate dismissed an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal   the Tribunal   made on   September   and handed down on   October    The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant  The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh  who arrived in Australia on   February    On   March   the appellant lodged an Application for a Protection  Class XA  visa with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship  A delegate of the first respondent refused the appellant s Application for a Protection visa on   May    On   June   the appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision  Before the Tribunal  the appellant claimed to have a well founded fear of persecution because of his involvement with the Awami League in Bangladesh  The appellant claimed that he joined the student wing of the Awami League in   while still at school  was elected president of the first year committee of the Bangladesh Chattra League at his college in   and was elected General Secretary of the Janjira Thana Awami League Committee in    He claimed that in   he was elected an Executive Member and President of the Shariatpur District Awami League Committee  The appellant also claimed that in   the BNP and other Muslim fundamentalists declared him a stranger in the area where he lived and threatened that he would be killed by a bomb blast if he did not cease to act on behalf of the Awami League  He stated that he went to the police in light of these threats  but that the police were reluctant to help him because of his Awami League involvement  He claimed that the police advised him that  if he did not leave the area  they would arrest him as they had received a complaint against him  He claimed that he fled to Dhaka  where a senior party figure organised work for him in Singapore  He claimed that  after he fled his home  BNP Jammat activists destroyed his house and threatened his family members and that the police came to his house on a number of occasions to arrest him  He stated that he returned to Bangladesh on   February   following the appointment of a caretaker government there  He claimed that  upon his return on that occasion  the police went to his home to arrest him and that  on   February   he again fled to Singapore  from where he then travelled to Australia  The Federal Magistrate held that the issues in the present case were indistinguishable from those in SZNEC   FMCA    The Federal Magistrate said   SZMXP   FMCA   at       In my view  it is clear that the outcome in this case is determined by the decision of the Full Court in SZLPO   Based upon the reasoning of the Full Court  and my own analysis of that reasoning in SZNEC   there was no breach of s   or s   B in this case  Section   does not apply because the Tribunal was not seeking additional information from a natural person  Neither  on the facts of this case  was DFAT acting as the agent of the Tribunal  Because s   does not apply  neither does s  B  It follows that no jurisdictional error in the decision of the Tribunal has been established and the application must be dismissed as a privative clause decision  I will so order followedKopalapillai v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au

matters were considered  and considered in detail  At the heart of the Tribunal s conclusion in this respect  as I have already mentioned  are questions of fact and credibility  which are matters for

www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe additional matter raised in the appellant s Written Submission is also a matter which I think the appellant has failed to make good  The Tribunal used appropriate means to contact the officer in charge at the Jagira Police Station and received a communication from that person to the effect that the alleged charges were not genuine  I do not think that this is a case where further investigation on the part of the Tribunal was required  see Prasad v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA         FCR   at     followedSZLPO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlBefore the Federal Magistrate  the appellant claimed that the Tribunal had erred because it had failed to comply with s  a  and s  B of the Migration Act    Cth    the Act    The Federal Magistrate took the view that these points were covered by the decision of the Full Court of this Court in SZLPO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC         ALR    The Federal Magistrate also relied upon a decision of his own in SZNEC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FMCA    The Federal Magistrate held that the issues in the present case were indistinguishable from those in SZNEC   FMCA    The Federal Magistrate said   SZMXP   FMCA   at       In my view  it is clear that the outcome

Tribunal  Because s   does not apply  neither does s  B  It follows that no jurisdictional error in the decision of the Tribunal has been established and the application must be dismissed as a privative clause decision  I will so order  The Federal Magistrate  in my view  correctly applied the principles to be found in SZLPO   FCAFC       ALR    In substance  the following can be gleaned from SZLPO   FCAFC       ALR     Information captured by s   of the Act must be information additional to information previously given to the Tribunal by the invitee   SZLPO   FCAFC       ALR   at       The word  person  in s   means a  natural person    SZLPO   FCAFC       ALR   at       The word  person  in s   is limited by reference to a person whose identity is known at the time of the extending of the invitation   SZLPO   FCAFC       ALR   at     and    A document is not  information  although it may contain information  and therefore s   does not apply to an invitation to a person to supply a document to the Tribunal   SZLPO   FCAFC       ALR   at      In SZLPO   FCAFC       ALR     the Full Court noted that in some circumstances  DFAT could be treated as an agent of the Tribunal  The Court noted  at   that  where the invitation from the Tribunal leaves it to the recipient of the invitation to determine who to approach  it could not be said that the recipient of the invitation was the agent of the Tribunal  However  at     the Full Court went on to say that  where the invitation from the Tribunal requests the recipient to contact a particular person  this circumstance might well suggest that the recipient was the Tribunal s agent  In the present matter  the Tribunal wrote to DFAT and requested that DFAT provide advice on the authenticity of various documents  DFAT replied  advising the Tribunal that it was highly unlikely that a judge would issue one of the letters under consideration and that it was easy in Bangladesh for someone to hire an advocate to issue letters such as the letter submitted by the appellant  DFAT further advised that the officer in charge of the Jagira Police Station in Shariatpur had described the First Information Report and charge sheet as fraudulent and had confirmed that those papers could not be found in the official record kept at that police station  The Tribunal then wrote to the appellant  pursuant to s  A  of the Act  advising him of the content of the DFAT report and putting a series of matters to him that might influence the Tribunal s decision when it was ultimately called upon to decide his application  The appellant had an opportunity to respond to the letter and he did so  His response was that the documents which he had submitted were genuine  In the end  as I have already mentioned  the Tribunal did not accept a great deal of what the appellant had to say in support of his claims  These were all essentially findings of fact  The Federal Magistrate found that  because of the binding nature of SZLPO   FCAFC       ALR     he was bound to conclude that the Tribunal had not breached s   or s  B of the Act  His Honour also held that s   of the Act did not apply because the Tribunal was not seeking additional information from a natural person  His Honour also found that DFAT was not acting as the agent of the Tribunal  In my view  the conclusions reached by the Federal Magistrate were correct  In my view  s   does not apply in the circumstances of the present case  for the reasons which the Federal Magistrate gave  In addition  the substance of the DFAT report and the sources of the information contained in that report were disclosed to the appellant in the letter which the Tribunal wrote to him and he was given appropriate particulars of those matters  Accordingly  for these reasons  I do not think that the appellant has made out Ground   citedSZNEC v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA
