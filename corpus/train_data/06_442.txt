Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  After hearing the parties on   March   the court adjourned upon the understanding that judgment would be delivered later that day  In the interim  however  the first respondent faxed further submissions  drawing attention to SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at   per Allsop J and   per Weinberg J   SZEEU    As a result  a further hearing was rescheduled for   April   to enable the applicant to obtain assistance from pro bono counsel on these further submissions   At the hearing on   April   pro bono counsel sought leave to amend the applicant s proposed notice of appeal to include the following ground of appeal     The Federal Magistrates  Court should have found that the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal was made in jurisdictional error in that the Tribunal failed to comply with s  A of the Act when the Tribunal failed to provide particulars of information to the applicant  where this information was      i  part of the reasons for its decision  and   ii  did not fall within the exception in s      Particulars       The form and content of the appellant s evidence given to the Department              The assurance about privacy contained in the letter from the Department to the  Applicant  dated   February     Counsel for the applicant submitted that the RRT breached s  A of the Act with respect to two pieces of information  i e   with respect to   the form and content of the applicant s evidence given to the Department  particularly the omission in this evidence of certain claims the applicant made to the RRT  and   the assurance about privacy contained in the letter from the Department to the applicant dated   February    She submitted that both pieces of information constituted  information  within the meaning of s  A  of the Act   and were part of the reasons for affirming the decision under review  It followed  so she said  that the RRT breached s  A when it failed to provide particulars of these pieces of information to the applicant in accordance with the Act   Further  counsel for the applicant contended that there was no alternate basis for the RRT s decision that was unaffected by the s  A error   As counsel for the applicant acknowledged  the proposed ground of appeal raised a basis for a claim of jurisdictional error on the RRT s part that had not been argued before the Federal Magistrate  The court may allow such a ground to be argued on an appeal if it is satisfied that it is expedient in the interests of justice to allow the new ground to be argued and determined  see VAAC v Minster for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR     VAAC   at     per North  Merkel and Weinberg JJ  It is only at this late stage in this proceeding that the applicant has had the benefit of counsel and this provides part of the explanation for the applicant s failure to raise the ground earlier  There is also the further fact that SZEEU was only delivered on   February    In addition to this consideration  whether or not leave ought be granted depends on such matters as the prospects of success of the proposed new ground  the prejudice to the first respondent in allowing the ground to be raised  the possible serious consequences to the applicant if the leave sought is refused  and the integrity of the appellate process  see VAAC at       The RRT s knowledge that the standard letter contained an assurance of privacy can be regarded as  information  for the purposes of s  A  The Court in SZEEU treated the discussion of the word  information  in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR     VAF   as a point of departure for its own consideration of the appeals before it  In VAF   Finn and Stone JJ said  at        T  here is now a considerable body of case law concerned with the compass of the term  information  in its s  A  setting  The following propositions emerge from it     i   the purpose of s  A is to provide in part a statutory procedural analogue to the common law of procedural fairness  Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR   at     However the obligation imposed is not coextensive with that which might be imposed by the common law to avoid practical injustice  VAAC          ii  the word  information  in s  A  has the same meaning as in s   Win v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR   at     and in this setting it refers to knowledge of relevant facts or circumstances communicated to or received by the Tribunal  Tin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at     irrespective of whether it is reliable or has a sound factual basis  Win   at     and    iii  the word does not encompass the Tribunal s subjective appraisals  thought processes or determinations  Tin at   Paul at   Singh v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at     approved   FCAFC     nor does it extend to identified gaps  defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the Tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps  etc  WAGP of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at          The Court in SZEEU accepted that the word  information  in s  A refers to  knowledge of relevant facts or circumstances communicated to or received by the Tribunal  see SZEEU at     per Moore J  at       per Weinberg J and   per Allsop J  although Allsop J stated  at   that there were limits on the statement in VAF that  information  did not encompass or extend to identified gaps  defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the RRT in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps   On a fair reading of the RRT s reasons for its decision  the RRT s knowledge that the standard letter contained an assurance of privacy was knowledge that the RRT considered was a part of the reason it affirmed the decision under review  In SZEEU   Weinberg J discussed  at   the application of the expression  a part of the reason  in s  A   observing that     The strict view that the courts have taken in relation to breaches of natural justice can  in my view  inform the application of the expression  a part of the reason  in s  A  The cases suggest that this expression should be read benevolently  in favour of an applicant for review  If there is any doubt as to whether information that is adverse to an applicant did form a part of the reason for decision  that doubt should generally be resolved in favour of the applicant   His Honour accepted  at   that  the similar claims information  in the case of SZBMI  played a part     in the Tribunal s conclusion  and therefore constituted a part of the reason for its decision  Weinberg J explained  at   that     The fact is that the Tribunal regarded the similar claims information as a significant matter  sufficiently important to warrant specific mention  Although the Tribunal dealt with the matter as though it simply bolstered a conclusion that it had already arrived at  rather than an element in the decision making process  it does not follow that it did not play  a part  in its reasons for decision      The actual process by which a decision is reached is  of course  a complex matter  It is not always as neat as the reasons themselves may suggest  The reasoning may not proceed in a linear fashion  and the Tribunal s reasons must  of course  be read as a whole   Allsop J  in SZEEU at     explained the application of the expression  a part of the reason  as follows     In my view  in the light of  SAAP Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR     in circumstances where one is faced with a decision of the Tribunal with reasons and the complaint is a contravention of s  A    the question to ask  by reference to the reasons of the Tribunal in the context in which one finds them  as revealing what would be the reason or a part of the reason for affirming the decision immediately prior to the making of the decision  is whether the information in question was a part  that is any part  of the reason for affirming the decision  To the extent that the reasons of the relevant majorities in  Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Afairs   FCA         FCR   and VAF can be seen to require that the relevant part of the reason have a stature or importance  or be of a character  which would make it unfair not to invoke the procedures of s  A   I think SAAP requires that such an approach be rejected  It is only necessary that the information be a part of the reason      That said  it is necessary to recognise the guidance that one nevertheless receives from aspects of   in VAF   One always needs to analyse and interpret the reason s of the Tribunal in order to understand the reason for the ultimate reason or conclusion of the lack of satisfaction of the existence of protection obligations  Merely because something is contained in the text of the reasons of the Tribunal which involves  information  does not conclude the question whether it was  and  in the relevant sense  would be  a part of the reason for affirming the decision  The whole of the written reasons must be analysed and interpreted in their context to assess why it was that the Tribunal acted as it did  and so  in the relevant sense  to assess what would be  prior to making the decision  the reason or a part of the reason   Having thus ascertained the reason or reasons  if there be more than one  why the Tribunal was not relevantly satisfied  any information that was  and thus  in the relevant sense  would be  a part of the reasoning process to explain such reason engages the operation of s  A   without any additional requirement  for which Paul and VAF appear to call  that the relative importance of the information to the reasoning process be assessed to form a judgment as to whether fairness requires the engagement of s  A  The above tasks of assessment or interpretation of the Tribunal s reasons  of ascertaining what was any reasoning process and of assessing the relevance of any information thereto may not be straightforward and may lead to conclusions about which minds may differ   The observations of Weinberg and Allsop JJ in SZEEU are helpful in this case  because  clearly enough  the standard letter played a part in the RRT s reasons for its decision  even if only a subsidiary part  see also SZEEU at   agreeing with Allsop J at   above  As previously noted  before the RRT  the applicant claimed that he feared persecution based on his own association with the LTTE  although he had not mentioned these claims until he gave evidence at the RRT hearing   The RRT rejected this claim about his own involvement with the LTTE as  not credible  because  if genuine  the applicant would have mentioned the claim to the delegate or in his statement seeking review of the delegate s decision  The RRT rejected the applicant s explanation for his failure to mention the claim earlier on the joint bases of importance and confidentiality  In relation to confidentiality  the RRT referred to the assurances given both at the interview with the delegate and in the standard letter  The reference to the standard letter was apparently intended to take account of the fact that the applicant said that he could not recall being given such an assurance at the interview with the delegate  In effect  the standard letter was a part of the RRT s reasons for its decision because it provided a part of the reason for rejecting the applicant s explanation as to why he gave an account of personal involvement so late in the piece and thus for disbelieving this account  There were not  as the respondent maintained  three separate bases for the RRT s rejection of the applicant s explanation for failing to mention his own LTTE involvement until the oral hearing before the RRT  The matter of the standard letter was intertwined with the RRT s view that the applicant s explanation for his late claims should be rejected because of earlier assurances of confidentiality   As noted earlier  the first respondent also contended that  even if there were a breach in this regard  the decision of the RRT was supportable on an independent basis that was not affected by the breach  This was that the RRT would have found the applicant s account not credible also on the basis that it did not find his evidence plausible  I reject this submission because  read fairly and as a whole  the RRT s finding that the applicant was not credible flowed from its determination that  if true  the applicant would have made his personal involvement claim earlier and its assessment that his evidence was vague  unresponsive and implausible  That is  the RRT treated these two considerations as supporting  together or cumulatively  its credibility finding  The RRT expressed the idea of cumulation when it said that it  also gives weight to the fact  that the applicant s evidence was general  unresponsive and implausible  Reading the RRT s reasons as a whole  it is plain enough that it relied on  recent invention  and  implausibility  as jointly founding its credibility finding  The RRT did not treat implausibility as a stand alone basis for rejecting his claim on credibility grounds referred toVAAC v Minster for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  As counsel for the applicant acknowledged  the proposed ground of appeal raised a basis for a claim of jurisdictional error on the RRT s part that had not been argued before the Federal Magistrate  The court may allow such a ground to be argued on an appeal if it is satisfied that it is expedient in the interests of justice to allow the new ground to be argued and determined  see VAAC v Minster for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR     VAAC   at     per North  Merkel and Weinberg JJ  It is only at this late stage in this proceeding that the applicant has had the benefit of counsel and this provides

ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Allsop J  in SZEEU at     explained the application of the expression  a part of the reason  as follows     In my view  in the light of  SAAP Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR     in circumstances where one is faced with a decision of the Tribunal with reasons and the complaint is a

may not be straightforward and may lead to conclusions about which minds may differ   The effect of SAAP Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   is that s  A of the Act requires the RRT  at the hearing stage  to give the applicant  particulars  in writing of any information that would be the reason  or a part of the reason  for affirming the decision under review  and any breach of this requirement constitutes jurisdictional error   In view of this conclusion  it is unnecessary to consider the applicant s counsel s further submission concerning the form and content of the applicant s evidence given to the Department  I observe that the first respondent s counsel noted  in argument  that he had no notice of this latter submission prior to the   April hearing  although no blame attaches to pro bono counsel for this apparent fact   If leave to amend the notice of appeal were granted and an extension of time were granted  the appeal would succeed  The first respondent has not argued that  if the court so concluded  then it should not grant leave because of any countervailing considerations  Accordingly  I would grant leave to amend the proposed notice of appeal in the terms sought by pro bono counsel  I would also grant the extension of time the applicant sought and I would allow the appeal  with costs
