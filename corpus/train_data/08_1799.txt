O Shea v Heinemann Electric Pty Ltd   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAustralian and New Zealand Banking Group Limited v Financial Services Union of Australia     IR   In Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Limited v Financial Services Union of Australia     IR   at   the Full Court  Black CJ  Wilcox and von Doussa JJ  considered the circumstances in which a payment under contract could discharge an obligation under an award  Their Honours quoted the Full Court in Poletti v Ecob  No       IR   at    at         In Poletti v Ecob  at       the Full Court made this comment           It is to be noted that there are two separate situations dealt with in the passage from the judgment of Sheldon J which has been quoted and in the reasoning of the Commission in Pacific Publications   The first situation is that in which the parties to a contract of employment have agreed that a sum or sums of money will be paid and received for specific purposes  over and above or extraneous to award entitlements  In that situation  the contract between the parties prevents the employer afterwards claiming that payments made pursuant to the contractual obligation can be relied on in satisfaction of award entitlements arising outside the agreed purpose of the payments  The second situation is that in which there are outstanding award entitlements  and a sum of money is paid by the employer to the employee  If that sum is designated by the employer as being for a purpose other than the satisfaction of the award entitlements  the employer cannot afterwards claim to have satisfied the award entitlements by means of the payment  The former situation is a question of contract  The latter situation is an application of the common law rules governing payments by a debtor to a creditor  In the absence of a contractual obligation to pay and apply moneys to a particular obligation  where a debtor has more than one obligation to a creditor  it is open to the debtor  either before or at the time of making a payment  to appropriate it to a particular obligation  If no such appropriation is made  then the creditor may apply the payment to whichever obligation or obligations he or she wishes  see Halsbury s Laws of England    th ed  vol   pars   and    followedBriginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au

further facts     In respect of how overtime was worked at the factory  there were differences in the practices of different sections of the factory  Generally  overtime shifts lasted for approximately two hours  from     pm to     pm  and between one and   of the factory employees might work on any given evening  However  some sections regularly worked overtime and other sections worked overtime infrequently  The assembly workers generally worked minimal overtime  whilst the qualified fitters were called on frequently to perform overtime because of their specialised skills  It was also clear from the evidence of both Mr Ross  the General Manager of Heinemann  and Mr Aspinall  a Factory Manager of Heinemann  as well as from the employees  that there was not a practice of relying on overtime rosters  Instead  notice of overtime was commonly given to employees either on the day before or on the day that overtime was required  Employees then had an opportunity to accept or decline the extra hours  The evidence was that there was never any difficulty in finding employees to perform the additional work and that employees ordinarily accepted the work  It is also clear that employees could and did decline overtime work without ascribing any cause or reason     There was no evidence of Heinemann s overtime requirements on the days in question  There was no evidence of whether any employees actually performed overtime that week  Heinemann did not have overtime records for         and   August    The handwritten notations on the questionnaires show which employees of those interviewed were and were not available for overtime over the life of the overtime ban  and a reason for not working overtime  However  they do not indicate whether Heinemann required overtime on any evening  and if so  how much overtime was required  whether requests were made of employees to perform overtime  or whether any employee performed any requested overtime on any evening      Nevertheless  it was uncontested that the employees in Column   of the table engaged in the ban on overtime on the days in question  and that they were not paid wages referrable to these days  In addition  Heinemann also failed to pay Ms Maria Barros for the days in question on the basis that she too was implementing the ban on overtime  The applicant submits that Ms Barros was not in fact implementing the ban and should have been paid in full for those days irrespective of the operation of s      MS BARROS     It is convenient to first consider the position of Ms Barros  Ms Barros failed to answer any questions asked of her in the questionnaire  She was initially questioned by her manager  Mr Aspinall  and later by Mr Ross  Her questionnaire was annotated simply   Will not answer any questions  Do not understand   Mr Ross wrote at the end of Ms Barros  questionnaire that he had explained to Ms Barros the position in detail  He was referring to informing those employees  who had confirmed that they were enforcing the ban that they would not be paid for the duration of the overtime ban or any industrial action  Mr Ross told the Court that he believed Ms Barros understood his explanation  Ms Barros told the Court that she did not understand  She said her failure to answer was because she did not know what overtime Mr Aspinall and Mr Ross were referring to  as she rarely performed overtime  and she did not want to answer before speaking with her union representative      Ms Barros agreed that she participated in the strike of   August   and participated in the six week strike which commenced on   August    Heinemann submitted that Ms Barros  participation in the strikes goes some way to demonstrate that she also participated in the ban on overtime  This does not necessarily follow  although it is a factor to consider in the balance  as to the likelihood of the happening of events  Heinemann also contended that Ms Barros  evidence was unreliable because of the discrepancy in her affidavit evidence and the documentary evidence showing the amount of overtime she had in fact worked previously      My own assessment of the evidence is this  Ms Barros cannot understand English very well  she deposed to this  and it was apparent from her cross examination  She said she was very confused about the questions asked of her by Mr Aspinall and Mr Ross  and she appeared confused under cross examination both as to what was being asked of her by Counsel and as to the overtime position  In my view  despite the belief of Mr Ross  she was confused  Ms Barros had little understanding of the matters being asked of her by Counsel  and I consider had little understanding of the matters put to her by Mr Aspinall and Mr Ross at the time of the questionnaire     While I consider that Ms Barros was endeavouring to tell the truth  her recollection as to when her overtime was in fact taken was faulty  She did indicate that she would go to the Union for advice  which had implemented overtime bans  She did participate in the strike of   August   and the six week strike commencing on   August    In my view  it is more than likely that she did engage in the overtime bans by following the Union s approach      In any event  in view of Ms Barros  obvious confusion  I cannot be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that it has been demonstrated by the applicant that Ms Barros was entitled to be paid in full irrespective of the operation of s    The onus rests on the applicant to demonstrate this element of the case  in respect of Ms Barros  on the balance of probabilities  see Briginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR   as explained in Neat Holdings Pty Ltd v Karajan Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         ALR        Therefore  in relation to Ms Barros  I place her in the same category as the other employees listed in Column   of the table   OPERATION OF SECTION       I now turn to the main issue in this proceeding  the operation of s   of the Act  which is in the following terms  Payments not to be made or accepted in relation to periods of industrial action         This section applies if an employee engaged  or engages  in industrial action  whether or not protected action  in relation to an employer on a day     The employer must not make a payment to an employee in relation to             a  if the total duration of the industrial action on that day is less than   hours    hours of that day  or   b  otherwise  the total duration of the industrial action on that day            If           a  the industrial action is during a shift  or other period of work  and   b  the shift  or other period of work  occurs partly on   day and partly on the next day            then  for the purposes of this section  the shift is taken to be a day and the remaining parts of the days are taken not to be part of that day     For the purposes of subsection   overtime is taken not to be a separate shift     An employee must not accept a payment from an employer if the employer would contravene subsection   by making the payment                    The definition of industrial action is found in s   of the Act  It provides the following  Meaning of industrial action       For the purposes of this Act  industrial action means any action of the following kinds             a  the performance of work by an employee in a manner different from that in which it is customarily performed  or the adoption of a practice in relation to work by an employee  the result of which is a restriction or limitation on  or a delay in  the performance of the work   b  a ban  limitation or restriction on the performance of work by an employee or on the acceptance of or offering for work by an employee   c  a failure or refusal by employees to attend for work or a failure or refusal to perform any work at all by employees who attend for work   d  the lockout of employees from their employment by the employer of the employees  but does not include the following   e  action by employees that is authorised or agreed to by the employer of the employees   f  action by an employer that is authorised or agreed to by or on behalf of employees of the employer             g  action by an employee if           i  the action was based on a reasonable concern by the employee about an imminent risk to his or her health or safety  and   ii  the employee did not unreasonably fail to comply with a direction of his or her employer to perform other available work  whether at the same or another workplace  that was safe and appropriate for the employee to perform      For the purposes of this Act         a  conduct is capable of constituting industrial action even if the conduct relates to part only of the duties that employees are required to perform in the course of their employment  and   b  a reference to industrial action includes a reference to a course of conduct consisting of a series of industrial actions        It is unnecessary here to consider the definition of industrial action in s   of the Act in much detail  It is uncontested between the parties that the employees engaged in industrial action within the meaning of s  b  of the Act for the purposes of s    It is well accepted that part performance of work  or performance of work other than as directed  amounts to industrial action  An ongoing ban on the operation of a certain machine  or on performing certain tasks  while otherwise completing a full day s work  is industrial action  A lock out from  or a ban on  performing overtime  where overtime is not required or expected under a contract of employment may constitute industrial action      In Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union v Master Builders  Association of Victoria   FCA         FCR     Goldberg J considered the meaning of the expression  preventing employees from performing work  for the purposes of the then s  ML   His Honour was addressing the question of whether preventing employees from performing overtime work that they did not have a right to perform under their contracts of employment could constitute a lock out under that provision  His Honour said at    at     The expression  preventing  in the context of s  ML  involves the doing of an act which has the consequence that employees cannot perform work which  if performed  would be work performed under their contracts of employment  The concept of  preventing  in the context of s  ML  is not limited to a situation of putting up a barrier or bar to something which is going to happen in the absence of some supervening event stopping it  it also covers a situation where something is stopped in circumstances where if it was allowed or granted it would occur in a particular way    The same analysis can be applied in the circumstance here  where these employees imposed a ban on the performance of overtime even where there was no contractual obligation or right to perform it  Using the words of s  b  of the Act  it was a ban  on the acceptance of or offering for work       The main dispute in this proceeding between the parties was whether the overtime ban constituted ongoing industrial action commencing at the time specified in the notice advising of overtime bans  being the morning of   August   and continuing until the ban was removed  after   August   or whether there were a series of industrial actions in relation to overtime separated by days of ordinary work     As I have indicated  Heinemann contended that it was prohibited by the operation of s   of the Act from paying the employees any wages for any of the days         and   August    It said that the notice of intention to take protected action  which included the overtime bans  served on Heinemann by the Union was in terms that imposed an ongoing ban on performing overtime  commencing on Tuesday    August   and continuing for   months or until agreement was reached on the terms of a new Union collective agreement  Heinemann also contended that the company enquired with the employees whether they intended to implement the ban and the employees advised Heinemann of their intention to do so  Heinemann contended that the ban was clearly in place  and was not lifted and reapplied on a daily basis and as such it constituted ongoing industrial action      The applicant contended that the industrial action implemented by the employees was a series of bans either from     pm each day until the start of the shift the following day  or for a two hour period between     pm and     pm each day being the time that an ordinary overtime shift takes place at the factory      In resolving the main dispute between the parties  it is important to understand and appreciate the purpose of s    There has been no judicial consideration of the legislative purpose of s   although some consideration has been given to its predecessor  s  AA of the pre reform Act  In Independent Education Union of Australia v Canonical Administrators     FCR     Ryan J discussed the policy behind s  AA of the pre reform Act  which operated similarly to s   to prohibit the payment of  strike pay   His Honour said at     I consider that s  AA in the context of Pt VIIIA of the WR Act evinces a policy that collective bargaining should occur in an environment where employer and employee are to appreciate and accept the detrimental consequences for themselves of industrial action used as part of the negotiating armoury  For the employee those consequences are normally loss of remuneration in respect of the period of the industrial action and for the employer they are the loss of production attendant on a lockout  Consistently with that policy  s  AA is framed to ensure that the loss of remuneration is not recouped after the bargaining is over and necessarily applies to protected action    Justice Lander also commented on the legislative purpose of s  AA of the pre reform Act in Ponzio v B   P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR    His Honour said at      at          The policy of the Act is to discourage industrial action as it is defined in s   of the Act  The purpose of Pt VIIIA of the Act  in which these provisions are contained  is to prevent an employer making a payment to the employer s employee in relation to any period during which the employee engages in industrial action  It is the intention of the Act to discourage employers and employees agreeing to the employer paying employees for that period of industrial action engaged in by the employee  To that end  s  AA makes it a contravention for an employer to make a payment to an employee who has in relation to a period during which the employee engaged or engages in industrial action and at the same time makes it a contravention for the employee to accept a payment from an employer if by doing so the employer will contravene subs   by making that payment  The policy of the Act is that if an employee engages in industrial action then it must be at the employee s own expense  The purpose of s  AB is to discourage unions and their officers from making claims for a payment or engaging in or threatening to engage in or organising industrial action for the purpose of coercing the employer to make a payment to an employee during a period of industrial action  That section has as its added purpose a protection to the employer in the event that a union or its members engage in that further industrial action     Industrial action is discouraged by putting the cost of that industrial action upon the employee rather than the employer  No doubt it is thought that an employee will be less likely to take industrial action if the employee knows that it is a contravention for both the employer and the employee if the employer makes a payment for the period of industrial action    Both Ryan and Lander JJ s considerations of the policy standing behind s  AA suggest that the purpose of that provision was to make employees carry the expense of any industrial action engaged in by them  Neither Ryan or Lander JJ considered that the provision was intended to operate more broadly to punish the parties for engaging in protected industrial action beyond shouldering the burden of the actual economic loss resulting from the action     Section   is in different terms to s  AA  although basically the same purpose behind the provision is as set out by Ryan and Lander JJ in their consideration of its predecessor      However  it is important to observe that s   sets out a calculation to assess how many hours  pay an employer must withhold from an employee who engages in industrial action on a day  depending on whether the employee engages in industrial action for a period less than four hours or four hours or more  The effect of the subsection is that an employee who engages in industrial action for any period less than four hours in a day  even if it is a period of five or ten minutes  must have four hours of pay withheld  Notably  an employee who engages in industrial action for four hours or more in a day must not be paid in relation to the period of industrial action on that day  but may be paid in relation to hours worked  For example  an employee who takes industrial action for five hours in a day but works the other     hours of an ordinary day must not be paid in relation to   hours of the day but is entitled to payment in relation to     hours     It seems one purpose of the operation of s   is to deter industrial action for minor grievances  An employee will seriously consider stopping work for just five minutes if the consequence is losing a half day s pay  On the other hand  I do not consider the provision to be punitive  If it were  the provision would operate to deduct a full day s pay from an employee who engages in four hours or more industrial action on a day  Rather the intention seems to be to ensure that industrial action is not taken lightly and that the employee who engages in industrial action bears the economic consequences of that industrial action     The Court must construe the words of s   in context  Part of the context of s   is that there is a right to take protected action  Another part of the context is that  because of other provisions of the Act  there is a right ordinarily to be paid for the work undertaken  Another part of the context is that the Act is trying to ensure that either employer or employee bears the financial consequence of loss of production  in the case of a lock out  the employer  in the case of a strike  the employee citedByrne v Australian Airlines Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It was accepted that one cannot contract out of award provisions  see Josephson v Walker     CLR   at   Byrne v Australian Airlines Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   Textile  Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Givoni Pty Ltd     IR   at    However  the parties agreed that there was  in theory  no barrier to compromising or satisfying a claim arising under the Act for underpayment of wages  The compromise or settlement of a claim in accord and satisfaction was distinguishable from a contracting out scenario where an employer seeks to avoid award obligations by entering into an employment agreement that strips away award rights consideredCodelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of New South Wales   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I have ignored the expressions of subjective intention of the employees  although such were in evidence before me  Obviously  the subjective intentions of any party should not be taken into account when construing an agreement  see eg  DTR Nominees Pty Ltd v Mona Homes Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   and Pacific Carriers Limited v BNP Paribas     CLR          Of course  the objective background which I may consider does include the purposes and assumptions shared by the parties  see Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of New South Wales   HCA         CLR        It is the fact of their concurrence by the parties which converts what would otherwise be  subjective intention  into objective elements of an agreement s context  Relevantly  in this proceeding  as I will return to later  I take into account Heinemann s position made known to the Union and the employees that it could not make any payment by reason of s   of the Act  and the fact that the issue of the unpaid wages in respect of the overtime ban was not up for discussion or consideration by Heinemann at the time of entering each sign on bonus agreement citedConstruction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union v Master Builders

As I have indicated  Heinemann contended that it was prohibited by the operation of s   of the Act from paying the employees any wages for any of the days         and   August    It said that the notice of intention to take protected action  which included the overtime bans  served on Heinemann by the Union was in terms that imposed an ongoing ban on performing overtime  commencing on Tuesday    August   and continuing for   months or until agreement was reached on the terms of a new Union collective agreement  Heinemann also contended that the company enquired with the employees whether they intended to implement the ban and the employees advised Heinemann of their intention to do so  Heinemann contended that the ban was clearly in place  and was not lifted and reapplied on a daily basis and as such it constituted ongoing industrial action      The applicant contended that the industrial action implemented by the employees was a series of bans either from     pm each day until the start of the shift the following day  or for a two hour period between     pm and     pm each day being the time that an ordinary overtime shift takes place at the factory      In resolving the main dispute between the parties  it is important to understand and appreciate the purpose of s    There has been no judicial consideration of the legislative purpose of s   although some consideration has been given to its predecessor  s  AA of the pre reform Act  In Independent Education Union of Australia v Canonical Administrators     FCR     Ryan J discussed the policy behind s  AA of the pre reform Act  which operated similarly to s   to prohibit the payment of  strike pay   His Honour said at     I consider that s  AA in the context of Pt VIIIA of the WR Act evinces a policy that collective bargaining should occur in an environment where employer and employee are to appreciate and accept the detrimental consequences for themselves of industrial action used as part of the negotiating armoury  For the employee those consequences are normally loss of remuneration in respect of the period of the industrial action and for the employer they are the loss of production attendant on a lockout  Consistently with that policy  s  AA is framed to ensure that the loss of remuneration is not recouped after the bargaining is over and necessarily applies to protected action    Justice Lander also commented on the legislative purpose of s  AA of the pre reform Act in Ponzio v B   P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR    His Honour said at      at          The policy of the Act is to discourage industrial action as it is defined in s   of the Act  The purpose of Pt VIIIA of the Act  in which these provisions are contained  is to prevent an employer making a payment to the employer s employee in relation to any period during which the employee engages in industrial action  It is the intention of the Act to discourage employers and employees agreeing to the employer paying employees for that period of industrial action engaged in by the employee  To that end  s  AA makes it a contravention for an employer to make a payment to an employee who has in relation to a period during which the employee engaged or engages in industrial action and at the same time makes it a contravention for the employee to accept a payment from an employer if by doing so the employer will contravene subs   by making that payment  The policy of the Act is that if an employee engages in industrial action then it must be at the employee s own expense  The purpose of s  AB is to discourage unions and their officers from making claims for a payment or engaging in or threatening to engage in or organising industrial action for the purpose of coercing the employer to make a payment to an employee during a period of industrial action  That section has as its added purpose a protection to the employer in the event that a union or its members engage in that further industrial action     Industrial action is discouraged by putting the cost of that industrial action upon the employee rather than the employer  No doubt it is thought that an employee will be less likely to take industrial action if the employee knows that it is a contravention for both the employer and the employee if the employer makes a payment for the period of industrial action    Both Ryan and Lander JJ s considerations of the policy standing behind s  AA suggest that the purpose of that provision was to make employees carry the expense of any industrial action engaged in by them  Neither Ryan or Lander JJ considered that the provision was intended to operate more broadly to punish the parties for engaging in protected industrial action beyond shouldering the burden of the actual economic loss resulting from the action     Section   is in different terms to s  AA  although basically the same purpose behind the provision is as set out by Ryan and Lander JJ in their consideration of its predecessor      However  it is important to observe that s   sets out a calculation to assess how many hours  pay an employer must withhold from an employee who engages in industrial action on a day  depending on whether the employee engages in industrial action for a period less than four hours or four hours or more  The effect of the subsection is that an employee who engages in industrial action for any period less than four hours in a day  even if it is a period of five or ten minutes  must have four hours of pay withheld  Notably  an employee who engages in industrial action for four hours or more in a day must not be paid in relation to the period of industrial action on that day  but may be paid in relation to hours worked  For example  an employee who takes industrial action for five hours in a day but works the other     hours of an ordinary day must not be paid in relation to   hours of the day but is entitled to payment in relation to     hours     It seems one purpose of the operation of s   is to deter industrial action for minor grievances  An employee will seriously consider stopping work for just five minutes if the consequence is losing a half day s pay  On the other hand  I do not consider the provision to be punitive  If it were  the provision would operate to deduct a full day s pay from an employee who engages in four hours or more industrial action on a day  Rather the intention seems to be to ensure that industrial action is not taken lightly and that the employee who engages in industrial action bears the economic consequences of that industrial action     The Court must construe the words of s   in context  Part of the context of s   is that there is a right to take protected action  Another part of the context is that  because of other provisions of the Act  there is a right ordinarily to be paid for the work undertaken  Another part of the context is that the Act is trying to ensure that either employer or employee bears the financial consequence of loss of production  in the case of a lock out  the employer  in the case of a strike  the employee followedDTR Nominees Pty Ltd v Mona Homes Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I have ignored the expressions of subjective intention of the employees  although such were in evidence before me  Obviously  the subjective intentions of any party should not be taken into account when construing an agreement  see eg  DTR Nominees Pty Ltd v Mona Homes Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   and Pacific Carriers Limited v BNP Paribas     CLR          Of course  the objective background which I may consider does include the purposes and assumptions shared by the parties  see Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of New South Wales   HCA         CLR        It is the fact of their concurrence by the parties which converts what would otherwise be  subjective intention  into objective elements of an agreement s context  Relevantly  in this proceeding  as I will return to later  I take into account Heinemann s position made known to the Union and the employees that it could not make any payment by reason of s   of the Act  and the fact that the issue of the unpaid wages in respect of the overtime ban was not up for discussion or consideration by Heinemann at the time of entering each sign on bonus agreement citedIndependent Education Union of Australia v Canonical Administrators     FCR    There were employees at the factory as at August   and during the period of the overtime bans who did not engage in the overtime ban  but nevertheless received the sign on bonus  These included A Rico  F Bacosa  LJ Ferdinads  TL Pui  EF Gonzales  VD Wijeyeratne  SS Chan  SH Chan

 C Reinink  F Manuse  O Grah      FURTHER FACTS     It is necessary to refer to some further facts     In respect of how overtime was worked at the factory  there were differences in the practices of different sections of the factory  Generally  overtime shifts lasted for approximately two hours  from     pm to     pm  and between one and   of the factory employees might work on any given evening  However  some sections regularly worked overtime and other sections worked overtime infrequently  The assembly workers generally worked minimal overtime  whilst the qualified fitters were called on frequently to perform overtime because of their specialised skills  It was also clear from the evidence of both Mr Ross  the General Manager of Heinemann  and Mr Aspinall  a Factory Manager of Heinemann  as well as from the employees  that there was not a practice of relying on overtime rosters  Instead  notice of overtime was commonly given to employees either on the day before or on the day that overtime was required  Employees then had an opportunity to accept or decline the extra hours  The evidence was that there was never any difficulty in finding employees to perform the additional work and that employees ordinarily accepted the work  It is also clear that employees could and did decline overtime work without ascribing any cause or reason     There was no evidence of Heinemann s overtime requirements on the days in question  There was no evidence of whether any employees actually performed overtime that week  Heinemann did not have overtime records for         and   August    The handwritten notations on the questionnaires show which employees of those interviewed were and were not available for overtime over the life of the overtime ban  and a reason for not working overtime  However  they do not indicate whether Heinemann required overtime on any evening  and if so  how much overtime was required  whether requests were made of employees to perform overtime  or whether any employee performed any requested overtime on any evening      Nevertheless  it was uncontested that the employees in Column   of the table engaged in the ban on overtime on the days in question  and that they were not paid wages referrable to these days  In addition  Heinemann also failed to pay Ms Maria Barros for the days in question on the basis that she too was implementing the ban on overtime  The applicant submits that Ms Barros was not in fact implementing the ban and should have been paid in full for those days irrespective of the operation of s      MS BARROS     It is convenient to first consider the position of Ms Barros  Ms Barros failed to answer any questions asked of her in the questionnaire  She was initially questioned by her manager  Mr Aspinall  and later by Mr Ross  Her questionnaire was annotated simply   Will not answer any questions  Do not understand   Mr Ross wrote at the end of Ms Barros  questionnaire that he had explained to Ms Barros the position in detail  He was referring to informing those employees  who had confirmed that they were enforcing the ban that they would not be paid for the duration of the overtime ban or any industrial action  Mr Ross told the Court that he believed Ms Barros understood his explanation  Ms Barros told the Court that she did not understand  She said her failure to answer was because she did not know what overtime Mr Aspinall and Mr Ross were referring to  as she rarely performed overtime  and she did not want to answer before speaking with her union representative      Ms Barros agreed that she participated in the strike of   August   and participated in the six week strike which commenced on   August    Heinemann submitted that Ms Barros  participation in the strikes goes some way to demonstrate that she also participated in the ban on overtime  This does not necessarily follow  although it is a factor to consider in the balance  as to the likelihood of the happening of events  Heinemann also contended that Ms Barros  evidence was unreliable because of the discrepancy in her affidavit evidence and the documentary evidence showing the amount of overtime she had in fact worked previously      My own assessment of the evidence is this  Ms Barros cannot understand English very well  she deposed to this  and it was apparent from her cross examination  She said she was very confused about the questions asked of her by Mr Aspinall and Mr Ross  and she appeared confused under cross examination both as to what was being asked of her by Counsel and as to the overtime position  In my view  despite the belief of Mr Ross  she was confused  Ms Barros had little understanding of the matters being asked of her by Counsel  and I consider had little understanding of the matters put to her by Mr Aspinall and Mr Ross at the time of the questionnaire     While I consider that Ms Barros was endeavouring to tell the truth  her recollection as to when her overtime was in fact taken was faulty  She did indicate that she would go to the Union for advice  which had implemented overtime bans  She did participate in the strike of   August   and the six week strike commencing on   August    In my view  it is more than likely that she did engage in the overtime bans by following the Union s approach      In any event  in view of Ms Barros  obvious confusion  I cannot be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that it has been demonstrated by the applicant that Ms Barros was entitled to be paid in full irrespective of the operation of s    The onus rests on the applicant to demonstrate this element of the case  in respect of Ms Barros  on the balance of probabilities  see Briginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR   as explained in Neat Holdings Pty Ltd v Karajan Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         ALR        Therefore  in relation to Ms Barros  I place her in the same category as the other employees listed in Column   of the table   OPERATION OF SECTION       I now turn to the main issue in this proceeding  the operation of s   of the Act  which is in the following terms  Payments not to be made or accepted in relation to periods of industrial action         This section applies if an employee engaged  or engages  in industrial action  whether or not protected action  in relation to an employer on a day     The employer must not make a payment to an employee in relation to             a  if the total duration of the industrial action on that day is less than   hours    hours of that day  or   b  otherwise  the total duration of the industrial action on that day            If           a  the industrial action is during a shift  or other period of work  and   b  the shift  or other period of work  occurs partly on   day and partly on the next day            then  for the purposes of this section  the shift is taken to be a day and the remaining parts of the days are taken not to be part of that day     For the purposes of subsection   overtime is taken not to be a separate shift     An employee must not accept a payment from an employer if the employer would contravene subsection   by making the payment                    The definition of industrial action is found in s   of the Act  It provides the following  Meaning of industrial action       For the purposes of this Act  industrial action means any action of the following kinds             a  the performance of work by an employee in a manner different from that in which it is customarily performed  or the adoption of a practice in relation to work by an employee  the result of which is a restriction or limitation on  or a delay in  the performance of the work   b  a ban  limitation or restriction on the performance of work by an employee or on the acceptance of or offering for work by an employee   c  a failure or refusal by employees to attend for work or a failure or refusal to perform any work at all by employees who attend for work   d  the lockout of employees from their employment by the employer of the employees  but does not include the following   e  action by employees that is authorised or agreed to by the employer of the employees   f  action by an employer that is authorised or agreed to by or on behalf of employees of the employer             g  action by an employee if           i  the action was based on a reasonable concern by the employee about an imminent risk to his or her health or safety  and   ii  the employee did not unreasonably fail to comply with a direction of his or her employer to perform other available work  whether at the same or another workplace  that was safe and appropriate for the employee to perform      For the purposes of this Act         a  conduct is capable of constituting industrial action even if the conduct relates to part only of the duties that employees are required to perform in the course of their employment  and   b  a reference to industrial action includes a reference to a course of conduct consisting of a series of industrial actions        It is unnecessary here to consider the definition of industrial action in s   of the Act in much detail  It is uncontested between the parties that the employees engaged in industrial action within the meaning of s  b  of the Act for the purposes of s    It is well accepted that part performance of work  or performance of work other than as directed  amounts to industrial action  An ongoing ban on the operation of a certain machine  or on performing certain tasks  while otherwise completing a full day s work  is industrial action  A lock out from  or a ban on  performing overtime  where overtime is not required or expected under a contract of employment may constitute industrial action      In Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union v Master Builders  Association of Victoria   FCA         FCR     Goldberg J considered the meaning of the expression  preventing employees from performing work  for the purposes of the then s  ML   His Honour was addressing the question of whether preventing employees from performing overtime work that they did not have a right to perform under their contracts of employment could constitute a lock out under that provision  His Honour said at    at     The expression  preventing  in the context of s  ML  involves the doing of an act which has the consequence that employees cannot perform work which  if performed  would be work performed under their contracts of employment  The concept of  preventing  in the context of s  ML  is not limited to a situation of putting up a barrier or bar to something which is going to happen in the absence of some supervening event stopping it  it also covers a situation where something is stopped in circumstances where if it was allowed or granted it would occur in a particular way    The same analysis can be applied in the circumstance here  where these employees imposed a ban on the performance of overtime even where there was no contractual obligation or right to perform it  Using the words of s  b  of the Act  it was a ban  on the acceptance of or offering for work       The main dispute in this proceeding between the parties was whether the overtime ban constituted ongoing industrial action commencing at the time specified in the notice advising of overtime bans  being the morning of   August   and continuing until the ban was removed  after   August   or whether there were a series of industrial actions in relation to overtime separated by days of ordinary work     As I have indicated  Heinemann contended that it was prohibited by the operation of s   of the Act from paying the employees any wages for any of the days         and   August    It said that the notice of intention to take protected action  which included the overtime bans  served on Heinemann by the Union was in terms that imposed an ongoing ban on performing overtime  commencing on Tuesday    August   and continuing for   months or until agreement was reached on the terms of a new Union collective agreement  Heinemann also contended that the company enquired with the employees whether they intended to implement the ban and the employees advised Heinemann of their intention to do so  Heinemann contended that the ban was clearly in place  and was not lifted and reapplied on a daily basis and as such it constituted ongoing industrial action      The applicant contended that the industrial action implemented by the employees was a series of bans either from     pm each day until the start of the shift the following day  or for a two hour period between     pm and     pm each day being the time that an ordinary overtime shift takes place at the factory      In resolving the main dispute between the parties  it is important to understand and appreciate the purpose of s    There has been no judicial consideration of the legislative purpose of s   although some consideration has been given to its predecessor  s  AA of the pre reform Act  In Independent Education Union of Australia v Canonical Administrators     FCR     Ryan J discussed the policy behind s  AA of the pre reform Act  which operated similarly to s   to prohibit the payment of  strike pay   His Honour said at     I consider that s  AA in the context of Pt VIIIA of the WR Act evinces a policy that collective bargaining should occur in an environment where employer and employee are to appreciate and accept the detrimental consequences for themselves of industrial action used as part of the negotiating armoury  For the employee those consequences are normally loss of remuneration in respect of the period of the industrial action and for the employer they are the loss of production attendant on a lockout  Consistently with that policy  s  AA is framed to ensure that the loss of remuneration is not recouped after the bargaining is over and necessarily applies to protected action    Justice Lander also commented on the legislative purpose of s  AA of the pre reform Act in Ponzio v B   P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR    His Honour said at      at          The policy of the Act is to discourage industrial action as it is defined in s   of the Act  The purpose of Pt VIIIA of the Act  in which these provisions are contained  is to prevent an employer making a payment to the employer s employee in relation to any period during which the employee engages in industrial action  It is the intention of the Act to discourage employers and employees agreeing to the employer paying employees for that period of industrial action engaged in by the employee  To that end  s  AA makes it a contravention for an employer to make a payment to an employee who has in relation to a period during which the employee engaged or engages in industrial action and at the same time makes it a contravention for the employee to accept a payment from an employer if by doing so the employer will contravene subs   by making that payment  The policy of the Act is that if an employee engages in industrial action then it must be at the employee s own expense  The purpose of s  AB is to discourage unions and their officers from making claims for a payment or engaging in or threatening to engage in or organising industrial action for the purpose of coercing the employer to make a payment to an employee during a period of industrial action  That section has as its added purpose a protection to the employer in the event that a union or its members engage in that further industrial action     Industrial action is discouraged by putting the cost of that industrial action upon the employee rather than the employer  No doubt it is thought that an employee will be less likely to take industrial action if the employee knows that it is a contravention for both the employer and the employee if the employer makes a payment for the period of industrial action    Both Ryan and Lander JJ s considerations of the policy standing behind s  AA suggest that the purpose of that provision was to make employees carry the expense of any industrial action engaged in by them  Neither Ryan or Lander JJ considered that the provision was intended to operate more broadly to punish the parties for engaging in protected industrial action beyond shouldering the burden of the actual economic loss resulting from the action     Section   is in different terms to s  AA  although basically the same purpose behind the provision is as set out by Ryan and Lander JJ in their consideration of its predecessor      However  it is important to observe that s   sets out a calculation to assess how many hours  pay an employer must withhold from an employee who engages in industrial action on a day  depending on whether the employee engages in industrial action for a period less than four hours or four hours or more  The effect of the subsection is that an employee who engages in industrial action for any period less than four hours in a day  even if it is a period of five or ten minutes  must have four hours of pay withheld  Notably  an employee who engages in industrial action for four hours or more in a day must not be paid in relation to the period of industrial action on that day  but may be paid in relation to hours worked  For example  an employee who takes industrial action for five hours in a day but works the other     hours of an ordinary day must not be paid in relation to   hours of the day but is entitled to payment in relation to     hours     It seems one purpose of the operation of s   is to deter industrial action for minor grievances  An employee will seriously consider stopping work for just five minutes if the consequence is losing a half day s pay  On the other hand  I do not consider the provision to be punitive  If it were  the provision would operate to deduct a full day s pay from an employee who engages in four hours or more industrial action on a day  Rather the intention seems to be to ensure that industrial action is not taken lightly and that the employee who engages in industrial action bears the economic consequences of that industrial action     The Court must construe the words of s   in context  Part of the context of s   is that there is a right to take protected action  Another part of the context is that  because of other provisions of the Act  there is a right ordinarily to be paid for the work undertaken  Another part of the context is that the Act is trying to ensure that either

are taken not to be part of that day     For the purposes of subsection   overtime is taken not to be a separate shift     An employee must not accept a payment from an employer if the employer would contravene subsection   by making the payment                    The definition of industrial action is found in s   of the Act  It provides the following  Meaning of industrial action       For the purposes of this Act  industrial action means any action of the following kinds             a  the performance of work by an employee in a manner different from that in which it is customarily performed  or the adoption of a practice in relation to work by an employee  the result of which is a restriction or limitation on  or a delay in  the performance of the work   b  a ban  limitation or restriction on the performance of work by an employee or on the acceptance of or offering for work by an employee   c  a failure or refusal by employees to attend for work or a failure or refusal to perform any work at all by employees who attend for work   d  the lockout of employees from their employment by the employer of the employees  but does not include the following   e  action by employees that is authorised or agreed to by the employer of the employees   f  action by an employer that is authorised or agreed to by or on behalf of employees of the employer             g  action by an employee if           i  the action was based on a reasonable concern by the employee about an imminent risk to his or her health or safety  and   ii  the employee did not unreasonably fail to comply with a direction of his or her employer to perform other available work  whether at the same or another workplace  that was safe and appropriate for the employee to perform      For the purposes of this Act         a  conduct is capable of constituting industrial action even if the conduct relates to part only of the duties that employees are required to perform in the course of their employment  and   b  a reference to industrial action includes a reference to a course of conduct consisting of a series of industrial actions        It is unnecessary here to consider the definition of industrial action in s   of the Act in much detail  It is uncontested between the parties that the employees engaged in industrial action within the meaning of s  b  of the Act for the purposes of s    It is well accepted that part performance of work  or performance of work other than as directed  amounts to industrial action  An ongoing ban on the operation of a certain machine  or on performing certain tasks  while otherwise completing a full day s work  is industrial action  A lock out from  or a ban on  performing overtime  where overtime is not required or expected under a contract of employment may constitute industrial action      In Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union v Master Builders  Association of Victoria   FCA         FCR     Goldberg J considered the meaning of the expression  preventing employees from performing work  for the purposes of the then s  ML   His Honour was addressing the question of whether preventing employees from performing overtime work that they did not have a right to perform under their contracts of employment could constitute a lock out under that provision  His Honour said at    at     The expression  preventing  in the context of s  ML  involves the doing of an act which has the consequence that employees cannot perform work which  if performed  would be work performed under their contracts of employment  The concept of  preventing  in the context of s  ML  is not limited to a situation of putting up a barrier or bar to something which is going to happen in the absence of some supervening event stopping it  it also covers a situation where something is stopped in circumstances where if it was allowed or granted it would occur in a particular way    The same analysis can be applied in the circumstance here  where these employees imposed a ban on the performance of overtime even where there was no contractual obligation or right to perform it  Using the words of s  b  of the Act  it was a ban  on the acceptance of or offering for work       The main dispute in this proceeding between the parties was whether the overtime ban constituted ongoing industrial action commencing at the time specified in the notice advising of overtime bans  being the morning of   August   and continuing until the ban was removed  after   August   or whether there were a series of industrial actions in relation to overtime separated by days of ordinary work     As I have indicated  Heinemann contended that it was prohibited by the operation of s   of the Act from paying the employees any wages for any of the days         and   August    It said that the notice of intention to take protected action  which included the overtime bans  served on Heinemann by the Union was in terms that imposed an ongoing ban on performing overtime  commencing on Tuesday    August   and continuing for   months or until agreement was reached on the terms of a new Union collective agreement  Heinemann also contended that the company enquired with the employees whether they intended to implement the ban and the employees advised Heinemann of their intention to do so  Heinemann contended that the ban was clearly in place  and was not lifted and reapplied on a daily basis and as such it constituted ongoing industrial action      The applicant contended that the industrial action implemented by the employees was a series of bans either from     pm each day until the start of the shift the following day  or for a two hour period between     pm and     pm each day being the time that an ordinary overtime shift takes place at the factory      In resolving the main dispute between the parties  it is important to understand and appreciate the purpose of s    There has been no judicial consideration of the legislative purpose of s   although some consideration has been given to its predecessor  s  AA of the pre reform Act  In Independent Education Union of Australia v Canonical Administrators     FCR     Ryan J discussed the policy behind s  AA of the pre reform Act  which operated similarly to s   to prohibit the payment of  strike pay   His Honour said at     I consider that s  AA in the context of Pt VIIIA of the WR Act evinces a policy that collective bargaining should occur in an environment where employer and employee are to appreciate and accept the detrimental consequences for themselves of industrial action used as part of the negotiating armoury  For the employee those consequences are normally loss of remuneration in respect of the period of the industrial action and for the employer they are the loss of production attendant on a lockout  Consistently with that policy  s  AA is framed to ensure that the loss of remuneration is not recouped after the bargaining is over and necessarily applies to protected action    Justice Lander also commented on the legislative purpose of s  AA of the pre reform Act in Ponzio v B   P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR    His Honour said at      at          The policy of the Act is to discourage industrial action as it is defined in s   of the Act  The purpose of Pt VIIIA of the Act  in which these provisions are contained  is to prevent an employer making a payment to the employer s employee in relation to any period during which the employee engages in industrial action  It is the intention of the Act to discourage employers and employees agreeing to the employer paying employees for that period of industrial action engaged in by the employee  To that end  s  AA makes it a contravention for an employer to make a payment to an employee who has in relation to a period during which the employee engaged or engages in industrial action and at the same time makes it a contravention for the employee to accept a payment from an employer if by doing so the employer will contravene subs   by making that payment  The policy of the Act is that if an employee engages in industrial action then it must be at the employee s own expense  The purpose of s  AB is to discourage unions and their officers from making claims for a payment or engaging in or threatening to engage in or organising industrial action for the purpose of coercing the employer to make a payment to an employee during a period of industrial action  That section has as its added purpose a protection to the employer in the event that a union or its members engage in that further industrial action     Industrial action is discouraged by putting the cost of that industrial action upon the employee rather than the employer  No doubt it is thought that an employee will be less likely to take industrial action if the employee knows that it is a contravention for both the employer and the employee if the employer makes a payment for the period of industrial action    Both Ryan and Lander JJ s considerations of the policy standing behind s  AA suggest that the purpose of that provision was to make employees carry the expense of any industrial action engaged in by them  Neither Ryan or Lander JJ considered that the provision was intended to operate more broadly to punish the parties for engaging in protected industrial action beyond shouldering the burden of the actual economic loss resulting from the action     Section   is in different terms to s  AA  although basically the same purpose behind the provision is as set out by Ryan and Lander JJ in their consideration of its predecessor      However  it is important to observe that s   sets out a calculation to assess how many hours  pay an employer must withhold from an employee who engages in industrial action on a day  depending on whether the employee engages in industrial action for a period less than four hours or four hours or more  The effect of the subsection is that an employee who engages in industrial action for any period less than four hours in a day  even if it is a period of five or ten minutes  must have four hours of pay withheld  Notably  an employee who engages in industrial action for four hours or more in a day must not be paid in relation to the period of industrial action on that day  but may be paid in relation to hours worked  For example  an employee who takes industrial action for five hours in a day but works the other     hours of an ordinary day must not be paid in relation to   hours of the day but is entitled to payment in relation to     hours     It seems one purpose of the operation of s   is to deter industrial action for minor grievances  An employee will seriously consider stopping work for just five minutes if the consequence is losing a half day s pay  On the other hand  I do not consider the provision to be punitive  If it were  the provision would operate to deduct a full day s pay from an employee who engages in four hours or more industrial action on a day  Rather the intention seems to be to ensure that industrial action is not taken lightly and that the employee who engages in industrial action bears the economic consequences of that industrial action     The Court must construe the words of s   in context  Part of the context of s   is that there is a right to take protected action  Another part of the context is that  because of other provisions of the Act  there is a right ordinarily to be paid for the work undertaken  Another part of the context is that the Act is trying to ensure that either employer or employee bears the financial consequence of loss of production  in the case of a lock out  the employer  in the case of a strike  the employee followedPacific Carriers Limited v BNP Paribas     CLR   I have ignored the expressions of subjective intention of the employees  although such were in evidence before me  Obviously  the subjective intentions of any party should not be taken into account when construing an agreement  see eg  DTR Nominees Pty Ltd v Mona Homes Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   and Pacific Carriers Limited v BNP Paribas     CLR          Of course  the objective background which I may consider does include the purposes and assumptions shared by the parties  see Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of New South Wales   HCA         CLR        It is the fact of their concurrence by the parties which converts what would otherwise be  subjective intention  into objective elements of an agreement s context  Relevantly  in this proceeding  as I will return to later  I take into account Heinemann s position made known to the Union and the employees that it could not make any payment by reason of s   of the Act  and the fact that the issue of the unpaid wages in respect of the overtime ban was not up for discussion or consideration by Heinemann at the time of entering each sign on bonus agreement citedPoletti v Ecob  No       IR   In Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Limited v Financial Services Union of Australia     IR   at   the Full Court  Black CJ  Wilcox and von Doussa JJ  considered the circumstances in which a payment under contract could discharge an obligation under an award  Their Honours quoted the Full Court in Poletti v Ecob  No       IR   at    at         In Poletti v Ecob  at       the Full Court made this comment           It is to be noted that there are two separate situations dealt with in the passage from the judgment of Sheldon J which has been quoted and in the reasoning of the Commission in Pacific Publications   The first situation is that in which the parties to a contract of employment have agreed that a sum or sums of money will be paid and received for specific purposes  over and above or extraneous to award entitlements  In that situation  the contract between the parties prevents the employer afterwards claiming that payments made pursuant to the contractual obligation can be relied on in satisfaction of award entitlements arising outside the agreed purpose of the payments  The second situation is that in which there are outstanding award entitlements  and a sum of money is paid by the employer to the employee  If that sum is designated by the employer as being for a purpose other than the satisfaction of the award entitlements  the employer cannot afterwards claim to have satisfied the award entitlements by means of the payment  The former situation is a question of contract  The latter situation is an application of the common law rules governing payments by a debtor to a creditor  In the absence of a contractual obligation to pay and apply moneys to a particular obligation  where a debtor has more than one obligation to a creditor  it is open to the debtor  either before or at the time of making a payment  to appropriate it to a particular obligation  If no such appropriation is made  then the creditor may apply the payment to whichever obligation or obligations he or she wishes  see Halsbury s Laws of England    th ed  vol   pars   and    citedPonzio v B   P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html   There were employees at the factory as at August   and during the period of the overtime bans who did not engage in the overtime ban  but nevertheless received the sign on bonus  These included A Rico  F Bacosa  LJ Ferdinads  TL Pui  EF Gonzales  VD Wijeyeratne  SS Chan  SH Chan  M Yan  A Loh  VN

Manuse  O Grah      FURTHER FACTS     It is necessary to refer to some further facts     In respect of how overtime was worked at the factory  there were differences in the practices of different sections of the factory  Generally  overtime shifts lasted for approximately two hours  from     pm to     pm  and between one and   of the factory employees might work on any given evening  However  some sections regularly worked overtime and other sections worked overtime infrequently  The assembly workers generally worked minimal overtime  whilst the qualified fitters were called on frequently to perform overtime because of their specialised skills  It was also clear from the evidence of both Mr Ross  the General Manager of Heinemann  and Mr Aspinall  a Factory Manager of Heinemann  as well as from the employees  that there was not a practice of relying on overtime rosters  Instead  notice of overtime was commonly given to employees either on the day before or on the day that overtime was required  Employees then had an opportunity to accept or decline the extra hours  The evidence was that there was never any difficulty in finding employees to perform the additional work and that employees ordinarily accepted the work  It is also clear that employees could and did decline overtime work without ascribing any cause or reason     There was no evidence of Heinemann s overtime requirements on the days in question  There was no evidence of whether any employees actually performed overtime that week  Heinemann did not have overtime records for         and   August    The handwritten notations on the questionnaires show which employees of those interviewed were and were not available for overtime over the life of the overtime ban  and a reason for not working overtime  However  they do not indicate whether Heinemann required overtime on any evening  and if so  how much overtime was required  whether requests were made of employees to perform overtime  or whether any employee performed any requested overtime on any evening      Nevertheless  it was uncontested that the employees in Column   of the table engaged in the ban on overtime on the days in question  and that they were not paid wages referrable to these days  In addition  Heinemann also failed to pay Ms Maria Barros for the days in question on the basis that she too was implementing the ban on overtime  The applicant submits that Ms Barros was not in fact implementing the ban and should have been paid in full for those days irrespective of the operation of s      MS BARROS     It is convenient to first consider the position of Ms Barros  Ms Barros failed to answer any questions asked of her in the questionnaire  She was initially questioned by her manager  Mr Aspinall  and later by Mr Ross  Her questionnaire was annotated simply   Will not answer any questions  Do not understand   Mr Ross wrote at the end of Ms Barros  questionnaire that he had explained to Ms Barros the position in detail  He was referring to informing those employees  who had confirmed that they were enforcing the ban that they would not be paid for the duration of the overtime ban or any industrial action  Mr Ross told the Court that he believed Ms Barros understood his explanation  Ms Barros told the Court that she did not understand  She said her failure to answer was because she did not know what overtime Mr Aspinall and Mr Ross were referring to  as she rarely performed overtime  and she did not want to answer before speaking with her union representative      Ms Barros agreed that she participated in the strike of   August   and participated in the six week strike which commenced on   August    Heinemann submitted that Ms Barros  participation in the strikes goes some way to demonstrate that she also participated in the ban on overtime  This does not necessarily follow  although it is a factor to consider in the balance  as to the likelihood of the happening of events  Heinemann also contended that Ms Barros  evidence was unreliable because of the discrepancy in her affidavit evidence and the documentary evidence showing the amount of overtime she had in fact worked previously      My own assessment of the evidence is this  Ms Barros cannot understand English very well  she deposed to this  and it was apparent from her cross examination  She said she was very confused about the questions asked of her by Mr Aspinall and Mr Ross  and she appeared confused under cross examination both as to what was being asked of her by Counsel and as to the overtime position  In my view  despite the belief of Mr Ross  she was confused  Ms Barros had little understanding of the matters being asked of her by Counsel  and I consider had little understanding of the matters put to her by Mr Aspinall and Mr Ross at the time of the questionnaire     While I consider that Ms Barros was endeavouring to tell the truth  her recollection as to when her overtime was in fact taken was faulty  She did indicate that she would go to the Union for advice  which had implemented overtime bans  She did participate in the strike of   August   and the six week strike commencing on   August    In my view  it is more than likely that she did engage in the overtime bans by following the Union s approach      In any event  in view of Ms Barros  obvious confusion  I cannot be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that it has been demonstrated by the applicant that Ms Barros was entitled to be paid in full irrespective of the operation of s    The onus rests on the applicant to demonstrate this element of the case  in respect of Ms Barros  on the balance of probabilities  see Briginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR   as explained in Neat Holdings Pty Ltd v Karajan Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         ALR        Therefore  in relation to Ms Barros  I place her in the same category as the other employees listed in Column   of the table   OPERATION OF SECTION       I now turn to the main issue in this proceeding  the operation of s   of the Act  which is in the following terms  Payments not to be made or accepted in relation to periods of industrial action         This section applies if an employee engaged  or engages  in industrial action  whether or not protected action  in relation to an employer on a day     The employer must not make a payment to an employee in relation to             a  if the total duration of the industrial action on that day is less than   hours    hours of that day  or   b  otherwise  the total duration of the industrial action on that day            If           a  the industrial action is during a shift  or other period of work  and   b  the shift  or other period of work  occurs partly on   day and partly on the next day            then  for the purposes of this section  the shift is taken to be a day and the remaining parts of the days are taken not to be part of that day     For the purposes of subsection   overtime is taken not to be a separate shift     An employee must not accept a payment from an employer if the employer would contravene subsection   by making the payment                    The definition of industrial action is found in s   of the Act  It provides the following  Meaning of industrial action       For the purposes of this Act  industrial action means any action of the following kinds             a  the performance of work by an employee in a manner different from that in which it is customarily performed  or the adoption of a practice in relation to work by an employee  the result of which is a restriction or limitation on  or a delay in  the performance of the work   b  a ban  limitation or restriction on the performance of work by an employee or on the acceptance of or offering for work by an employee   c  a failure or refusal by employees to attend for work or a failure or refusal to perform any work at all by employees who attend for work   d  the lockout of employees from their employment by the employer of the employees  but does not include the following   e  action by employees that is authorised or agreed to by the employer of the employees   f  action by an employer that is authorised or agreed to by or on behalf of employees of the employer             g  action by an employee if           i  the action was based on a reasonable concern by the employee about an imminent risk to his or her health or safety  and   ii  the employee did not unreasonably fail to comply with a direction of his or her employer to perform other available work  whether at the same or another workplace  that was safe and appropriate for the employee to perform      For the purposes of this Act         a  conduct is capable of constituting industrial action even if the conduct relates to part only of the duties that employees are required to perform in the course of their employment  and   b  a reference to industrial action includes a reference to a course of conduct consisting of a series of industrial actions        It is unnecessary here to consider the definition of industrial action in s   of the Act in much detail  It is uncontested between the parties that the employees engaged in industrial action within the meaning of s  b  of the Act for the purposes of s    It is well accepted that part performance of work  or performance of work other than as directed  amounts to industrial action  An ongoing ban on the operation of a certain machine  or on performing certain tasks  while otherwise completing a full day s work  is industrial action  A lock out from  or a ban on  performing overtime  where overtime is not required or expected under a contract of employment may constitute industrial action      In Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union v Master Builders  Association of Victoria   FCA         FCR     Goldberg J considered the meaning of the expression  preventing employees from performing work  for the purposes of the then s  ML   His Honour was addressing the question of whether preventing employees from performing overtime work that they did not have a right to perform under their contracts of employment could constitute a lock out under that provision  His Honour said at    at     The expression  preventing  in the context of s  ML  involves the doing of an act which has the consequence that employees cannot perform work which  if performed  would be work performed under their contracts of employment  The concept of  preventing  in the context of s  ML  is not limited to a situation of putting up a barrier or bar to something which is going to happen in the absence of some supervening event stopping it  it also covers a situation where something is stopped in circumstances where if it was allowed or granted it would occur in a particular way    The same analysis can be applied in the circumstance here  where these employees imposed a ban on the performance of overtime even where there was no contractual obligation or right to perform it  Using the words of s  b  of the Act  it was a ban  on the acceptance of or offering for work       The main dispute in this proceeding between the parties was whether the overtime ban constituted ongoing industrial action commencing at the time specified in the notice advising of overtime bans  being the morning of   August   and continuing until the ban was removed  after   August   or whether there were a series of industrial actions in relation to overtime separated by days of ordinary work     As I have indicated  Heinemann contended that it was prohibited by the operation of s   of the Act from paying the employees any wages for any of the days         and   August    It said that the notice of intention to take protected action  which included the overtime bans  served on Heinemann by the Union was in terms that imposed an ongoing ban on performing overtime  commencing on Tuesday    August   and continuing for   months or until agreement was reached on the terms of a new Union collective agreement  Heinemann also contended that the company enquired with the employees whether they intended to implement the ban and the employees advised Heinemann of their intention to do so  Heinemann contended that the ban was clearly in place  and was not lifted and reapplied on a daily basis and as such it constituted ongoing industrial action      The applicant contended that the industrial action implemented by the employees was a series of bans either from     pm each day until the start of the shift the following day  or for a two hour period between     pm and     pm each day being the time that an ordinary overtime shift takes place at the factory      In resolving the main dispute between the parties  it is important to understand and appreciate the purpose of s    There has been no judicial consideration of the legislative purpose of s   although some consideration has been given to its predecessor  s  AA of the pre reform Act  In Independent Education Union of Australia v Canonical Administrators     FCR     Ryan J discussed the policy behind s  AA of the pre reform Act  which operated similarly to s   to prohibit the payment of  strike pay   His Honour said at     I consider that s  AA in the context of Pt VIIIA of the WR Act evinces a policy that collective bargaining should occur in an environment where employer and employee are to appreciate and accept the detrimental consequences for themselves of industrial action used as part of the negotiating armoury  For the employee those consequences are normally loss of remuneration in respect of the period of the industrial action and for the employer they are the loss of production attendant on a lockout  Consistently with that policy  s  AA is framed to ensure that the loss of remuneration is not recouped after the bargaining is over and necessarily applies to protected action    Justice Lander also commented on the legislative purpose of s  AA of the pre reform Act in Ponzio v B   P Caelli Constructions Pty Ltd   FCAFC         FCR    His Honour said at      at          The policy of the Act is to discourage industrial action as it is defined in s   of the Act  The purpose of Pt VIIIA of the Act  in which these provisions are contained  is to prevent an employer making a payment to the employer s employee in relation to any period during which the employee engages in industrial action  It is the intention of the Act to discourage employers and employees agreeing to the employer paying employees for that period of industrial action engaged in by the employee  To that end  s  AA makes it a contravention for an employer to make a payment to an employee who has in relation to a period during which the employee engaged or engages in industrial action and at the same time makes it a contravention for the employee to accept a payment from an employer if by doing so the employer will contravene subs   by making that payment  The policy of the Act is that if an employee engages in industrial action then it must be at the employee s own expense  The purpose of s  AB is to discourage unions and their officers from making claims for a payment or engaging in or threatening to engage in or organising industrial action for the purpose of coercing the employer to make a payment to an employee during a period of industrial action  That section has as its added purpose a protection to the employer in the event that a union or its members engage in that further industrial action     Industrial action is discouraged by putting the cost of that industrial action upon the employee rather than the employer  No doubt it is thought that an employee will be less likely to take industrial action if the employee knows that it is a contravention for both the employer and the employee if the employer makes a payment for the period of industrial action    Both Ryan and Lander JJ s considerations of the policy standing behind s  AA suggest that the purpose of that provision was to make employees carry the expense of any industrial action engaged in by them  Neither Ryan or Lander JJ considered that the provision was intended to operate more broadly to punish the parties for engaging in protected industrial action beyond shouldering the burden of the actual economic loss resulting from the action     Section   is in different terms to s  AA  although basically the same purpose behind the provision is as set out by Ryan and Lander JJ in their consideration of its predecessor      However  it is important to observe that s   sets out a calculation to assess how many hours  pay an employer must withhold from an employee who engages in industrial action on a day  depending on whether the employee engages in industrial action for a period less than four hours or four hours or more  The effect of the subsection is that an employee who engages in industrial action for any period less than four hours in a day  even if it is a period of five or ten minutes  must have four hours of pay withheld  Notably  an employee who engages in industrial action for four hours or more in a day must not be paid in relation to the period of industrial action on that day  but may be paid in relation to hours worked  For example  an employee who takes industrial action for five hours in a day but works the other     hours of an ordinary day must not be paid in relation to   hours of the day but is entitled to payment in relation to     hours     It seems one purpose of the operation of s   is to deter industrial action for minor grievances  An employee will seriously consider stopping work for just five minutes if the consequence is losing a half day s pay  On the other hand  I do not consider the provision to be punitive  If it were  the provision would operate to deduct a full day s pay from an employee who engages in four hours or more industrial action on a day  Rather the intention seems to be to ensure that industrial action is not taken lightly and that the employee who engages in industrial action bears the economic consequences of that industrial action     The Court must construe the words of s   in context  Part of the context of s   is that there is a right to take protected action  Another part of the context is that  because of other provisions of the Act  there is a right ordinarily to be paid for the work undertaken  Another part of the context is that the Act is trying to ensure that either employer or employee bears the financial consequence of loss of production  in the case of a lock out  the employer  in the case of a strike  the employee   Some assistance can be derived in determining the duration of the industrial action in the present case by comments by Jessup J in Ponzio   FCAFC       FCR   of how to define  period  in the context of s  AA  at      at          Whether particular industrial action occurs during a single period  or during separate periods  will also be a question of fact  For my own part  I do not regard it as self evident that every day upon which industrial action occurs should be regarded as a separate  period   In the present case  for example  I consider that an employee who stopped work on   August   and did not resume work until     am on   August   should be regarded as having engaged in industrial action during one period only  If that period were broken by a period during which the employee performed work normally  there would then have been two periods of industrial action   It is important to note that Jessup J s comments were made in relation to s  AA which did not require looking at industrial action  on a day   Section  AA included the words  in relation to a period in which   An important feature of s   and the most salient distinction between s   and its predecessor s  AA  is the focus on the industrial action  on a day  and to calculate the duration of industrial action on a day by day basis  However  his Honour makes clear that the industrial action is not necessarily considered a continuing period of industrial action if it is broken by a period of ordinary work   As I have said  the operation of s   has the consequence that employees are to bear the economic loss of their industrial action  In a case where the employees have contributed the benefit of a full day s work to their employer  it seems contrary to the intention of the provision to punish employees beyond the calculation allowed for in the provision   It was agreed that on each of         and   August   the employees imposed a ban on overtime  On the facts of the case before me  I am satisfied that the ban constituted two hours of industrial action on each of those days citedTextile  Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Givoni Pty Ltd     IR   It was accepted that one cannot contract out of award provisions  see Josephson v Walker     CLR   at   Byrne v Australian Airlines Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   Textile  Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Givoni Pty Ltd     IR   at    However  the parties agreed that there was  in theory  no barrier to compromising or satisfying a claim arising under the Act for underpayment of wages  The compromise or settlement of a claim in accord and satisfaction was distinguishable from a contracting out scenario where an employer seeks to avoid award obligations by entering into an employment agreement that strips away award rights consideredThe Workers  Compensation Board of Queensland v Technical Products Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The application of the expression  in respect of  was discussed by the High Court in The Workers  Compensation Board of Queensland v Technical Products Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR    per Deane  Dawson and Toohey JJ  at     Undoubtedly the words  in respect of  have a wide meaning  although it is going somewhat too far to say  as did Mann CJ in Trustees Executors   Agency Co Ltd v Reilly   VLR   at   that  they have the widest possible meaning of any expression intended to convey some connection or relation between the two subject matters to which the words refer   The phrase gathers meaning from the context in which it appears and it is that context which will determine the matters to which it extends   The wage dispute in respect of the overtime ban could be viewed as in someway connected to the industrial action  The overtime ban was part of the industrial action  as shown by the notice given by the Union  The employees actually engaged this form of industrial action and  as a consequence of that course of conduct  Heinemann withheld all pay for the period   However  the context in which the release appears in the sign on bonus agreement  and the context of the agreement with the Union  indicates that the basis of the payment was not intended to extend to the unpaid wages in respect of the five days in August    The employees  claim arising from Heinemann s failure to pay the employees in full for the period of industrial action was essentially only a claim for non payment of wages  While the non payment of employees occurred during the period of industrial action  this does not mean the employees  claim was  in respect of  any industrial action as contemplated by the ambit of the sign on bonus agreement and the releases contained therein
