express words make clear  s  b  of the Act is concerned with both actual and  ostensible or apparent authority  see Freeman   Lockyer  a firm  v Buckhurst Park Properties  Mangal  Ltd     QB   at     Consistent with that view of s  b  of the Act   the ACCC contends that Telstra is liable on two grounds  first  that each of the Events was published by one of Telstra s dealers and secondly  by reason of the prominence of the Telstra branding in each of the Events   A copy of a dealership agreement between Telstra Corporation Ltd and De Graaff Holdings Pty Ltd incorporating licence terms and mobile service terms  the dealership agreement  was adduced into evidence as representative of the contractual arrangements between Telstra and its dealers  The terms of the dealership agreement are  unsurprisingly  confidential  For that reason  I do not propose to set out the terms of the agreement in any detail followedcitedGillette Australia Pty Ltd v Energizer Australia Pty Ltd     ALR   I have carefully reviewed each Event several times and have sought to assess the likely effect of each Event on mobile phone users  including potential mobile phone users  In undertaking that task I have been conscious of the fact that a detailed inspection of the transcript of the television and radio advertisements must give a misleading impression of what is conveyed  However  in reviewing each Event I also had at the forefront the following caution from Lindgren J in Gillette Australia Pty Ltd v Energizer Australia Pty Ltd     ALR   at   regarding television advertising             A part from the difference between a one off viewing and repeated viewings  the circumstances in which a judge attends to a television commercial for the purposes of a case are not those in which members of the public do so  First  members of the public watch a commercial after and before viewing other things  rather than in isolation  Second  unlike the judge  they do not carefully view the commercial with a special interest in noting and memorising its features  Third  they view the commercial  not in the calm of chambers  but against a background of distractions  such as domestic activity  or simply a preoccupation with other more interesting or pressing concerns  Fourth  usually they do not know in advance that the commercial is about to commence   Similar caution must be adopted when reviewing the other  non television Events   With that caution in mind  I shall now set out a more detailed description of each of the   Events citedJohnson   Johnson Pacific Pty Ltd v
