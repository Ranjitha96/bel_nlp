Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The discretion conferred by s  F is conferred in general terms and does not specify any criteria to be satisfied  It must  however  be a discretion exercised in a manner which promotes the objects of the Act  including the protection of the interests of policy holders in ways consistent with   the continued development of a viable  competitive and innovative insurance industry    A   critical consideration   is   whether affected policyholders will be detrimentally affected by the implementation of the scheme   PMI Indemnity Limited  No     FCA   at   per Lindgren J   Section   of the   Act  it should further be noted  provides that the Authority may also determine   prudential standards   that must be complied with  Of immediate relevance to the present proceedings are three such standards  namely   i  Prudential Standard GPS      which deals with   Capital Adequacy   and aims to ensure that the security of policy holder obligations of all insurers is established at an appropriate level by requiring that each general insurer maintain at least a minimum amount of capital   ii  Prudential Standard GPS      which deals with audit and actuarial reporting and outlines the roles and responsibilities of a general insurer s Approved Actuary  and   iii  Prudential Standard GPS      which deals with the transfer and amalgamation of the insurance business of a general insurer    Also of relevance is   iv  A   Prudential Practice Guide  Draft    which deals with   Capital Adequacy   and   Capital Management     The   Summary of the Scheme   in the present proceedings was approved by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and sets out the effect of the Scheme as follows  Summary of scheme The following is a summary of the scheme   a  All of the rights  liabilities and obligations of BIC under policies issued or underwritten by BIC in the conduct of BIC s Australian insurance business will be

the benefit of BIC will be assigned to A G    c  Except for A G being substituted for BIC as insurer  the transfer will not result in any change to policy benefits or policy terms and conditions under policies issued or underwritten by BIC    d  The rights  benefits  obligations and liabilities of holders of policies issued by BIC in Australia will be the same as if those policies had been issued or underwritten by A G instead of BIC  Claims under such policies are to be made to A G  instead of BIC    e  BIC will bear the costs and expenses relating to the transfer and the scheme    f  The transfer will take effect on the first business day after the date on which the scheme is confirmed by the Court followedRe Insurance Australia Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA
