Rivera v The Commonwealth of Australia   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredCabal v Secretary  Department of Justice  Victoria      ALR   In Cabal v Secretary  Department of Justice  Victoria      ALR   Gray J considered a claim similar to Mr Rivera s concerning treatment and the asserted right by persons awaiting extradition not to be held in the same manner as convicted persons  at      There it was argued that the Act does not permit a person to be held under a regime of correction but only under a regime of detention and that the term  prison  should be read this way  The submission was that the prison in which the applicants were held  a correctional prison  was not a prison within the meaning of the Act  at    There  too  the applicants sought habeas corpus   As noted by Gray J in Cabal  at    prison  is a term of broad definition  It is defined in the Macquarie Dictionary as meaning   a public building for the confinement or safe custody of criminals and others committed by law   or   a place of confinement or involuntary restraint    The common law has accorded the term similar breadth  It encompasses both confinement and custody  Justice Gray concluded that Parliament intended  by s   to give the term  the broadest meaning   His Honour concluded that   the intention of s   of the Act is to ensure that  so far as practicable  those detained under the Extradition Act will not be treated as convicted criminals  but will be treated according to whatever regime exists in the particular state or territory for persons held in prison awaiting trial    at    In Victoria  there was no distinction between convicted and unconvicted prisoners  Where that was the case  the way in which a person was held under s   was not inconsistent with the terms of the Act  at    His Honour concluded  at   that even though Parliament sought to achieve the object of treating persons awaiting extradition as humanely as possible  there was no occasion for reading down the definition of  prison  to promote that underlying object or purpose   In Cabal   Gray J concluded  at   that there was no valid argument available to reduce the meaning of the term  prison  in s   of the Act so as to render it inapplicable to different classes of prison  Similarly  I am of the view that no arguable case for any breach of the Act on this basis has been made out  The term  prison  applies to the Remand Centre and to Parklea   The relevant NSW Act with respect to the administration of sentences is the Crimes  Administration of Sentences  Act    NSW   the Administration Act   There is nothing in the Administration Act or the Act which imposes any obligation on the NSW correctional authorities or the Commonwealth to accord to Mr Rivera segregation from convicted persons   The Remand Centre is a maximum security correctional facility  one of three correctional facilities which make up the Silverwater Correctional Complex  It operates for prisoners on remand  or awaiting transfer  or attending Court  Most inmates leave the Remand Centre within the first few months of arrival  This is either because they obtain bail and are released or they are classified and transferred to the centre of classification  Parklea is a correctional centre that houses remand and sentenced maximum and minimum security prisoners  Each of Parklea and the Remand Centre has  since   been declared a correctional centre pursuant to ss   and   of the Administration Act  That is  they have the same prison classification under the Administration Act   In Cabal  at   Gray J noted that Australia is a signatory to the Covenant and has ratified it  subject to certain conditions  One of those reservations is in Article   which provides       in relation to paragraph  a  the principle of segregation is accepted as an objective to achieved progressively   That reservation was in effect at the time of the decision in Cabal   There is no suggestion that it has been withdrawn and the parties accept that the reservation is still in force  After considering the Covenant and Australia s obligations in the light of the reservation and the Act in some detail  Gray J concluded  at   that the Act has a clear meaning which cannot be changed simply because one State has changed the manner in which it deals with prisoners awaiting trial  His Honour also held that  even if the actions of one state were such as to place Australia in breach of its international obligations  that would not change the meaning of the Act  Neither the Act nor the Administration Act impose any obligation on the NSW correctional authorities to accord Mr Rivera  or any other prisoner  segregation from convicted persons  Even if Mr Rivera s imprisonment at Parklea were a contravention of Australia s obligations under the Covenant  it would be of no assistance to him  The terms of the Covenant form no part of the law of Australia
