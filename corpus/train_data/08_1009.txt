Standen v Feehan   FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedBriginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The standard of proof is the civil standard  but because the claim is for a penalty  to the level of satisfaction in Briginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR   at     citedJones v Dunkel     CLR   In my opinion  in the absence of any explanation for failing to call Mr Carslake and none was proffered  it would be right to draw the inference that Mr Carslake s evidence would not have assisted the respondent on this and the other two relevant conversations  Jones v Dunkel     CLR    There is no suggestion that Mr Carslake was not available to be called and I find that a conscious decision was made not to call him   I accept Mr Zito s evidence and I find that on   May   Mr Feehan told Mr Zito that he would close the site down because Mr Zito s employees were not members of the Union and because the site lacked the appropriate facilities  I also find that either later on   May   or on   May   Mr Feehan attended the site with Mr Carslake and Mr Carslake spoke to Mr Zito and told Mr Zito that he would not be able to pour concrete the next day   The respondent said that he told Mr Zito that he would be back on   May    I accept that aspect of the respondent s evidence because it is consistent with both Mr Potter s and Mr Zito s evidence  Moreover  he did return on   May   as he promised followedO Reilly v The Commissioners of the State Bank of Victoria   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The issue to be determined is whether the respondent intentionally hindered or obstructed an employer or employee  That question is simply a question of fact  A person may intentionally hinder or obstruct another person by an active act or conduct which is essentially negative in character  O Reilly v The Commissioners of the State Bank of Victoria   HCA         CLR   at       Here the case against the respondent is that he did both  He both performed acts and failed to perform acts which showed that he intentionally hindered or obstructed both employers and employees   The Halifax Street site is on the corner of Halifax Street and Cardwell Street  Adelaide  It is on the southern side of Halifax Street and its eastern border was on Cardwell Street  Part of its southern border at that time was on Ely Place  The rest of its southern border was on Gilles Street  The site was owned by the Southcott family but it was the Kinsmen Group who was the developer of the site  Scott Salisbury Homes were in May   commencing to build eight separate two storey townhouses or units with separate strata titles on an area of the site called  Stage    Stage   was on the western boundary of the site near Ely Place  The only access to the site was from Halifax Street  there being no access either from Cardwell Street or Ely Place  The area of the site immediately adjacent to Halifax Street was called the common access roadway  It was into that area that traffic coming from Halifax Street onto the site would enter  Immediately south of the common access area and to the east of Stage   was an area undergoing remediation  There was an access lane area between Stage   and the area undergoing remediation upon which traffic  including trucks  could travel to get access to all of Stage    Trucks could not turn in that access lane area  If a truck needed to turn it had to turn into the common access area immediately off Halifax Street  If a truck wanted to travel down the access lane area  the truck driver would have had to back down the lane if the truck driver wished to drive out nose first  or back out if the truck driver had chosen to drive in nose first  The common access area was sometimes used as a parking area for employees on the site and had been so used prior to the day in question followedPine v Doyle     IR   Such a finding is consistent with him telling Mr Zito that he would be back the next day and with his later actions  He parked his car next to Rocky Mastrullo s truck  Shortly after he alighted from his car  he was approached by Mr Potter  He was asked to remove his car from the site  A conversation ensued  During the conversation Mr Potter asked to see the respondent s permit and the written notice of entry  The respondent disputed that he needed a written notice and claimed that Mr Potter knew that he would be there that day  The respondent showed Mr Potter his permit as he was obliged to do under s  D   The exercise of a power of entry under the Act is a matter of fact  Pine v Doyle     IR    The respondent exercised that power of entry   Mr Potter told him to move his vehicle and told him that the vehicle was parked in a position which would impede the progress of concrete trucks which needed that space in which to turn so that the trucks might back down the access lane to the Stage   development  The respondent did not comply with that request  notwithstanding that he was told that the position of his car was in an area designated for the trucks to turn  His silence amounted to a refusal   It was at the time the practice of the Building Industry Task Force to maintain a running sheet as a record of matters that were attended to on particular days  Mr Concannon kept a running sheet of the events of   May   which was exhibited to his affidavit
