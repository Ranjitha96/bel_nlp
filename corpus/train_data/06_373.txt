Harris v Trustee Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedCommissioner for Superannuation v Scott     ALR   The Tribunal next drew attention to the following dicta of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  comprising Deputy President R A Layton and B C Lock and J T B Linn as members  in Re Schlatter and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority and Brown     ALD   at   in a context of eligibility for defence force retirement pension and death benefits  where dependency was explained as  a financial concept as distinct from an emotional concept       To similar effect in Commissioner for Superannuation v Scott     ALR   the notions of  financial dependency   necessities of life  and  lower order needs  were emphasised   Those authorities were apparently cited to the Tribunal by the Trustee for the propositions that the statutory notion of  dependence  the subject of ss  A and  B of the Superannuation Act relates to financial support for  necessities of life  or  lower order needs  and that  financial dependence    in the situation of an applicant for relief meant being  primarily  essentially or in the main dependent upon the person    Moreover the words  in the main  were said by the Tribunal to indicate that total dependence is not required  and further that the Tribunal indicated its expectation that so much would be less so for the notion of   substantially dependent    the s  A a  expression  than for financial dependence without qualification  As for the terms   necessities of life   and   lower order needs   the Tribunal considered on the other hand that the same should not be taken to mean   bare necessities    that is  the minimum needed to survive in indigent circumstances  Faull was said by the Tribunal to seemingly support the view in any event that a more reasonable interpretation should be adopted having regard to the person s station in life  and the Tribunal observed indeed in that context of its reasoning as follows     There is no suggestion from the evidence that the  appellant s  lifestyle was excessive  yet she appears to have been having some difficulties in meeting her normal expenditure without the financial support given by the  deceased    Nevertheless in the Tribunal s concluding view  the position here involved was properly addressed and dealt with by Scott  the reasoning whereof the Tribunal purportedly adopted  The Tribunal summarised the reasoning in Scott on what may be described as the  wholly or substantially dependent  issue  that is  picking up reference to  wholly and substantially   in s  A a  as follows     In that case  the Federal Court was considering the meaning of the expression  wholly or substantially dependent  in the definition of  spouse  in s   of the Relevant Act  as it then was  the current s   does not contain a definition of  spouse   The Court came to the view that where the word  substantially  finds its place in the phrase  wholly or substantially dependent  it must be construed having regard to the whole phrase  This was because where the word  substantially  is placed within that phrase  connotations of the term  substantially  is governed by the conjugational position of the word  wholly  immediately before it  In other words  that  substantial  does not stand alone  but is related to  wholly   On this basis  the Court came to the view that  substantially  does not simply mean something more than trivial  minimal or nominal  instead it meant in relation to a person in the expression  wholly or substantially dependent  that the person is primarily  essentially or in the main dependent upon a person  that is  upon the Deceased Member   The Court also cautioned against the use of percentage and instead suggested as the approach to consider whether the person  the Complainant  is primarily  essentially or in the main dependent upon the other person  the Deceased Member  in the context of that particular relationship    The Tribunal proceeded to point out that the foregoing view as to whole or substantial dependence  summarised by the Full Federal Court in Scott   was applied in the context of the joint judgment of Branson and Hely JJ in Graovac  comparedFaull v Superannuation Complaints Tribunal  Supreme Court of New South Wales   November    unreported  The Tribunal indicated its awareness moreover that       it is common in many other superannuation schemes for the dependence test for similar situations to be whether the claimant was  wholly or partially  dependent on the deceased  and where  quite small regular payments have been found to be sufficient to constitute partial dependency   The Tribunal was referred to Faull v Superannuation Complaints Tribunal  Supreme Court of New South Wales   November   unreported  where the deceased had died about the same time as the deceased member  and where the mother who worked and earned  some   per annum  was held to be partially dependent on her son who paid her   per week board each week  being payments that were made regularly and could apparently be relied upon  even though they may not have made a great difference to the mother s standard of living  Nevertheless the Court held as follows     The payment of that amount augmented her other income and  to that extent  she was dependent upon the deceased for receipt of some of her income  Accordingly  she was  partially dependent  upon the payment made by the deceased    The s  A a  tests refer to  wholly or substantially dependent on the other person at the time    In the present case  as the Tribunal pointed out  in the final period of time prior to his death  the deceased was giving the appellant about   per fortnight or   per year  representing an additional ten per centum   on her gross income derived  The Tribunal further pointed to evidence that the appellant had found a need for further income  as a consequence whereof she had commenced weekend work  but ceased that work at the deceased s request  In that context  the Tribunal drew the following conclusions     It seems that it was the payments made to her by the  deceased  that enabled her to do this  Moreover  the   per fortnight seems to have become fairly regular and it may well be that the  appellant  came to rely upon it  otherwise  she is unlikely to have given up the weekend work   If the test here were partial dependency  on the basis of Faull  such payments might well be sufficient for dependency to exist      But in this case  the test is  wholly or substantially dependent  not  wholly or partially   or even just  partially  dependent  The question is whether these tests are virtually the same or significantly different  Both have quantitative aspects  albeit of uncertain dimensions  The Tribunal sees issues like whether the payments were secured in some way to the  appellant  as being of less importance than whether they were relatively regular in such a way that she reasonably rely upon them continuing   The Tribunal next drew attention to the following dicta of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  comprising Deputy President R A Layton and B C Lock and J T B Linn as members  in Re Schlatter and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority and Brown     ALD   at   in a context of eligibility for defence force retirement pension and death benefits  where dependency was explained as  a financial concept as distinct from an emotional concept       To similar effect in

the main  were said by the Tribunal to indicate that total dependence is not required  and further that the Tribunal indicated its expectation that so much would be less so for the notion of

the other hand that the same should not be taken to mean   bare necessities    that is  the minimum needed to survive in indigent circumstances  Faull was said by the Tribunal to seemingly support the view in any event that a more reasonable interpretation should be adopted having regard to the person s station in life  and the Tribunal observed indeed in that context of its reasoning as follows     There is no suggestion from the evidence that the  appellant s  lifestyle was excessive  yet she appears to have been having some difficulties in meeting her normal expenditure without the financial support given by the  deceased   discussedFurmage v Social Security Commission     New Zealand Administrative Reports Vol   page   Accordingly the Tribunal reasoned that just as in normal parlance  it seemed to be unlikely that the relationship between the appellant and the deceased member  whereby they occupied separate residences  but saw one another regularly and even slept together on occasions  was one that would normally be described as  ordinarily living together    or necessarily  permanent   or as having a  bona fide domestic basis    within par  b  of s  A   The Tribunal considered that the following dictum of Barker J in Furmage v Social Security Commission       NZ AR   at   to be here apposite  involving as it did the operation of the expression  living together on a domestic basis  appearing in certain New Zealand social security legislation as follows        the Commission may in its discretion    regard as husband and wife  any man and woman who  not being legally married  are in the opinion of the Commission living together on a domestic basis as husband and wife and may in its discretion    terminate or reduce    any benefit already granted accordingly       As to the operation of that expression  the Commission contended as follows     Obviously all the elements of consortium need not appear in every relationship under  the legislative provision  just as they need not necessarily appear in every marriage  However  the Legislature has chosen to emphasise one element of consortium ie the  living together under one roof  aspect by its use of the words  on a domestic basis   The section requires more than      cohabitation     and more than not  living apart      but     has gone out of its way to add these limiting words to an otherwise fairly broad and flexible concept   As I have already indicated  the Tribunal considered that there was no qualifying marital relationship between the appellant and the deceased within s  A  of the Superannuation Act essentially for the reasons I have summarised as well as cited  nor within what may be described as the deeming and illustrative provisions of s  A   Accordingly in the Tribunal s opinion  whether the Trustee s decision was fair and reasonable in its operation depended on whether the circumstances of the appellant came within the scope of s  B  of the Superannuation Act   So much also involved or concerned the issue whether the appellant was   wholly or substantially dependent   on the deceased at the time of his death within s  A    being the further issue to which I will now turn   For the purposes of addressing that further issue  the Tribunal accepted  as indeed the Trustee pointed out  the extent of variation in the closeness of the relationship between the appellant and the deceased  over the years  but considered that       it is the period nearest to  the time of death  that is the most important   since    e ven if earlier in the relationship the  appellant  was not so dependent  that is irrelevant if she was so dependent at the time of death   and the Tribunal considered accordingly   that it is most appropriate to concentrate on the last years and  having regard to s  A  of the Act  the last three years  which is from   on     The appellant made a further  major complaint    that the Tribunal referred to the New Zealand case of Furmage   though not in relation to the passage from its reasons which I have earlier cited therefrom  but in relation to an earlier passage in those reasons at   where the following appears     However  I cannot ignore the additional words of the statute  on a domestic basis   I consider that these words require a living together under the same roof on a basis of some permanence    It is apparent  from the Tribunal s citation of that passage  that the Tribunal had in mind part of the text of par  b  of subs  A  where reference appears to      ordinarily lived with that other person as that other person s husband or wife on a permanent and bona fide domestic basis     It does not seem to me to have been inapposite to cite  whether for comparison or illustration of reasoning  that instance of judicial consideration of what was a not dissimilar text of statutory regulation  In the normal course  for a married couple to live under the same roof would at least assist exemplification as to what might constitute in certain circumstances   ordinarily lived  by a       husband or wife on a permanent and bona fide domestic basis   with the other  Of course exceptional circumstances  such as residing in accommodation whilst absent for instance interstate on business  or in the course of visitation overseas of relatives  or in the course of hospitalisation  would normally fulfil in any event the subs  A  circumstance of   temporary absence     It follows from those conclusions that the appeal should be dismissed       I certify that the preceding forty four   numbered paragraphs are a true

relationship  and concluded that whilst there are  various criteria to consider  there is no hard and fast rule that must be complied with in deciding whether a  marital relationship  existed    Initially the Trustee drew attention to two authorities of the early decades of the twentieth century which exemplified traditional notions of the matrimonial relationship  but moved promptly thereafter to the more contemporary analysis of juridical decisions of the last three decades  commencing with the discussion approvingly by Evatt CJ  Demack and Watson JJ  in the context of their joint judgment In the Marriage of Pavey     FLR   of what had been earlier said In the Marriage of Todd  No       FLR   at   by Watson J as follows     In my view  separation  means more than physical separation it involves the destruction of the marital relationship    Separation can only occur in the sense used by the Act where one or both of the spouses form the intention to sever or not to resume the marital relationship and act on that intention  or alternatively act as if the marital relationship has been severed  What comprises the marital relationship for each couple will vary  Marriage involves many elements some or all of which may be present in a particular marriage elements such as dwelling under the same roof  sexual intercourse  mutual society and protection  recognition of the existence of the marriage by both spouses in public and private relationships      When it is asserted that a separation has taken place it may be necessary to examine and contrast the state of the marital relationship before and after the alleged separation  Whether there has been a separation will be a question of fact to be determined in each case    The foregoing sentence  w hat comprises the marital relationship for each couple will vary  was adopted by the Tribunal as reflective of  a practical  commonsense point of view    In that context of authority  the Tribunal thought that  t he Complainant and the Deceased Member  for their own purposes  over a period  fashioned a relationship that suited them and they may well have regarded it as the most appropriate marriage for them in all their circumstances    the Tribunal adding the observation that    i t is even quite arguable that it may have been a  marital relationship  at common law  which is what the Complainant s lawyers seem to have been submitting    So much was described by the Tribunal however as not determinative of the issue presently arising  and understandably so  in the light of the critical words of s  A  which at least include      the person ordinarily lived with that other person as that other person s husband or wife on a permanent and bona fide basis   appliedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Graovac   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  As to the import and operation of  wholly and substantially  appearing in ss  A a  and  B d  I was referred to an analysis of the statutory notion of whole or substantial dependency appearing in the reasons the joint judgment of Branson and Hely JJ in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Graovac   FCA     being a decision made otherwise than in a matrimonial context  After reference to usages in statutory contexts of superannuation  social security and bankruptcy legislation  the following appears at     of that joint judgment     Thus Scott s case  and cases which have followed it  treat  substantially  in the phrase  wholly or substantially dependent  as involving the notion of predominance  When the Full Court in Scott adopted the paraphrase of a person who is  primarily  essentially or in the main  dependent upon another person  in our opinion the Court was describing  in slightly different ways  the same idea  rather than expressing three slightly different ideas  That colours or confines the signification of  essentially       We respectfully disagree with  the primary judge s  conclusion     that A is wholly or substantially dependent on B as well as on C  A is dependent upon both  but is not wholly or substantially dependent on B because it is upon C that A is mainly dependent  Whilst B s contribution may be essential to A s support  the notion of predominance which is implicit in the phrase  wholly or substantially  dependent  is lacking    Although that dicta occurred of course in relation to a different legislative context  its emphasis on   the notion of predominance   seems to me to carry through by way of assistance to the resolution of the issues of legislative construction here arising   The Tribunal considered that   the real question is not whether the ultimate relationship of the  appellant  and the Deceased Member was a  marital relationship  at common law  but rather whether it was a  marital relationship  for the purposes of ss  A and  B   of the Superannuation Act   which the Tribunal described   as a materially different issue    The Tribunal s reasoning continued to the effect that for the purposes of the Superannuation Act   s  A  stipulates that there is a  marital relationship if two people ordinarily lived together as husband and wife on a permanent and bona fide domestic basis at the relevant time  and further that it was   fairly clear   that those s  A  terms such as   ordinarily     lived together     permanent   and   bona fide domestic basis   imported requirements over and above those that may be necessary for an undefined marital relationship  and should not be regarded as merely surplusage  There is clear force in those observations   Nevertheless in the Tribunal s concluding view  the position here involved was properly addressed and dealt with by Scott  the reasoning whereof the Tribunal purportedly adopted  The Tribunal summarised the reasoning in Scott on what may be described as the  wholly or substantially dependent  issue  that is  picking up reference to  wholly and substantially   in s  A a  as follows     In that case  the Federal Court was considering the meaning of the expression  wholly or substantially dependent  in the definition

context of the joint judgment of Branson and Hely JJ in Graovac  discussedRe Schlatter and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority and Brown       ALD   The Tribunal next drew attention to the following dicta of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  comprising Deputy President R A Layton and B C Lock and J T B Linn as members  in Re Schlatter and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority and Brown     ALD   at   in a context of eligibility for defence force retirement pension and death benefits  where dependency was explained as  a financial concept as distinct from an emotional concept       To similar effect in Commissioner for Superannuation v Scott     ALR   the notions of  financial dependency   necessities of life  and  lower order needs  were emphasised   Those authorities were apparently cited to the Tribunal by the Trustee for the propositions that the statutory notion of  dependence  the subject of ss  A and  B of the Superannuation Act relates to financial support for  necessities of life  or  lower order needs  and that  financial dependence    in the situation of an applicant for relief meant being  primarily  essentially or in the main dependent upon the person    Moreover the words  in the main  were said by the Tribunal to indicate that total dependence is not required  and further that the Tribunal indicated its expectation that so much would be less so for the notion of   substantially dependent    the s  A a  expression  than for financial dependence without qualification  As for the terms   necessities of life   and   lower order needs   the Tribunal considered on the other hand that the same should not be taken to mean   bare necessities    that is  the minimum needed to survive in indigent circumstances  Faull was said by the Tribunal to seemingly support the view in any event that a more reasonable interpretation should be adopted having regard to the person s station in life  and the Tribunal observed indeed in that context of its reasoning as follows     There is no suggestion from the evidence that the  appellant s  lifestyle was excessive  yet she appears to have been having some difficulties in meeting her normal expenditure without the financial support given by the  deceased   discussedTodd and Todd  No       ALR  discussedRoy v Sturgeon     NSWLR   The appellant submitted in any event that what constitutes  living together on a bona fide basis  is a matter to be determined on the facts of each case  drawing attention thereby to dictum of Powell J in Roy v Sturgeon     NSWLR   at     where the following appears         it seems to me that each case will involve the Court making a value judgment having regard to a variety of factors relating to the particular relationship  those factors including  but not being limited to  the following       the duration of the relationship       the nature and extent of the common residence       whether or not a sexual relationship existed       the degree of financial interdependence  and any arrangements for support  between or by the parties       the ownership  use and acquisition of property       the procreation of children       the care and support of children       the performance of household duties       the degree of mutual commitment and mutual support       reputation and  public  aspects of the relationship    Those observations in Roy were made in the context of the De Facto Relationships Act    NSW  where the statutory definition of   de facto relationship   meant   the relationship between de facto partners  being the relationship of living or having lived together as husband and wife on a bona fide domestic basis although not married to each other    Sections  A and  B of the subject legislation were of course enacted in   and the text thereof is more specific than the earlier State of New South Wales legislation addressed in Roy   Part of the present statutory criteria addresses inter alia the s  A d  requirement to consider evidence establishing whether   the persons jointly owned a home which was their usual residence     In any event  the appellant s submissions continued to the effect that by limiting itself to a consideration of whether there was a common residence  the Tribunal applied the wrong test and failed to take account of other significant indicators such as what the couple themselves considered their relationship to be and what others  who knew the couple  considered the relationship to be  I have encountered difficult with that submission by the appellant  which to my perception derives insufficient support from the text of ss  A and  B  whether explicitly or implicitly   Thereafter the appellant referred to the opinion of the Tribunal      that when the  Superannuation  Act speaks of dependency it is referring primarily to financial dependency  so it is the sums of money paid by the Deceased Member to the Complainant in the period prior to his death that seem the most important consideration  and contended that in so finding  the Tribunal ignored the ordinary meaning of the word dependency which can include emotional and or physical dependency  Emotional dependency is not readily susceptible of course to financial measurement  The criteria described by ss  A and  B are necessarily or at least expediently objective  and although subjective factors may well be sometimes relevant in evidentiary terms in order to throw light upon the satisfaction or otherwise objectively of the statutory requirement as to   ordinarily living on a permanent and bona fide domestic basis   it is not apparent that the same may compellingly enter the ultimate assessment or computation of a pension entitlement of a surviving spouse or partner otherwise existing pursuant to the Superannuation Act
