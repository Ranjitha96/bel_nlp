 Burchett J noted that the successful first respondent had raised a number of objections on which it failed  which added the last half day to the hearing  In exercising his discretion against the first respondent on this issue  his Honour held at     A party against whom an unsustainable claim is prosecuted is not to be forced  at his peril in respect of costs  to abandon every defence he is not sure of maintaining  and oppose to his adversary only the barrier of one hopeful argument  he is entitled to raise his earthworks at every reasonable point along the path of assault  At the same time  if he multiplies issues unreasonably  he may suffer in costs  Ultimately  the question is one of discretion and judgment  In my judgment  the competing considerations will be reflected  and justice will be done  if the costs to be recovered by the first respondent are shorn of any amount attributable to the last day of hearing referred toBHP Billiton Iron Pty Ltd v National Competition

Razzi  No       FCR   at   Wilcox J said    In these days of extensive court delays and high legal costs the courts should use all proper means to encourage parties to consider carefully what matters they will put in issue in their litigation  If parties come to realise that they will not necessarily recover the whole of their costs  even though they have unsuccessfully raised a discrete issue  they are likely better to consider whether the raising of that issue is a justifiable course to take   This approach was essentially adopted by Hodgson CJ in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd v FAI

penalising a party for supporting their case in every reasonable way  his Honour stated at       Apart from that consideration  in general terms I accept that if an issue is raised reasonably and is not disproportionate to the whole case  then normally the successful party should get his or her costs  However  particularly in relation to severable issues  the lesser the strength of the point raised and the greater the proportion it bears to the whole case  the more likely it is that the successful party may be deprived of costs  and if the Court comes to the view that it was unreasonable

in Cummings v Lewis     FCR   at       Although  I note that Cooper J  in referring to the above passage of Wilcox J  in the decision of Cummings   FCR at   said    Wilcox J was of the view that to persist in a denial that the statements as found were made was unreasonable and was conduct which unreasonably prolonged the proceedings  It is no answer to say that a party is entitled to test the evidence to show that nothing was said which might amount to the representations as pleaded  A party always has that right in litigation  However  the question which is relevant to the issue as to costs is whether or not the exercise of that right  or the manner in which it was exercised  was reasonable in all the circumstances  and  whether the exercise of the right had the effect of unreasonably prolonging the proceedings  It was this issue which Wilcox J found against the respondents and upon which he based his decision   There must be some element connected to the proceeding to make it fair and reasonable to deprive a successful litigant of its costs  A good reason not to follow the ordinary rule may arise because of the unreasonable or inappropriate conduct of the successful litigant  It may also arise where there is an ability to identify separate issues or inquiries where the successful litigant has failed   There may be other circumstances in which there needs to be some qualification to the starting point of presuming that the successful party is entitled to its costs where justice requires it  Any determination will always depend on the circumstances arising for the decision of the judge who has conducted the trial and who is considering the appropriate order as to costs   The fact that a successful party has lost on a particular issue or inquiry does not necessarily mean that the party has acted in the litigation inappropriately or unreasonably  Nevertheless  in certain circumstances  it may be an appropriate exercise of the court s discretion to apportion costs according to success or failure on a particular distinct or severable issue or inquiry irrespective of any inappropriate or unreasonable behaviour on the part of the successful party  see Cummings   FCR at     Hughes   ATPR at   citedDodds Family Investments Pty Ltd  formerly Solar Tint Pty Ltd  v Lane Industries Pty Ltd     IPR   Considerations of public policy and  in particular  the need for greater economy and efficiency in the conduct of litigation are relevant considerations in the exercise of the discretion when considering whether a successful party is entitled to all its costs  see  e g  Dodds Family Investments Pty Ltd  formerly Solar Tint Pty Ltd  Lane Industries Pty Ltd     IPR   at       It is sometimes preferable after apportioning issues as I have done to avoid leaving the quantification and fixing of costs of those issues to taxation  I am mindful that an allocation of costs in the case of a mixed result can rarely be achieved with mathematical precision and such is not necessary  Dodds   IPR at   per Gummow  French and Hill JJ  Unfortunately  I do not have any appropriate material to estimate the amount of costs or time spent on the preparation and consideration of the economic test prior to trial  and so cannot make any percentage apportionment of the costs to be discounted  I therefore propose to order a deduction

Interbulk Ltd     All ER   and Dr Martens Pty Ltd v Figgins Holdings Pty Ltd  No     FCA     As Goldberg J observed in Dr Martens   FCA   at        A  court should be reluctant to embrace the proposition that  as a general rule  it is appropriate to undertake an enquiry as to who was successful in relation to particular issues in a case to determine whether there should be an apportionment of costs against a successful party  A court should not be too ready to disallow costs simply because a party has failed upon an issue  unless it be quite a separate and distinct issue from the issues in respect of which it succeeded or unless there be some element of unreasonableness or inappropriate conduct in relation to that issue  cf Verna Trading Pty Ltd v New India Assurance Pty Ltd     VR   at       It seems appropriate when considering separate and distinct issues or inquiries  where there is no element of unreasonableness or inappropriate behaviour on behalf of the successful litigant  to consider appropriate case management principles  the relative merits or strengths of the lost issue or inquiry  whether the length of the proceedings had been greatly increased by the lost issue or inquiry on which the successful party failed  and whether the issue or inquiry on which the successful party failed otherwise was of sufficient significance in proportion to the whole case to warrant a special order to deprive that party of the costs of that issue referred toHamersley Iron Pty Ltd v National Competition Council     ALR   It is significant to recall that all parties needed to confront the principal question in the proceedings on the basis there existed only one previous decision of the Court that of Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd v National Competition Council     ALR     Hamersley   which dealt with the interpretation of the term  use of a production process  within s  B of the Act and which involved a very similar factual scenario to the proceedings  Fortescue s principal contention was that  applying the  marketable commodity  test to the factual scenario as contended for by Fortescue  a  marketable commodity  was produced in BHPBIO s operations before the iron ore was railed to the port  As an alternative contention  Fortescue sought to distinguish Hamersley on a number of grounds   BHPBIO had good legal grounds for its position and conducted itself in the litigation reasonably and appropriately  Nevertheless  BHPBIO was the losing party  and Fortescue would ordinarily be entitled to its costs  However  despite Fortescue s ultimate success in the proceedings  I did not find in favour of Fortescue on certain factual and legal issues or inquiries  Nevertheless  I do not consider it appropriate in the circumstances to disentitle Fortescue to its whole costs in the proceedings   The conduct of Fortescue in this proceeding was neither inappropriate nor unreasonable  Fortescue structured its case primarily on the basis of the correctness of the decision in Hamersley   Therefore  it seems to me that seeking to apply the  marketable commodity  test as expounded in that decision was an entirely appropriate and reasonable approach  Further  it seems to me that Fortescue seeking in the alternative to distinguish the Hamersley decision on a number of grounds was similarly appropriate and reasonable  In addition  I do not see any inappropriate or unreasonable behaviour on the part of Fortescue in its approach to putting BHPBIO to proof on factual matters or contentions  The Court accepted in essence the actual process and operations as contended for by BHPBIO  However  the conclusions of the Court were determined objectively and not by reference to BHPBIO s own subjective views or characterisations  or by reference to the subjective views or characterisations of the witnesses called on behalf of BHPBIO  Fortescue was entitled to test the evidence put forward by BHPBIO  especially in respect of such subjective views and characterisations   In Hamersley   the learned trial judge held the term  production process  meant  a series of operations by which a marketable commodity is created or manufactured  at    The test required  as a question of  fact and degree  a consideration of  the actual operation of the activities in question  considered as a whole  at    The evidence as to  marketable commodity  whilst it may be separately identified  was all part of the material the Court needed to consider in determining the actual operation of the activities in question  Accordingly  it does not seem unreasonable for Fortescue to have approached in the way it did the material placed before the Court  The principal question for determination in the proceedings was not a mere matter of statutory interpretation of the term  the use of a production process  that could be dealt with by demurrer  Rather  the Court was required to consider  in detail  the factual evidence of BHPBIO s operations and apply the construction of the term  the use of a production process  whether that construction be the one set out in Hamersley   or the construction for which the Court ultimately found  There does not seem to me to be any element of unreasonableness or inappropriateness in Fortescue directing its evidence  submissions and cross examination to the application of that test to the facts of this case   This is not the end of the inquiry  As I have indicated  the exercise of the discretion to make an order as to costs is not just limited to a consideration of the reasonableness or appropriateness of the conduct of a party in connection with the proceedings  It may also be appropriate to discount an order in favour of a successful litigant in circumstances where it has lost certain issues or inquiries which can clearly be treated as distinct and severable   At the outset  I do not consider that the matters upon which Fortescue was unsuccessful were relevantly distinct or severable although they can be identified  Rather  the matters on which Fortescue was unsuccessful were alternative arguments in support of the one principal question in the proceedings  that is  whether either of the relevant services was a  service  within the meaning of s  B of the Act  The matters raised by Fortescue were sufficiently linked to this principal question in the proceedings  Fortescue did not seek to raise a separate matter for determination by way of a positive defence   However  to the extent the issues or inquiries upon which Fortescue lost can be identified  and even if they be relevantly distinct and severable  in my view  none of the matters sought to be addressed by Fortescue were so disproportionate to the whole case  or so lacked merit  or so adversely impacted upon the economy and efficiency of the proceedings  according to case management principles  as to warrant an order to deprive Fortescue of some or all of its costs  As I have said  I was required to consider in detail the factual evidence and apply that evidence to the construction of the term  use of a production process  which Fortescue reasonably contested  The ultimate ends of justice would not be served by Fortescue not recovering its costs because of its failure on some identifiable  or even distinct and severable  issues or inquiries  when those issues or inquiries needed to be canvassed as being material to the reaching of a decision appliedHamersley Iron Pty Ltd v National Competition Council   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd v National Competition Council   FCA     Kenny J considered the apportionment of costs and reduced the costs awarded to the successful applicant to reflect  amongst other things  costs associated with certain affidavit evidence ruled to be inadmissible   Similarly  here  a reduction of costs awarded to NCC would be appropriate in view of my rejection of the economic test  This was an issue which could be treated as clearly distinct and severable  it being in effect a positive contention raised by the NCC in its points of defence and amended points of defence  which had little merit and did add to the costs of preparation of the parties for trial  Whilst I do not have sufficient material to assess such costs  I am satisfied they are not merely minimal   Professor Rey  the economic expert called on behalf of the NCC  and the other economic experts before me agreed that the term  production process  had no technical or specialised meaning in economics  In these circumstances  it is difficult to see how the economic test could be relevant to the contention that Hamersley was wrongly decided or could provide an appropriate replacement test citedHughes v Western Australian Cricket Association

austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  I should interpolate that there may not need to be the ability to precisely identify separate costs in respect of particular issues  As Campbell J said in Roberts v Rodier   NSWSC   at           I do not accept that the appropriate way of exercising the costs discretion is limited to the identification of separate costs of particular issues  It could sometimes be within the scope of a proper exercise of discretion  where the costs of certain evidence was relevant to issues on which a plaintiff succeeded and also to issues on which the plaintiff failed  to decide to allow the plaintiff a proportion only of those costs   Whilst the cases referred to above throw light on the relevant principles to be applied in the exercise of the discretion  their application to the facts of a particular case is sometimes difficult when competing considerations apply   As I understand the principles relevant to my task  they can be summarised as follows       A successful litigant is ordinarily entitled to its costs even if the losing party had good legal grounds for its position and conducted itself in the litigation reasonably and appropriately     The successful litigant will be so entitled to its costs unless some good reason connected to the case is shown to the contrary     Without limiting the general discretion available  a good reason to the contrary may arise            Where the conduct of the successful litigant in connection with the case was unreasonable or inappropriate      Where no such unreasonable or inappropriate conduct of the successful litigant is found  but nevertheless there were clearly distinct and severable issues or inquiries that were lost by the successful litigant           If the conduct of a successful litigant was inappropriate or unreasonable in connection with the case  the successful litigant will usually be denied all or part of its costs     Where the court is considering the question of costs in respect of a lost distinct or severable issue or inquiry  which can clearly be treated as distinct and severable  then to determine whether the successful party will lose some or all of its costs  it will be necessary to consider and weigh up case management principles  the significance of the issue or inquiry in proportion to the proceeding as a whole  and whether the issue or inquiry had any relative strength or merit     The court has the discretion to apportion costs even if it cannot identify separate costs in respect of distinct or severable issues or inquiries on which the successful litigant failed  but the matters on which the party failed must be at least capable of separation from the matters on which the litigant was successful citedRuddock v Vadarlis  No     FCA         FCR
