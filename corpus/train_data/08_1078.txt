au au cases cth FCA  html  I delivered judgment in this matter on   March   Coombes v Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations   FCA    I reserved the question of costs  and gave the parties the opportunity to exchange written submissions on costs referred toColgate Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd     FCR   Both the first and second respondents seek costs of the proceedings to date on an indemnity basis against the applicants  relying upon the principles discussed in Colgate Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd     FCR   at     and alternatively party and party costs  The applicants contend that no order as to costs should be made at all in the circumstances   In the proceeding the applicants unsuccessfully sought orders requiring the second respondent  the Administrator of the Nyangatjatjara Aboriginal Corporation  NAC  under the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act    Cth   the Act  to take certain steps in the administration relating to the preparation of a Register of Members  to the calling of certain general meetings  and to the preparation of certain reports with a view to having the NAC return to the control of its members  They also unsuccessfully sought orders requiring the first respondent to require the second respondent to establish a current Register of Members of the NAC and for declaratory orders as to the proper operation of the Act   In my view the application for indemnity costs should be refused referred toFountain Select Meats  Sales  Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Although I concluded  for the reasons I expressed  that the applicants  claims should not succeed  that was a view reached after hearing all of the evidence  By way of an extreme example  had there been total inactivity by the second respondent appointed under the Act  and had the first respondent been indifferent to that circumstance  the Court may have concluded that some error of law underlay that inactivity  The point is that the conclusions generally depended upon findings made on the evidence  There were some orders sought which I found simply not to be available as a matter of law  but on those matters the hearing including submissions was relatively brief in the context of the entire hearing  I do not therefore consider  viewed overall  that the applicants  claims were so unreasonable or so unlikely to succeed  or that they conducted their case in such a manner  that an award of indemnity costs should be made  Compare Fountain Select Meats  Sales  Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR   at   citedRitter v Godfrey     KB   The applicants identified a number of matters relevant to whether the normal order as to costs should apply  It is necessary to identify special circumstances which would lead to departure from the general rule that costs should follow the event  Ritter v Godfrey     KB     Ritter   at least at a practical level   The first was that the administration of the NAC was initiated by the first respondent  and then the applicants were in effect obliged to institute proceedings because the respondents denied them information about the progress of the administration  The applicants were the Anangu  ie representatives of the three Aboriginal Communities directly affected by the appointment of the second respondent  As the evidence in the proceedings showed  there was a real concern on the part of the first respondent about the maintenance of a Register of Members by the Governing Committee of the NAC before the appointment of an Administrator and a real concern about how the then members of the Governing Committee came to hold their offices  as well as about other matters concerning the administration of the NAC   However  at a practical level  I do not think there is any doubt that at least informally the applicants were all  or almost all  members of the Governing Committee  at least a de facto governing committee  of the NAC at the time of the appointment  They were  and remain  genuinely and properly interested in the well being of the NAC on an ongoing basis and the effect of the administration upon its affairs  The NAC and its subsidiary or associated activities was a very substantial enterprise  That proper interest  in the practical sense  arose from the applicants being representatives of the Anangu as well as their previous status  It is also apparent from the evidence that the applicants  through their solicitors  invited the respondents to keep them informed as to the progress of the administration but that their requests for information were largely unsatisfied  That circumstance must be seen in context  Their request for information was  on occasions  more than that  assertions that the second respondent  and later the first respondent  should do things which they allegedly had not done  and that the second respondent was doing things detrimental to the interests of NAC  That may explain  in large measure  why the applicants  requests for information were not satisfied  In addition  the respondents took the view that their asserted position as officers of the NAC was in doubt for the reasons already given  Nevertheless  no other persons more obviously than the applicants were identified as persons from the Anangu who might have been kept informed of the progress of the administration  and I think it was appropriate that  by some means  the Anangu should have been kept generally informed as to its progress  It is therefore understandable that the applicants were  invited   to use the word used by them in submissions  to commence proceedings by the respondent  I shall return to this feature later in these reasons   The applicants also contended that any order for costs against them  given that they were seeking to involve themselves in the administration of the NAC and in the light of its very significant interest to their communities  would  send a message to Aboriginal persons not to involve themselves in such matters   I place little weight on that factor  An applicant has a perceived interest in the matters raised in the particular proceeding in every circumstance  and not uncommonly that interest is shared with others  Sometimes  for that reason  the applicant is supported by others interested  including support as to the costs of the proceeding  But it is no principle of law that the fact that the proceedings are brought by one person  inter alia  for the indirect benefit of others or because there are others interested in the outcome means that that applicant should not be obliged to pay the respondents  costs if the proceedings are unsuccessful  Nor is there any principle  so far as I am aware  that the exercise of the costs discretion should be exercised differently because the applicants are indigenous persons  I do not think the applicants meant to submit that   No restrictive interpretation of  good cause  has been imposed  Bowen LJ said in Jones v Curling     QBD   at        good cause  really seems to me to mean that there must exist facts which might reasonably lead the judge to think that the rule of the costs following the event would not produce justice as complete as the exceptional order which he himself could make  Now  to ascertain the existence of such facts the judge should look in the first place at the result of the action itself    and he should look also at the conduct of the parties to see whether either of them had in anyway involved the other unnecessarily in the expense of litigation     On the other hand  the conduct relevant to  good cause  must exhibit a connection with the institution or conduct of the proceedings  see Huxley v West London Extension Railway Co     App Cas   at     per Lord Watson  Bostock v Ramsey Urban District Council     QB   at   per Romer LJ  Some illustrations of circumstances in which the Court has considered whether to exercise the costs discretion other than in favour of the successful party are given by Ritter   Schaftenaar and Trade Practices Commission v Nicholas

No     FSC    The Court declined to order costs against the unsuccessful appellant because the unusual circumstances of the case involved matters of high public importance and raised the question of the liberty of individuals who could not take action on their own behalf in the determination of their rights  In declining to order costs  the Court considered inter alia  the fact that the

financial gain to those respondents in pursuing the matter   In Geeveekay   even though the appeal involved an important question of law  the resolution of which was in the public interest  namely whether the terms of certain contracts for the sale of land were credit contracts  regulated by the Consumer Credit Code  Vic    the proceeding was of a private nature  In effect  the applicant in Geeveekay brought the appeal in the pursuit of its own commercial interests  and there was no sufficient reason to distinguish it from other private litigation between a member of the public and a government agency  The present case  in my view  falls within the latter category   Finally  the applicants contended that  because the costs of the first respondent could be recovered from the property of the NAC  see s   of the Act  including the costs of the second respondent incurred as Administrator upon the appointment of the second respondent  that is a more appropriate avenue for the respondents to be protected as to the costs of the proceedings than an order against the applicants  They rely on the right under s   but do not want it exercised  They submit that the Registrar should not exercise those powers because  they contend  the exercise of them would render the NAC insolvent and lead it to being wound up  I do not know enough about the financial circumstances of the NAC  or the progress of the administration  to know whether that is the case  There is some evidence to suggest that the NAC through various business activities conducted through entities in which it had an involvement and that it had a very substantial range of assets and perhaps liabilities  I do not think that matter provides a basis for not applying the usual rule as to costs   One matter upon which the applicants sought to make submissions was based upon proposed affidavit evidence relating to the question of costs  That evidence was to show that the second respondent  despite evidence given at the hearing  had not progressed the administration with the speed at which he had said he would  and that the outcome of the administration has been regarded by the Anangu as unsatisfactory  even though it is ongoing  The respondents opposed the application to rely upon that affidavit evidence on two grounds  Firstly  that it was irrelevant to the exercise of the costs discretion in any event  And secondly  that it should not be received in its current form partly for reasons of form and partly because they would then wish to contradict it and to cross examine the deponent about it  I do not propose to receive that material  I do not think the events after the conclusion of the hearing are appropriate matters to address in relation to the exercise of the costs discretion  particularly as they are apparently contentious and would prolong the hearing  For that reason  I propose also not to receive the additional responsive affidavit upon which the second respondent putatively sought to rely citedDonald Campbell   Co v Pollack   AC   Generally  a successful respondent  in the absence of special circumstances  has a reasonable expectation of obtaining an order for the payment of costs by the applicant  However  the Court has a discretion to make no order for costs against a successful respondent if the particular circumstances warrant it  see Donald Campbell

take into account any facts connected with or leading up to the hearing which have been satisfactorily proved or which have been observed during the progress of the case  If there has been conduct on the part of the respondent such as to lead the applicant reasonably to think that he or she had a good cause of action against them  or if the respondent has engaged in misconduct in the course of and in connection with the litigation  the discretion may be exercised to make no order for costs against a successful party  I think the present circumstances  for the reasons I have given  place this

the Court also considered the principles which guide a court in exercising the discretion whether to award costs  In that case the defendant was charged with theft of a motorcar  receiving stolen goods and unlawful possession of the same goods but was acquitted  The Magistrate had refused the defendant s application for costs on the ground that the informant had acted reasonably in instituting the proceedings and that the defendant had caused suspicion to fall on him by failing to seek proof of ownership of the goods when he acquired them  Mason CJ  Toohey and McHugh JJ  Brennan and Dawson JJ dissenting  held that the Magistrate s exercise of the costs discretion had miscarried and the defendant was entitled to his costs  McHugh J at     set out the following test  Speaking generally  before a court deprives a successful defendant in summary proceedings of his or her costs  it will be necessary for the informant to establish that the defendant unreasonably induced the informant to think that a charge could be successfully bought against the defendant or that the conduct of the defendant occasioned unnecessary expense    Thus non disclosure to investigatory police of a tape recording later successfully used in cross examination of the informant s witnesses may be a relevant matter to be taken into account in determining whether the defendant should be awarded costs      A successful defendant cannot be deprived of his or her costs  however  because the charge is brought in the public interest or by a public official  because the charge is serious or because the informant acted reasonably in instituting the proceedings or might be deterred from laying charges in the future if he or she was ordered to pay costs discussedJennings v Zilahi Kis     SASR   In Jennings v Zilahi Kis     SASR     fraud proceedings were not successful  However  Bray CJ held that  even where fraud is not established  a successful defendant may be deprived of his costs by reason of circumstances leading up to and connected with the litigation  At   his Honour said  But it does mean  in my view  that I am justified in holding that the defendant company to a large extent brought this litigation upon itself  It has so enmeshed itself in conflicting obligations and ambiguous behaviour that it is not surprising that the plaintiff advisers decided to join it in this action  It could not have acted as it did  it might not have unreasonably have thought  unless it had been implicated in the original misrepresentations discussedCapolingua v Phylum Pty Ltd     WAR
