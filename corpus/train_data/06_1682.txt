Crisp v G S F Australia Pty Ltd  in the matter of Foodlife Inventory Holdings Pty Ltd  in liq    FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedMann v Carnell   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It is submitted that having disclosed particular legal advices  the inconsistency principle referred to in Mann v Carnell   HCA         CLR   has the consequence that GSF must disclose all of its communications with its solicitors  Turks  relating to the same subject matter and the same issue  namely the recovery of a debt from Foodlife by giving a statutory demand  Further  the plaintiff submitted that having deployed some of the advice in support of its defence of good faith  it would be unfair for GSF to withhold the balance of the communications  dealing with the same subject matter  from scrutiny citedBritish American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd v Cowell   VSCA         VR  http www austlii edu au au cases vic VSCA  html  GSF submitted that the advices which have been disclosed ought to be regarded as separate and distinct from the instructions that were given  and the communications that took place  in connection with or leading up to the giving of that advice  It was submitted that these other associated documents need not be considered in order to understand of the advice that has been disclosed  Further  it was submitted that documents recording instructions and the like are not to be regarded as documents that were necessary inputs into the advice that has been disclosed  Reliance was placed by GSF on the decision of the Court of Appeal in Victoria in British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd v Cowell   VSCA         VR     These submissions do not take into account the parallel principle that a party in litigation may expose its legal advice to discovery and production by making it relevant to an issue in the proceeding  In this case  by raising the defence based on s  FG   GSF has put in issue whether it acted in good faith and without suspecting insolvency when it pursued the recommended course of serving a statutory demand  Having pleaded that matter into relevance  it has effectively exposed its legal advice on that very matter to scrutiny  The position is compounded by the disclosure of some of the advice without disclosing all of the communications that took place between GSF and its solicitors citedThomason v Campbelltown Municipal Council     SR  NSW    The principle of issue waiver  which has application where a party pleads legal advice into issue and thereby imputedly waives privilege  is a long standing one  see Thomason v Campbelltown Municipal Council     SR  NSW    per Jordan CJ  The principle of issue waiver was recently considered and
