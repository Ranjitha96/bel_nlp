SZITD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedDecor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc     FCR   Because the matter was summarily dismissed by the Federal Magistrate  leave to appeal is required  In accordance with the decision in Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc     FCR   I must consider whether  in all the circumstances  the Federal Magistrate s decision is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant it being considered by the Court on appeal and  secondly  whether substantial injustice would result if leave to appeal were refused   After the matter was argued for some time on   August   I indicated that I would adjourn the hearing to today for further submissions and that if I was to give leave to appeal  I would also hear and determine the appeal at the same time  The further submissions concerned a particular issue which troubled me during the course of the first hearing  The parties were given an opportunity to consider and make further submissions on that topic  It is referred to below   The applicant is a citizen of the People s Republic of China  He was born in   and worked as a construction worker in various towns in his province until he came to Australia on   November    He applied for a protection visa under the Migration Act    Cth   the Act  shortly after that time  but his application was refused by a delegate of the first respondent on   January    That decision was then reviewed by the Refugee Review Tribunal and affirmed by that Tribunal  the first Tribunal  on   March    The first Tribunal hearing and decision was quashed by consent by order of a Federal Magistrate on   August   and remitted to the Tribunal for re hearing by that order   The Tribunal then was differently constituted  the second Tribunal   It conducted a hearing with the applicant on   December   and  as I have noted  provided its decision to the applicant on   January    It too affirmed the decision of the delegate of the first respondent not to grant to the applicant a protection visa  As I noted earlier  an application to the Federal Magistrates Court to quash the second Tribunal decision was summarily dismissed on   May     The applicant s claim to be entitled to a protection visa was based upon him claiming to be a Falun Gong practitioner  At the hearing before the first Tribunal  he said that he had become a member of Falun Gong in about May   and had progressively become more active and more senior in the Falun Gong  He promoted Falun Gong wherever he worked throughout his province  He was a senior member of Falun Gong in his province by    The Falun Gong was banned by the People s Republic of China in    The applicant claimed that in   he was arrested by the authorities and suffered  physical and mental persecution  during the four days of his detention  After his release  he continued to practice Falun Gong secretly but with a great fear of being re arrested and mistreated by the authorities citedSAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  There is one further matter which I referred to above  namely the use by the Tribunal of the recording of the hearing before the first Tribunal on   March   by the second Tribunal and its use without the applicant having been given a notice under s  A of the second Tribunal s intended reliance upon that information  I was concerned that the second Tribunal  by acting in that way  had failed to comply with the procedural prescription of s  A  see SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   citedSZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     ALR   That has been the subject of further submissions by the first respondent  I do not accept one of those submissions  It is put that the fact of inconsistency in evidence provided to the Tribunal is not itself information which activates the obligation under s  A of the Act  That is of course generally correct  So much was explained in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     ALR    However  I think that principle relates to inconsistencies which emerge in the course of a hearing and does not necessarily relate to inconsistencies which the Tribunal discerns from other information available to it  In my view  the application of that principle depends upon the Court being satisfied that the information provided at the earlier hearing before the first Tribunal was generally information before the Tribunal which did not enliven s  A at all consideredSZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC   it was decided that upon a case being remitted to the Tribunal  the Tribunal is entitled to rely upon the earlier issue of a notice under s  A and any response to a previously constituted tribunal  The Full Court at   explained in the following terms    In any event  when ss       and  A refer to   a particular review   they identify the review initiated under s   and culminating in a decision in accordance with s     being the review that a particular person  namely the applicant for review  has initiated in respect of an RRT Reviewable Decision  The expression does not depend upon the identity of the particular member constituting the Tribunal  Rather  it refers to the function of the Tribunal to review a decision  Until the Tribunal has made a valid decision on the review that has been initiated by a valid application under s     it has a duty to perform that particular review  An invalid decision by the Tribunal is no decision at all but it does not follow that all steps and procedures taken in arriving at that invalid decision are themselves invalid  The Tribunal still has before it the materials that were obtained when the decision that had been set aside was made     In essence  as I read that passage  there is but one review before the Tribunal under s   even if the Tribunal is reconstituted by its decision being quashed  The facts of that case are not identical to the present circumstances followedSZJBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  However  in SZJBE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     Emmett J addressed precisely the circumstances to which I have been referring  In that case  the Tribunal as reconstituted relied on inconsistencies with the then applicant s evidence from the first hearing at the second hearing before that reconstituted Tribunal  His Honour concluded at     that doing so did not activate s  A  That is a decision which is plainly directly on point  I should follow it unless I consider that it is plainly wrong  The applicant has not made a submission to me that it is plainly wrong  and I can readily understand the process of reasoning by which that conclusion was reached  In those circumstances I propose to follow that decision  As I regard that point as a significant and arguable one  I propose to give the applicant leave to appeal in respect of it but for the reasons which I have given I do not accept that the appeal should be allowed on that ground   I have dealt with the other matters raised by the applicant  I have found no jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal in relation to those matters  nor any error on the part of the Federal Magistrate  Accordingly I have come to the conclusion that to the extent to which leave to appeal is to be given  the appeal should be dismissed  The applicant should pay to the first respondent costs of the application   The orders of the Court are      Leave to the applicant to appeal from the decision of the Federal Magistrate given on   May   limited to the issue of whether the Tribunal  in having regard to the information provided by the applicant to the Tribunal as differently constituted at a hearing on   March   erred by failing to give to the applicant notice under s  A  of the Migration Act with respect to that information    Appeal dismissed       Applicant to pay to the first respondent costs of the application and of the appeal    I certify that the preceding
