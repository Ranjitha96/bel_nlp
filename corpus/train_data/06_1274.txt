AWB Limited v Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole  No     FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAWB Limited v Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlOn   September   I delivered reasons for judgment in this proceeding and adjourned the matter to Monday   September   for any argument as to the orders that should be made to give effect to my reasons  AWB Limited v Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole  No     FCA   at     These reasons for decision are directed to the final orders that I have determined to make  having heard submissions from the applicant and the respondents yesterday  The issues that separated the parties narrowed considerably during the course of yesterday s hearing  The remaining differences relate to the form of declaratory relief that is appropriate and the costs orders that should be made  AWB submitted that  where I have determined that documents attract privilege  wholly or partly  the Court should make a declaration to that effect  On the other hand  AWB submitted that  where I have determined that documents over which AWB claimed privilege do not attract privilege or that any privilege has been waived  I should not make a declaration to that effect  It submitted that any such declaration was unnecessary and would lack utility  Senior Counsel for AWB said  from the bar table  that the documents in question were being produced to the Commission  The relevance of this is dubious  as it follows the delivery of my reasons for judgment and  presumably  anticipates that final orders will be made that give effect to those reasons  AWB also pointed out that the Commonwealth had not mounted any cross claim for declaratory relief in its favour followedForster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe making of a declaration and the terms in which it should be framed are in the

matter of substance  the dispute that AWB submitted to the Court for its adjudication was whether legal professional privilege did  or did not  attach to the documents in AWB s further revised list of privileged documents dated   August    as supplemented by letters from AWB s solicitors to the Court dated   August   and   September    In my opinion  any declarations made by the Court should reflect the final outcome of this case with certainty and precision  Moreover  it is desirable that there should be an authoritative resolution of the dispute presented to the Court followedAinsworth

of this case with certainty and precision  Moreover  it is desirable that there should be an authoritative resolution of the dispute presented to the Court  I have concluded that the Court should make a declaration  reflecting my reasons for judgment  that legal professional privilege attaches to specified documents  and does not attach to other specified documents  Declaratory relief in this form is appropriate because it determines the legal controversy that was before the Court  see Ainsworth at   and     and Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd   HCA         CLR   at      As AWB s application makes clear  the controversy includes the question whether the documents at issue are protected from production to the Commission by legal professional privilege  This controversy is only likely to be quelled  completely and finally  by making a declaration in the form I propose appliedBass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlI have concluded

controversy is only likely to be quelled  completely and finally  by making a declaration in the form I propose consideredCretazzo v Lombardi     SASR  AWB submitted that the circumstances do not warrant any departure from the usual approach that an applicant who achieves substantial success should have the costs of the proceedings  AWB relied in particular on the following passage from Cretazzo v Lombardi     SASR      Cretazzo    where Jacobs J said at        But trials occur daily in which the party  who in the end is wholly or substantially successful  nevertheless fails along the way on particular issues of fact or law  The ultimate ends of justice may not be served if a party is dissuaded by the risk of costs from canvassing all issues  however doubtful  which might be material to the decision of the case  There are  of course  many factors affecting the exercise of the discretion as to costs in each case  including in particular  the severability of the issues  and no two cases are alike  I wish merely to lend no encouragement to any suggestion that a party against whom the judgment goes ought nevertheless to anticipate a favourable exercise of the judicial discretion as to costs in respect of issues upon which he may have succeeded  based merely on his success in those particular issues    In short  AWB submitted that it achieved substantial success and that it should have the costs of the proceeding  notwithstanding its failure on the issues of waiver and the fraud exception  The Commonwealth submitted that AWB should pay its costs of the proceedings  It argued that success in this case cannot be measured purely in numerical terms  rather a judgement ought to be made as to which party has had substantial success in the case  having regard to the significance of the issues decided by the Court in favour of one or other party  It added that a finding that privilege subsists in a large number of technical or peripheral documents cannot be weighed in the same scale  The Court s discretion to order costs under s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  is unfettered  except that it must be exercised judicially  The usual order as to costs is that a successful party will have its costs paid on a party and party basis by the unsuccessful party  Colgate Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd     FCR   at      As the passage from Cretazzo indicates  the mere fact that a substantially successful applicant fails on particular issues of fact or law along the way may not afford an adequate ground for depriving that applicant

  and Inn Leisure Industries Pty Ltd v DF McCloy Pty Ltd  No       FCR   citedDodds Family Investments Pty Ltd v Lane Industries Pty Ltd     IPR  In many cases  these principles can only be applied sensibly by taking a broad view of the results of the case and the issues that were litigated  An allocation of costs in a case of mixed results can rarely if ever be done with mathematical precision  Dodds Family Investments Pty Ltd v Lane Industries Pty Ltd     IPR   at   per Gummow  French and Hill JJ  Taking a broad and overall view of the outcome of this case  I consider that both AWB and the Commonwealth achieved a substantial measure of success  I cannot agree with AWB s submission that  in material respects  it was the successful litigant  The Commonwealth succeeded on a number of very important issues  It established that privilege did not attach to numerous documents that are likely to be material to the issues being investigated by the Commission  AWB did not merely fail  along the way  to prove particular issues of fact and law which  in the end  did not prevent it achieving substantial success  rather  AWB lost some of the most substantial issues that were litigated  Those issues involved more than half of the hearing time occupied by this case  In all the circumstances  I consider that the just and appropriate order is that there be no order as to the costs of the proceeding  The result will be that AWB and the Commonwealth must each bear its own costs  I do not consider that there is any substance in the criticisms that AWB directed towards the Commonwealth  The Commonwealth was entitled to put AWB to the proof of its privilege claims  Nor do I agree with AWB s assertion that the description of the documents in AWB s lists was generally sufficient to enable the Commonwealth to form a view about the provenance of each document and the grounds upon which privilege was claimed  AWB also sought the costs of its notice of motion dated   June   and the first respondent s notice of motion dated   July    I have concluded that there should be no order as to the costs of these notices of motion
