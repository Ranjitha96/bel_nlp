am satisfied that Naturalcare  through Schadel  did rely upon the Quality Assurance representation and the Supply representation  Counsel for Pan relied upon some factors to negative reliance  for example  the intention to source product from Amrion  the pattern of purchase from other suppliers  the freedom reserved by Schadel to acquire goods from other suppliers if price were favourable  and the variety of manufacturers Naturalcare had listed with the TGA to manufacture its products  It is submitted for Pan that the express evidence of reliance given by Schadel should be given little or no weight  citing Chappel v Hart   HCA         CLR   at   n     Chappel v Hart does not compel that conclusion  Indeed  the absence of such evidence could be fatal to a claim of reliance and causation  In the present case  Schadel s evidence accords with commercial reality  Naturalcare continued to acquire most of its goods from Pan and was lulled into what was a false sense of security by the assurances over the years and entry into the Manufacturing Agreements  It is obvious that if Schadel had thought that there was any real danger of Pan losing its licence because of non compliance with the Code  he would have taken steps to reorganise the business to minimise dependence upon Pan for supplies  In essence  Schadel was induced not to reorganise the Naturalcare business to reduce dependence upon Pan as a supplier  The misleading conduct does not have to be the sole cause of the action or inaction said to cause the damage   I   L Securities Pty Limited v HTW Valuers  Brisbane  Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   per Gleeson CJ at   per Gaudron  Gummow and Hayne JJ at   per McHugh J at     per Callinan J at      DAMAGES     The assessment of damages pursuant to s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  presents some problems  Damages have been assessed by Naturalcare by estimating the loss of gross profits on product supplied to it by Pan as at April   and then deducting from that amount any savings in costs and incidentals for a period until alternative suppliers were found  There are issues as to the particular methodology employed to arrive at that result which may be put aside for the moment  It is submitted for Pan that the basic approach is flawed  If Schadel s evidence is accepted then  on the hypothesis as to liability being explored  he would have commenced decreasing his reliance on Pan from March   both by obtaining products from a range of other suppliers and by developing more generic products rather than complex slurry mix soft gels dependent upon Pan s particular expertise  Pan complains that there has been no attempt to estimate the difference between the position that would have been arrived at as a result of that conduct and the situation which existed at the time of the recall  In other words  Naturalcare has quantified damage on the basis of the continued supply of Pan products rather than upon the hypothesis that there would have been a substitution for Pan s products  Naturalcare s claim for damages was formulated in a global fashion for all causes of action seeking to demonstrate what was lost by the inability to acquire and resell Pan products  It is submitted for Pan that this leaves the Court in a position where there is no proper basis for the assessment of damages in circumstances where a proper basis could  and should  have been put forward   Placer  Granny Smith  Pty Ltd v Thiess Contractors Pty Ltd   HCA         ALR   at   per Hayne J  Optus Vision Pty Limited v Australian Rugby Football League Limited   NSWSC   at      unaffected by the appeal at   NSWCA    Naturalcare responds that the approach that it has taken is likely to underestimate the quantum of potential damages as it does not take into account the fact that if it had reorganised its business it would have been in a stronger position in the market following the Pan recall than it ultimately was as its competitors would have been adversely affected by the recall and it would not have been  It  therefore  would have been likely to have increased its market share  It is also submitted that the method chosen uses actual figures and so reduces the necessity for hypothetical estimates which would inevitably be speculative  In my opinion  the approach taken by Naturalcare is acceptable as a starting point   Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at      As it was induced to do nothing  it did not get out of the way and was a sitting duck when hit by the runaway train  Quantification of the effects of the train wreck is a good starting point for the assessment of loss  Of necessity  the assessment of damages in a case such as this is imprecise  There is a body of material in evidence as to the financial performance of the Naturalcare business prior to and after the suspension of licence and product recall which forms the raw material for the necessary assessment  The fact that the witnesses have approached the matter in one way or another is not decisive  If reorganisation of the business could have been completed so as to eliminate dependence upon Pan prior to the suspension of Pan s licence  then the proposed measure of damages would be a good proxy for the loss caused by the misleading and deceptive conduct  If reorganisation would not have been completed  there would need to be a discount to reflect the extent to which reorganisation would not have taken place  The evidence of what occurred in relation to reorganisation after the recall is of some value in assessing what may have occurred in the   months prior to it  However  the latter period was complicated by widespread effect of the failure of Pan  which meant that many other customers apart from Naturalcare were scrambling to obtain supply  I am not satisfied that the divorce from Pan would have been complete by the time of the suspension of the licence  even if commenced in March    I agree with the submission by counsel for Naturalcare that the most striking aspect of the actual results post recall is the significant loss of total revenue by the business after the cessation of supply by Pan  The total revenue for the period   May   to   April   was       with an average monthly revenue of      In the period from   May   to   April   the total revenue was       with an average monthly revenue of      In the period from   May   to   April   the total revenue was       with an average monthly revenue of      In the period from   May   to   April   the total revenue was       with an average monthly revenue of      Thus  in what is roughly the year after the cessation of supply  the decrease in total revenue was       and in the ensuing   months the decrease was     in total which together can be rounded up to about        This pattern is broadly consistent with the evidence given as to the replacement of individual Pan products over the period  No other substantive reason has been advanced for the drop in revenue apart from the disturbance of supply of Pan products  I am satisfied that the interruption of supply was progressively alleviated over approximately two years  The total lost revenue in the two years would  as submitted by counsel for Naturalcare  understate the true loss as revenue had been on a rising plane up to the time of termination of supply by Pan  No doubt some of the effect of the unavailability of Pan products upon Naturalcare was due to Markethaven being unable to supply Pan products  It is reasonable to take account of that consequence because of the history of the relationship between Pan  Markethaven and Naturalcare  Pan endeavoured to establish that Naturalcare had not taken reasonable or timely steps to obtain substituted supplies more quickly  There was an attempt to use cross examination and some evidence to show that Naturalcare had not acted reasonably as there were sources of supply not examined at all or not examined promptly  In my opinion  that endeavour was unsuccessful  Naturalcare had every commercial reason to take all steps open to it to minimise the loss  There is no reason to doubt the motivation to do so  In assessing the situation it is necessary to bear in mind what was said by Lord Macmillan in the well known passage from Banco de Portugal v Waterlow   Sons Ltd   UKHL       AC    at        It is often easy after an emergency has passed to criticize the steps which have been taken to meet it  but such criticism does not come well from those who have themselves created the emergency  The law is satisfied if the party placed in a difficult situation by reason of the breach of a duty owed to him has acted reasonably in the adoption of remedial measures  and he will not be held disentitled to recover the cost of such measures merely because the party in breach can suggest that other measures less burdensome to him might have been taken      It is also necessary to bear in mind that Schadel s reliance on Selim had limited his knowledge of the market  Even if the result was not perfect  I am satisfied that Naturalcare took reasonable steps to restore supply     Loss of gross revenue is not the measure of loss to the business  It is quite obvious  however  that a sudden loss of revenue by a continuing business will inevitably lead to a net loss  Fixed costs and many of the variable costs will remain  There was a good deal of attention in the evidence and in the submissions to assessing the net revenue lost  In my opinion  the endeavour by Naturalcare to found upon a gross profit margin applicable only to the goods supplied by Pan is not appropriate to an exercise to determine damages for breach of s    I am satisfied that  in this respect  it is appropriate to adopt a margin of   per cent in accordance with the opinion of Mr McGuiness  However  having studied his report  and taking into account his evidence under cross examination  his assessment of MSD costs and other operating expenses and the saving of wages costs are all too high  In my opinion  they should be approximately   per cent in total  rather than   per cent as he proposed  Therefore  in broad terms  the loss of net revenue is calculated as follows  loss of revenue       x gross profit margin   per cent         less costs etc x   per cent       leaving net revenue of        Allowance then needs to be made for the overlap between that amount and the loss of profit on goods returned and goods ordered but not supplied  Then there should be some discount for the uncertainty as to whether the business would have been completely reorganised by the time of the licence suspension and for other uncertainties  The principal difference between the parties in relation to the goods returned and goods not supplied claim relates to the gross profit margin  Naturalcare claims a gross margin of     per cent for goods sourced from Pan moderated to     per cent if freight is taken into account  In my opinion  the criticisms of the foundation for that claim made by McGuiness are valid  I prefer to adopt for those purposes the yardsticks I have adopted for the umbrella claim  ie gross margin of   per cent and MSD etc of   per cent  The amount which is to be allowed for loss of profits on those claims is to be deducted from the overall amount I found for net loss  I would then discount the net amount by   per cent to take account of the uncertainties to which I have referred  I do not see the necessity for any discount back to a present value at the date of breach  The time has now elapsed  The amounts in question reflect the dollar values at the time during the period of loss  On that basis  interest would not run from the date of breach but should be calculated to reflect the progressive occurrence of loss  The amount of judgment should also reflect amounts allowed for direct expenses incurred due to the disruption such as the packaging  costs of registration and so on  Unless there are special reasons to the contrary  costs should follow the event  The proceeding will stand over to enable counsel for Naturalcare to bring in draft orders to reflect these reasons  including calculation of the amounts for damages and interest  The parties should also draw my attention to any issue that has been overlooked    I certify that the preceding

Central Qld  Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlNaturalcare relies upon two representations  The first is that Pan would so conduct its manufacturing processes as to comply with the Code called the Quality Assurance representation  This representation is alleged to have been made by the   Manufacturing Agreement in the light of previous dealings between the parties  Contractual promises can be the foundation of misleading and deceptive conduct for the purposes of s   in some circumstances   HTW Valuers  Central Qld  Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at      Whether these are such circumstances is best judged in a wider context  It is also alleged  further or in the alternative  that Pan represented to Naturalcare that Pan would continue to supply all  or most of  Naturalcare s requirements as to therapeutic goods or  alternatively  Naturalcare s requirements as to soft gel goods and all or most of Naturalcare s requirements as to other therapeutic goods called the Supply representation  That alleged representation is based upon particular statements in various discussions between Schadel and Selim including that Pan was the largest manufacturer of health care products in Australia and was compliant with the requirements of the TGA and  accordingly  that the risk associated with Naturalcare s reliance and dependence on Pan continuing to supply Naturalcare with those goods customarily purchased by it from Pan at the quantities customarily acquired was negligible or immaterial  and that Pan was ready  willing and able to continue to supply Naturalcare with all goods it customarily acquired from Pan at those quantities it customarily obtained from Pan  It is submitted on behalf of Naturalcare that each of the Quality Assurance representation and the Supply representation was with respect to a future matter  in the one case  future conduct of the manufacturing process  and the other  the future ability to supply therapeutic goods  each broadly concerned with the continuing supply of therapeutic goods  It is contended that Pan has not established reasonable grounds for making either representation  with the result that the making of each of them was misleading and deceptive  or likely to mislead and deceive  It is further contended that Naturalcare relied upon the misleading conduct by continuing to conduct business on the basis that the bulk of the products it was to sell would be acquired from Pan and did not reorganise its business  This left it vulnerable to the sudden cessation of supply which occurred upon suspension of Pan s licence  leading to losses due to the disruption to its business  The question is whether entering into the Manufacturing Agreement in   in the light of the previous dealings amounted to a representation or representations as pleaded and not whether a contractual promise was made  Reference has already been

the TGA to manufacture its products  It is submitted for Pan that the express evidence of reliance given by Schadel should be given little or no weight  citing Chappel v Hart   HCA         CLR   at

Gaudron  Gummow and Hayne JJ at   per McHugh J at     per Callinan J at      DAMAGES     The assessment of damages pursuant to s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  presents some problems  Damages have been assessed by Naturalcare by estimating the loss of gross profits on product supplied to it by Pan as at April   and then deducting from that amount any savings in costs and incidentals for a period until alternative suppliers were found  There are issues as to the particular methodology employed to arrive at that result which may be put aside for the moment  It is submitted for Pan that the basic approach is flawed  If Schadel s evidence is accepted then  on the hypothesis as to liability being explored  he would have commenced decreasing his reliance on Pan from March   both by obtaining products from a range of other suppliers and by developing more generic products rather than complex slurry mix soft gels dependent upon Pan s particular expertise  Pan complains that there has been no attempt to estimate the difference between the position that would have been arrived at as a result of that conduct and the situation which existed at the time of the recall  In other words  Naturalcare has quantified damage on the basis of the continued supply of Pan products rather than upon the hypothesis that there would have been a substitution for Pan s products  Naturalcare s claim for damages was formulated in a global fashion for all causes of action seeking to demonstrate what was lost by the inability to acquire and resell Pan products  It is submitted for Pan that this leaves the Court in a position where there is no proper basis for the assessment of damages in circumstances where a proper basis could  and should  have been put forward   Placer  Granny Smith

Naturalcare responds that the approach that it has taken is likely to underestimate the quantum of potential damages as it does not take into account the fact that if it had reorganised its business it would have been in a stronger position in the market following the Pan recall than it ultimately was as its competitors would have been adversely affected by the recall and it would not have been  It  therefore  would have been likely to have increased its market share  It is also submitted that the method chosen uses actual figures and so reduces the necessity for hypothetical estimates which would inevitably be speculative  In my opinion  the approach taken by Naturalcare is acceptable as a starting point   Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at      As it was induced to do nothing  it did not get out of the way and was a sitting duck when hit by the runaway train  Quantification of the effects of the train wreck is a good starting point for the assessment of loss  Of necessity  the assessment of damages in a case such as this is imprecise  There is a body of material in evidence as to the financial performance of the Naturalcare business prior to and after the suspension of licence and product recall which forms the raw material for the necessary assessment  The fact that the witnesses have approached the matter in one way or another is not decisive  If reorganisation of the business could have been completed so as to eliminate dependence upon Pan prior to the suspension of Pan s licence  then the proposed measure of damages would be a good proxy for the loss caused by the misleading and deceptive conduct  If reorganisation would not have been completed  there would need to be a discount to reflect the extent to which reorganisation would not have taken place  The evidence of what occurred in relation to reorganisation after the recall is of some value in assessing what may have occurred in the   months prior to it  However  the latter period was complicated by widespread effect of the failure of Pan  which meant that many other customers apart from Naturalcare were scrambling to obtain supply  I am not satisfied that the divorce from Pan would have been complete by the time of the suspension of the licence  even if commenced in March    I agree with the submission by counsel for Naturalcare that the most striking aspect of the actual results post recall is the significant loss of total revenue by the business after the cessation of supply by Pan  The total revenue for the period   May   to   April   was       with an average monthly revenue of      In the period from   May   to   April   the total revenue was       with an average monthly revenue of      In the period from   May   to   April   the total revenue was       with an average monthly revenue of      In the period from   May   to   April   the total revenue was       with an average monthly revenue of      Thus  in what is roughly the year after the cessation of supply  the decrease in total revenue was       and in the ensuing   months the decrease was     in total which together can be rounded up to about        This pattern is broadly consistent with the evidence given as to the replacement of individual Pan products over the period  No other substantive reason has been advanced for the drop in revenue apart from the disturbance of supply of Pan products  I am satisfied that the interruption of supply was progressively alleviated over approximately two years  The total lost revenue in the two years would  as submitted by counsel for Naturalcare  understate the true loss as revenue had been on a rising plane up to the time of termination of supply by Pan  No doubt some of the effect of the unavailability of Pan products upon Naturalcare was due to Markethaven being unable to supply Pan products  It is reasonable to take account of that consequence because of the history of the relationship between Pan  Markethaven and Naturalcare  Pan endeavoured to establish that Naturalcare had not taken reasonable or timely steps to obtain substituted supplies more quickly  There was an attempt to use cross examination and some evidence to show that Naturalcare had not acted reasonably as there were sources of supply not examined at all or not examined promptly  In my opinion  that endeavour was unsuccessful  Naturalcare had every commercial reason to take all steps open to it to minimise the loss  There is no reason to doubt the motivation to do so  In assessing the situation it is necessary to bear in mind what was said by Lord Macmillan in the well known passage from Banco de Portugal v Waterlow   Sons Ltd   UKHL       AC    at        It is often easy after an emergency has passed to criticize the steps which have been taken to meet it  but such criticism does not come well from those who have themselves created the emergency  The law is satisfied if the party placed in a difficult situation by reason of the breach of a duty owed to him has acted reasonably in the adoption of remedial measures  and he will not be held disentitled to recover the cost of such measures merely because the party in breach can suggest that other measures less burdensome to him might have been taken      It is also necessary to bear in mind that Schadel s reliance on Selim had limited his knowledge of the market  Even if the result was not perfect  I am satisfied that Naturalcare took reasonable steps to restore supply     Loss of gross revenue is not the measure of loss to the business  It is quite obvious  however  that a sudden loss of revenue by a continuing business will inevitably lead to a net loss  Fixed costs and many of the variable costs will remain  There was a good deal of attention in the evidence and in the submissions to assessing the net revenue lost  In my opinion  the endeavour by Naturalcare to found upon a gross profit margin applicable only to the goods supplied by Pan is not appropriate to an exercise to determine damages for breach of s    I am satisfied that  in this respect  it is appropriate to adopt a margin of   per cent in accordance with the opinion of Mr McGuiness  However  having studied his report  and taking into account his evidence under cross examination  his assessment of MSD costs and other operating expenses and the saving of wages costs are all too high  In my opinion  they should be approximately   per cent in total  rather than   per cent as he proposed  Therefore  in broad terms  the loss of net revenue is calculated as follows  loss of revenue       x gross profit margin   per cent         less costs etc x   per cent       leaving net revenue of        Allowance then needs to be made for the overlap between that amount and the loss of profit on goods returned and goods ordered but not supplied  Then there should be some discount for the uncertainty as to whether the business would have been completely reorganised by the time of the licence suspension and for other uncertainties  The principal difference between the parties in relation to the goods returned and goods not supplied claim relates to the gross profit margin  Naturalcare claims a gross margin of     per cent for goods sourced from Pan moderated to     per cent if freight is taken into account  In my opinion  the criticisms of the foundation for that claim made by McGuiness are valid  I prefer to adopt for those purposes the yardsticks I have adopted for the umbrella claim  ie gross margin of   per cent and MSD etc of   per cent  The amount which is to be allowed for loss of profits on those claims is to be deducted from the overall amount I found for net loss  I would then discount the net amount by   per cent to take account of the uncertainties to which I have referred  I do not see the necessity for any discount back to a present value at the date of breach  The time has now elapsed  The amounts in question reflect the dollar values at the time during the period of loss  On that basis  interest would not run from the date of breach but should be calculated to reflect the progressive occurrence of loss  The amount of judgment should also reflect amounts allowed for direct expenses incurred due to the disruption such as the packaging  costs of registration and so on  Unless there are special reasons to the contrary  costs should follow the event  The proceeding will stand over to enable counsel for Naturalcare to bring in draft orders to reflect these reasons  including calculation of the amounts for damages and interest  The parties should also draw my attention to any issue that has been overlooked    I certify that the preceding one hundred and six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein

standard categories in which the common law has previously recognised that a duty of care may arise  namely  the negligent supply of goods   Perre v Apand Pty Limited at   per McHugh J       The policy consideration relating to indeterminacy of liability does not arise in the present case  Naturalcare was a first line victim      Imposing a duty of care of the kind alleged would not impose an unreasonable burden on Pan   Perre v Apand Pty Limited at   per McHugh J    Taking these factors into account  it was submitted that Pan had a duty of care at least to take reasonable care to ensure that the goods it manufactured for supply conformed with the requirements of the TGA and the Code  Counsel for Pan has put forward a number of detailed reasons for its contention that the claim is misconceived  The most important is that Naturalcare was not  vulnerable  in the sense required if that quality is to be a touchstone of liability as was submitted on behalf of Naturalcare  It would be necessary for Naturalcare to establish that it could not protect itself from the consequences of Pan s want of reasonable care  either entirely or at least in a way which would cast the consequences of the loss on the other party   Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd at   per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Heydon JJ  and Perre v Apand Pty Ltd per McHugh J at    The risk of a supplier of goods not being able to maintain supply is an every day incident of commercial life  Many statutes regulate manufacturers and suppliers of goods  There is always a risk that if the statute is not complied with  the supply of goods may be prohibited or suspended  Various strategies to minimise risks of that kind and their impact are available to the intending purchaser  Particular contractual provisions can be framed  insurance can be sought  alternative suppliers located and so on  All available strategies were open to Naturalcare  The answer given on behalf of Naturalcare is that it was convinced by Selim s assurances not to take such prudent steps  That is no answer  It highlights the fact that the real complaint is about the alleged representations  not about failure to take reasonable care to ensure that the requirements of the Code were met discussedWaltons Stores  Interstate  Limited v Maher   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth

agreed to by Tobias JA at    Counsel for Pan submits that this claim is misconceived and that equitable estoppel can not be used as a sword otherwise than in equity  Counsel submits that Waltons Stores  Interstate  Ltd v Maher does not establish that equitable estoppel is a cause of action in itself capable of sounding in damages  legal or equitable  although it may assist in establishing a recognised cause of action such as breach of contract  as in that case   There is much to be said for that submission  However  the question is controversial  KR Handley  Estoppel by Conduct and Election  Sweet   Maxwell  London    Ch    As I have a clear view that the integers of promissory estoppel are not established  I need not deal further with this fundamental question  It should be noted that the claim for estoppel by convention is not pursued  The estoppel case pleads the assumption that Pan was  and would continue to be  the exclusive supplier of soft gel goods and the supplier of the whole or the majority of the other therapeutic goods sold by Naturalcare for at least the term of the Manufacturing Agreement  including any renewed term  The case pleads an expectation by Naturalcare that Pan would continue to be its exclusive supplier of soft gel goods and the supplier of the whole or the majority of the other therapeutic goods sold by Naturalcare and that Pan would not be free to  or would not  withdraw from that expected relationship for at least the term of the Manufacturing Agreement  including any renewed term  That assumption and that expectation are said to have arisen from the same course of conduct as was alleged to have given rise to the Supply Contract  together with some allegations of a general kind as to the relationship between the parties  also relied upon to establish a duty of care  Counsel for Naturalcare referred  in particular  to parts of a conversation between Schadel  Davis and Selim  which took place in    The next problem is in identifying an appropriate subject matter for the assumption or expectation  Counsel for Naturalcare referred to the passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons Stores  Interstate  Ltd v Maher where his Honour said  amongst other things  at            the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and  in the latter case  that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship     Mason CJ and Wilson J referred to  basic assumptions underlying the transaction between the parties   at    They went on to point out that the failure to fulfil a promise does not  of itself  amount to unconscionable conduct and mere reliance upon an executory promise to do something does not bring promissory estoppel into play  also at    It is submitted by counsel for Naturalcare that the legal relationship in question was as supplier of Naturalcare s soft gel business and of the majority of Naturalcare s tablet business  In my opinion  that does not amount to a relevant assumption or expectation  It only illustrates a continuing commercial relationship  The next problem is that Naturalcare has to establish that the estoppel in the terms alleged was operative in    I have no difficulty in rejecting that contention  Such an assumption would be inconsistent with the course of dealings between the parties up to that time  Naturalcare had acquired soft gel products from non Pan sources and the majority of tablets from non Pan sources  Counsel for Naturalcare was only able to argue that Naturalcare gave Pan almost all of its soft gel business between January   and April   being   per cent by value and     per cent of its tablet products by value and Naturalcare acquired     per cent of its tablet products  by value  from Pan in the period January   to April   rather than     per cent but only if Healthy Joints figures are excluded  Next  it is not at all clear how it is alleged that the assumption and expectation were unconscientiously departed from  The failure to supply products was not the kind of deliberate unconscientious departure from a state of affairs which might found a promissory estoppel  It was the result of action by the TGA pursuant to statute citedWright v TNT Management Pty Ltd     NSWLR  The question is whether entering into the Manufacturing Agreement in   in the light of the previous dealings amounted to a representation or representations as pleaded and not whether a contractual promise was made  Reference has already been made to the judgment of Gleeson CJ  McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Heydon JJ in HTW Valuers  Central Qld  Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd   dealing with the capacity of contractual promises to found representations for the purposes of s   which in turn refers to the judgment of Lockhart and Gummow JJ in Accounting Systems    Developments  Pty Ltd v CCH Australia Ltd     FCR   at      see also Futuretronics International Pty Ltd v Gadzhis     VR   at      A practical example of the interplay between contractual promises and misleading or deceptive conduct is seen in the decision of Finn J in Hughes Aircraft Systems International v Airservices Australia     FCR    Nonetheless  some caution needs
