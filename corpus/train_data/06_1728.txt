cth HCA  html  Keddies characterises Mr Woodgate s contentions as to the costs agreement as a submission that a term should be implied into the costs agreement that the moneys would be refunded if the verdict were set aside on appeal  Mr Woodgate rejected the assertion that his case relies on any implied term and the Court did not have the benefit of substantive submissions on this point  While an implied term requiring moneys to be repaid if a verdict were set aside is capable of clear expression and would arguably be reasonable and equitable in circumstances where a verdict in the District Court might later be overturned  it has not been established by Mr Woodgate that the remaining criteria for an implied term are satisfied   Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of NSW

Australia   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Even if there were a mistake  if Keddies had adversely changed their position in reliance on the payment and honestly believed that they were entitled to receive and retain the moneys  they submit they have a defence to the claim   David Securities Pty Limited v Commonwealth Bank of Australia   HCA         CLR    In the present case  it is not suggested that Keddies had other than an honest belief in their entitlement to payment  Keddies submit that  following David Securities   restitution at the hands of Mrs McGuiness  or her trustee  is unavailable   Keddies rely on the payment made pursuant to the authority as follows      They have changed their position between the verdict in the District Court and the allowance of the appeal      That change in position was in reliance on the authority      They acted in reliance on the authority and acted to their detriment in satisfying third party expenses without a right of recovery  They also acted in reliance on the authority in disbursing their own profit costs      It would be inequitable in all the circumstances to require restitution  Those circumstances include the absence of any demand or assertion of obligation to repay by Mrs McGuiness or the estate prior to the demand by the trustee and the absence of any allegation of want of good faith on the part of Keddies   In David Securities the High Court said that the fact that a payment has been caused by a mistake is sufficient to give rise to a prima facie obligation on the part of the recipient to make restitution  at    The recipient has a defence if he or she can show that an order for restitution is unjust  One example is a change of position by acting to the recipient s detriment on the faith of the receipt of the moneys  at     It is conceded that Mrs McGuiness had a legal obligation to pay and Keddies a right to receive the moneys after the District Court verdict and before the appeal was filed  There is no direct evidence of her belief at the relevant time and the onus is on her trustee to establish the nature of her intent if he wishes to claim restitution  The mere fact that Keddies required payment to be made does not  of itself  warrant the drawing of the required inference   David Securities at    Accordingly  category   does not apply  In light of the acknowledgment by Mrs McGuiness that an appeal was possible and that she might be ordered to repay the monies  absent further evidence  category   or   applies  For the reasons discussed in David Securities and as discussed by Mason and Carter at   the payment was voluntary and Mr Woodgate can not recover the moneys on behalf of the estate   As I have noted  clause   of the costs agreement drew a distinction between certain types of disbursements  The effect of the clause was to provide that      Mrs McGuiness was obliged in any event to pay expenses listed in clause  b   Those expenses were set out in clause  i  and  ii  the letter  b  having been omitted due to an apparent typographical error  and were medical report fees and court filing fees      apart from the expenses in  b    all other charges and expenses which are payable only on the successful outcome of the Work will be given to you after completion of the Work     Mr Woodgate submits that despite clause   Keddies are liable to reimburse moneys paid out for clause  i  and  ii   It is fair to say  however  that this is not the mainstay of his submissions   Even if that money was paid by Mrs McGuiness under a misapprehension as to her obligation to pay at that time or under the mistaken belief that the moneys would be returned if an appeal were successful and even though the verdict was set aside  Keddies are not obliged to refund the moneys to Mrs McGuiness  estate  They paid out the moneys in accordance with their client s direction and  accordingly  changed their position   David Securities at     Medical report and court filing fees were not subject to any contingency  Mrs McGuiness was liable to pay those costs in any event   Mr Woodgate has not established any legal basis for the estate s entitlement to repayment  The application should be dismissed with costs   I certify that the preceding forty nine   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the

labouring under a mistake when she authorised the payment to Keddies  She acknowledged that there may be an appeal and that she may be unsuccessful and may be required to repay the moneys  cf Hookway v Racing Victoria Limited   VSCA   at      Her payment was a voluntary payment  The consequence of that payment was that the costs agreement was brought to an end  The condition precedent under the contract did exist at that time   Mason K and Carter JW   Restitution Law in Australia  Butterworths    at   discuss the situation where a person pays to another moneys apparently due under a contract where the person        has a conscious but mistaken understanding of the payer s legal obligation to pay or the payee s legal right to receive the money            intends to settle a claim honestly

parties  The RTA could not have obtained a refund from Keddies after it succeeded on appeal whether the costs agreement was conditional or unconditional   Mr Woodgate contends  however  that Mrs McGuiness  obligations were avoided after the successful appeal by the RTA  He emphasises that  had there been a verdict for the RTA in the District Court  Mrs McGuiness would not have been liable to
