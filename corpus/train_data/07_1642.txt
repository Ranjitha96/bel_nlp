motion  compare Begg v Cooper     LT   and Carlton and United Breweries Ltd v Long   VR   at     per Smith J  Subject to one matter  I consider this power should be exercised in the applicant s favour  The affidavits do not alter the essential case the respondents were to meet on this summary judgment application  On one view  the respondents were entitled to summary judgment without them  The effect of the affidavits is simply to overcome two potential minor deficiencies in the applicants  supporting material  These deficiencies were clearly capable of being met by the applicants  Had they sought leave at the hearing on   October   to file this further material  I would have granted it  I can see no good reason to deny them leave now citedCarlton and United Breweries Ltd v Long   VR   I

federal ct  html  Finally  as noted above  the respondents have not pleaded reliance on s   of the   Act in their Amended Defence  That is  they have not sought positively to assert that the counterfeit goods were not counterfeit because the marks in question were applied with the consent of the registered owner  Had they done so  then it would have been incumbent on them to make out their case  see Brother Industries  Ltd v Dynamic Supplies Pty Ltd   FCA   at   per Tamberlin J  As things stand  even if they had relied on s     in the absence of evidence tending to support this assertion  there would be no reason to believe that they had any reasonable prospect of succeeding on a s   defence   In these circumstances  there is nothing to be gained from adjourning this motion to permit the respondents to have a subpoena issued to Mr Duong  The respondents have not presented any evidence that would indicate that he could give relevant evidence concerning the issue of authorisation  They have not proposed in argument how he could give any such evidence  On the face of it  it seems most unlikely that he could assist the respondents at all on this question  especially when the evidence of Mr Shepherd is borne in mind appliedNokia Corporation v Truong   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In written submissions filed with leave after the hearing  counsel for the respondents submitted that s   was not  a defence  in the strict sense  Instead  s   reduced the ambit of s    It was unnecessary  so counsel said  for the respondents to plead s   expressly as a defence  Even if this were so  it would not affect the outcome of the applicants  summary judgment motion  Let it be assumed that the Amended Defence positively asserted that the marks on the goods in question were applied with the registered owner s consent and the goods were not counterfeit  The respondents placed no evidence before the Court that tended to support this assertion  see Nokia Corporation v Truong   FCA   at   per Crennan J  Nor did they place any evidence before the Court that they had any such evidence available to them   The pleadings and the evidence lead me to conclude that the first respondent has no reasonable prospects of defending the applicants  trade mark infringement claim   Accordingly  providing the applicants file and serve the duly affirmed affidavits of Mr Shepherd and Ms Limpipat today  I would order summary judgment be entered on the trade mark infringement claim against the first respondent  Rosa Dora  I propose to adjourn the matter to enable the parties to prepare draft minutes of order to give effect to these reasons
