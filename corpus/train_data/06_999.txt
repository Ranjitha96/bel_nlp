cases cth HCA  htmlWhile what happened in the verification of the petition could in one sense be said to be a formal defect or irregularity for the purpose of s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  the conduct of Wright Designed in this litigation would negate any beneficial exercise of the discretion which I have to validate its conduct  cp  Adams v Lambert   HCA         ALR   at           per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne  Callinan  Heydon and Crennan JJ   However  I do not think that this is a case in which the proceedings have been invalidated by the defect  The authorities show that the defect could be cured by an amendment pursuant to s  b  of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   The question is whether or not the petitioning creditor which has not been prepared to comply with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  so as to make available to creditors generally its security if required by the trustee in bankruptcy should be allowed to proceed to obtain a sequestration order while retaining the benefit of its security  No offer has been made to make the security so available  nor was any application to amend made  I have also considered whether to afford Wright Designed an opportunity to apply for an amendment  Having regard to the way the hearing was conducted and to the findings which I have made above  it would not be fair to do so  If Wright Designed  which was legally represented  could amend and reopen  then  in the interests of justice  Mr and Mrs McClymont could also seek to do so to supplement their evidence on solvency  This would render the above reasons and the hearing otiose  The parties chose to conduct the proceedings on the issues which were contested  I am of opinion that it would not be in the interests of justice or fair to grant to Wright Designed  at this late stage  an opportunity to amend its defective creditor s petition and evidence appliedBarry v Heider   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA

failure by a petitioner to fully describe the act of bankruptcy referred to in s  g  in his petition  consideredHall v Richards   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThat was a clear and unequivocal claim of a charge of the kind which s  D  of the Home Building Act    NSW  specifically contemplated could be made after judgment had been made by the Local Court  However before me  Mr Cohen argued that in consequence of the fact that the debtors had caused the issue of a lapsing notice for the caveat which resulted in the caveat being removed from the title to their unit  the charge had somehow disappeared  No authority was cited for the proposition  That was unsurprising  it is unarguable  As Kitto J  with whom Dixon CJ and Windeyer J agreed  said in Hall v Richards   HCA         CLR   at   in the context of considering whether a person entitled to a judgment debt was a secured creditor for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth      legal effect of the caveat  as has often been said of caveats under the ordinary caveat provisions of Torrens legislation  was that of a statutory injunction  serving merely to keep property available in case the judgment creditor should wish to have execution against it  and it is clear on the authorities abovementioned that to apply the term   lien  or even the term   charge  to anything which has no greater effect than that is to depart from the terminology of the Bankruptcy Act  Mr Green s verification of the petition and his instructions to lodge the caveat were based on Mr Cohen s advice that the judgment may have created a caveatable interest  That was  in essence  correct because cl   operated only when s  D  of the Home Building Act    NSW  permitted such an interest in land  namely the equitable mortgage  to come into existence which occurred once the Local Court or the tribunal had made an order for payment in favour of Wright Designed  But  contrary to Mr Green s and Mr Cohen s misunderstanding  the caveat did not create any equitable or other interest in land it simply sought to protect the interest which cl   created once the Local Court or tribunal had made the order for payment  Next  Mr Cohen argued that the charge provided for in the contracts did not create an equitable estate or interest in the land because it did not meet the definition of  charge  in s   of the Real Property Act    NSW   That provided  relevantly that a charge meant  any charge on land created for the purposes of securing the payment of an annuity  rent charge or sum of money other than a debt   This  he argued  meant that the judgment or order on which the petition was founded and the other judgment amount owing to Wright Designed each constituted a debt with the result that  whatever cl   did  it did not create a  charge  for the purpose of the Real Property Act    NSW   However  a  mortgage  is defined in s   of the same Act as  any charge on land  other than a covenant charge  created merely for the securing the payment of a debt   Charge  in the definition of  secured creditor  in the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  has a wide connotation  cf Hall v Richards   HCA         CLR   at    It refers to a relationship which gives the chargee positive rights over the property of the chargor   CLR at    It is clear that cl   created an obligation  enforceable in equity  against the McClymonts to execute a mortgage in registrable form so as to give effect to the equitable mortgage referred to in cl    A court of equity could enforce that obligation  absent some unconscientious conduct on the part of Wright Designed  and no reason has been put why it would not do so citedHarvey v Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlI am of opinion that s   does not permit Wright Designed to claim falsely in the petition that it holds no security and  if that is proved wrong  to turn around and say that it could present the petition anyway without having voluntarily offered  under s     to surrender the security for the benefit of creditors generally  Such a construction of s   reflects the principle of bankruptcy law that all unsecured creditors should be treated equally and a secured creditor should not be allowed to prove for its full debt as an unsecured creditor as well as keeping its security  see Harvey v Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     per Dixon J with whom Rich J agreed at   see too per Starke J at    Wright Designed was a secured creditor  It incorrectly caused the petition to be verified without complying with s    It was well aware of the provisions of the contract entitling it to security  for it lodged a caveat making a claim that it had an interest in Mr and Mrs McClymont s home unit at Killara  The caveat lapsed after they caused a lapsing notice to be issued under the provisions of the Real Property Act    NSW   The holder of an equitable mortgage

http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  htmlWright Designed issued a bankruptcy notice seeking payment of the then outstanding Local Court judgment debt of      The bankruptcy notice was served on Mr and Mrs McClymont on   November    They applied to the Federal Magistrates Court to set it aside  On   January   that court dismissed the application in consequence of which an act of bankruptcy was committed on that day by each of Mr and Mrs McClymont   McClymont v Wright Designed Pty Limited   FMCA    Each of Mr and Mrs McClymont had a dwelling house in Australia  namely their home unit  at the time when the act of bankruptcy was committed  Each of Mr and Mrs McClymont was served subsequently with a creditor s petition which relied on the act of bankruptcy  Mr McClymont appeared on behalf of himself and his wife  They oppose the making of sequestration orders on the following grounds   a  the petition incorrectly alleged that Wright Designed did not hold security over their property   b  they are solvent   c  they had sufficient cause to object against payment of the judgment debts due to Wright Designed or its authorized agents   d  the affidavits verifying the petition were not sworn by a person who knew the relevant facts approvedMontagu v The Earl of Sandwich     Ch D  In Re Roberts  Ex parte Australian Telecom Employees Credit Co operative Limited     FLR   Sweeney J held that a loan contract which provided that the borrower should execute an equitable charge in favour of the lender over the relevant real property and agreed to the lodging of a caveat to protect that interest  created a security in favour of the creditor  He said that the debtor having executed the agreement and accepted the loan pursuant to it had done everything needed to entitle the creditor to require him to execute an equitable charge in a form chosen by the creditor  He referred to Montagu v The Earl of Sandwich     Ch D   at     per Cotton LJ  His Honour held that the loan agreement itself constituted a charge over the interest of the debtor in the relevant real property and that the holder of such a charge was a secured creditor within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   His Honour s analysis is in my opinion correct and can be applied to the present case discussedRe A Debtor     Ch  In Re A Debtor     Ch   at   Lord Greene MR  with whom MacKinnon and Goddard LJJ agreed  said that it was true that in a case of inadvertence or of some reasonable excuse  the Court had jurisdiction to allow an amendment to enable compliance with the provisions of the English bankruptcy legislation  requiring a petitioning creditor to set out the fact and value of its security in the petition  His Lordship said at   in refusing to allow an amendment      was no inadvertence here  and no mistake of fact  On the other hand  there has been a deliberate attempt by the petitioning creditor throughout to maintain the position that he holds no security and is entitled to disregard the shares  which were the security    I do not suggest that there has been any bad faith about that  He held  no doubt  a genuine belief that that was the legal position  but  in view of what I consider to be a very unfair attitude  I do not think we ought to allow an amendment  The position of Wright Designed in the present circumstances is not as clear in relation to its good faith  The verification of the grounds supporting the caveat are in flat contradiction to the verification of the petition  The arguments put forward by Wright Designed in support of its position that it is an unsecured creditor are  in my view  untenable  However  I am mindful of the fact that there is an unsecured creditor  Mr Wright  and of the fact that the McClymonts have not paid that judgment debt  Moreover  there is a public interest in the Court protecting the public generally against insolvents continuing to incur liabilities  But the purpose of ss       and   is that a secured creditor must make available for the purposes of the bankruptcy which it is seeking to procure in the presentation of the petition  the security which advantages that creditor over all unsecured creditors if the trustee so requires  Obviously  if the secured creditor values the security at nil  the trustee may decide not to require it to be made over  but the secured creditor must also make clear that it has a debt of at least the minimum statutory amount   which may be proved for in the bankruptcy the petition seeks to bring about  That is  that sum is unsecured because the security is inadequate citedIn Re A Debtor  Ex parte Okill v The Debtor  Okill v Gething     WLR  The failure of a secured creditor correctly to state in a creditors  petition that it is secured at

  ALR at    Bowen CJ  CA Sweeney and Lockhart JJ held that the Court s discretion had been enlivened under s   of the Act and it could make a sequestration order in such circumstances although the occasions on which it would do so would not be frequent   ALR at    I am not persuaded that I should find  on the evidence before me  that the McClymonts are solvent  Mr McClymont has recently rendered bills for his professional services of   which he said in evidence would be paid this month  He claims to have other work in progress worth   the details of which have not been identified at all by him  despite being offered the opportunity in cross examination to do so  The work in progress is not defined as to when it was undertaken or when Mr McClymont will be in a position to render accounts for it  Nor is there any identification of the likelihood of payment when accounts are finally rendered  The mortgage of   is likely to attract outgoings  even on an interest only basis  of in the order of at least     yearly  Likewise  there are rates  taxes and outgoings to maintain the home unit property  Mr and Mrs McClymont also have to live and incur the ordinary expenses associated with doing so  On their current assets and income as disclosed in the evidence  I do not consider that they have proved that they are solvent  particularly having regard to the fact that they have three judgment debts for over   and no ready cash to meet those liabilities other than the claimed amounts to which Mr McClymont says he is entitled arising from his father s beneficence  It is unlikely that after a lengthy estrangement  a parent will treat the estranged child equally with the other children  Of course  everything in life is possible  But it was for Mr McClymont to put on evidence to satisfy me that it was likely that he was presently entitled to realize within a reasonably proximate time  some or all of the assets which his father has allegedly made over to him  He has not even enquired of his brothers whether they would be prepared to allow him to have access to the money to which he claims he has a present right citedRe Vassis  Ex parte Leung     FCR  The
