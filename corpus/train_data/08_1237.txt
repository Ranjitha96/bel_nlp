there formulated two of those principles as being    Documents generated unilaterally by the expert witness  such as working notes  field notes  and the witness s own drafts of his or her report  do not attract privilege because they are not in the nature of  and would not expose  communications  cf Interchase  Corp Ltd  in liq  v Grosvenor Hill  Qld  Pty Ltd  No       Qd R   at     per Thomas J    Ordinarily disclosure of the expert s report for the purpose of reliance on it in the litigation will result in an implied waiver of the privilege in respect of the brief or instructions or documents referred to in   and   above  at least if the appropriate inference to be drawn is that they were used in a way that could be said to influence the content of the report  because  in these circumstances  it would be unfair for the client to rely on the report without disclosure of the brief  instructions or documents     For the purposes of resolving the present claims for privilege  an inference may be drawn that the   handwritten annotations   of Ms Chylek most probably contain observations in respect to the email or the draft expert report then before her  The onus upon the Fifth Respondent of establishing privilege  albeit on minimal material  has been made out  Those handwritten annotations it is thus considered are privileged  as is Document   the email from Ms Chylek to the expert   The documents  it may generally be accepted  were confidential   Documents   and   are draft expert reports  The draft expert reports  however  are not considered to be privileged and the onus imposed upon the Fifth Respondent to establish the claim has not been discharged  A draft report from an expert  together with a communication from an expert to a solicitor    do not attract privilege because they are not in the nature of  and would not expose  communications   per Lindgren J  Nor  if it be relevant  is there any evidence that the draft reports were given for the purpose of obtaining the input of the solicitors  New Cap Reinsurance Corp Ltd  in liq  v Renaissance Reinsurance Ltd   NSWSC    That was a case arising under s   of the Evidence Act    Cth  and not the common law  All that is known of the draft reports in the present proceeding is simply that  namely they are   draft reports    Nothing is known as to the reasons why such drafts were prepared and nothing is known as to whether the disclosure of a draft report prepared by the independent expert would disclose anything other than the contents of a draft of a report which was subsequently filed

summarised the position as follows  It is well accepted that the court in allowing production and inspection of documents exercises a judicial discretion  In so doing it needs to scrutinize with care claims of privilege made on the ground now under consideration  It is for the party claiming privilege to show that the documents for which the claim is made are privileged  He may succeed in achieving this objective by pointing to the nature of the documents or by evidence describing the circumstances in which they were brought into existence  But it should not be thought that the privilege is necessarily or conclusively established by resort to any verbal formula or ritual  The court has power to examine the documents for itself  a power which has perhaps been exercised too sparingly in the past  springing possibly from a misplaced reluctance to go behind the formal claim of privilege  It should not be forgotten that in many instances the character of the documents the
