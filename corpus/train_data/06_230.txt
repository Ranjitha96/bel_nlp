the exercise of their commercial judgment  and that if the resolution proposed to be put at the meeting was passed by the majorities prescribed by s  a ii  of the Act such a decision by the members could support an order by the Court that the proposed arrangement be approved   See  Re ACM Gold Ltd     FCR   per O Loughlin J at     The requirement of s  a  of the Act that the Court be satisfied that the arrangement has not been proposed for the purpose of enabling the takeover provisions of Ch   of the Act to be avoided  obliged the Court to consider whether a  break fee  of     that the directors of the plaintiff had bound the plaintiff to pay to IAMGOLD if another offer to buy the shares of the plaintiff caused the members to reject the proposed arrangement  could have affected the market in the plaintiff s shares and have infringed the spirit of the provisions of Ch   of the Act   Section   of the Act provides that it is a purpose of Ch   to ensure that acquisition of control

under s   the Court must be satisfied that the proposed explanatory statement provides sufficient disclosure of matters relevant to the proposed arrangement and be able to form the opinion that acceptance of such an arrangement by members could be regarded by reasonable business people to be a decision made for the benefit of members   See  Re Sonodyne International Ltd     ACLC     In the instant case the proposed arrangement to be put to the members for acceptance was that the whole of the shareholding in the plaintiff be acquired by IAMGOLD Corporation  IAMGOLD  and that the plaintiff become a wholly owned subsidiary of IAMGOLD  In its terms the proposed arrangement  if approved by the Court  would effect a compulsory acquisition of all of the shares in the Plaintiff without compliance with the takeover provisions of Ch   of the Act    Given that the proposed arrangement would bind all members  notwithstanding the terms of s   of the Act   the Court had to have regard to whether the explanatory statement provided sufficient detail of the benefits and detriments of the proposed arrangement for members to be sufficiently informed to be able to make a commercial judgment on whether the proposed arrangement was in their interests  That is to say  the Court had to be satisfied that all information a member may regard as material to a decision on the
