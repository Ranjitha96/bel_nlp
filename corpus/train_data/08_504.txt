to an account of profits made by the infringers in the period up to the assignment and that the assignee alone would have the right to any profits made by the infringers after that date  Likewise  if

disclosure  of the invention claimed  F Hoffman La Roche   Co v Commissioner of Patents   HCA         CLR   at   Lockwood   at     GMCA submits that the claims are not fairly based  It says that the

stroke length ranges  They also refer to a  plurality  of positions whereas in fact there are only two   Whatever may be the position in relation to claim   the claims from claim   onwards  and in

with approval by the Full Court in Foggin v Lacey     IPR   at    Gummow J said      i  first impressions are important in determining whether there is an infringement of a design   ii  an obvious imitation is one which is not the same as the registered design but is a copy apparent to the eye notwithstanding slight differences   iii  the question must be looked at as one of substance and by examining the essential features of the design   iv  a closer correspondence between the registered design and the alleged infringing design is necessary to satisfy the test of obvious imitation than that of fraudulent imitation   v  precise mathematical comparisons or matters of measurements or ratios  which form no part of the mental picture which the eye conveys to the brain of shape or configuration suggested by the design  are not to be applied as the test of infringement  appearance to the eye is the critical issue  and  vi  questions of infringement must not be determined by a narrow or overly technical approach in comparison between the design and the alleged infringement  lest the registration be sapped of its worth to the registered owner   As the Full Court in Foggin noted  it is for the Court to rule on the meaning of the design and question of infringement as determined by reference to the eye of the consumer   My first  and continuing  impression is that product B is significantly different in appearance from the Design  In particular the shank is quite different  What is in issue here is an everyday product  To the lay person this looks like a saw  obviously not a hand saw but one with some attachment in the shape of the shank  I regard this as more important than differences in angles and proportions  Put simply  the Design shows a saw blade with a shank  product B is a saw with a different sort of shank   As might be expected experts on either side gave differing views  Professor Redmond thought that the dominant aspect of the Design was the blade and that product B was  closely similar  such that it has the same appeal to the eye as the design in the  Design   He saw the shank as an  attachment device  but the saw blade was the  core or crucial visual element   The shank was  peripheral  or  of less significance   Nevertheless I think the ordinary consumer would see a panel saw blade as a piece of metal with teeth along the bottom and a sloping top  The shank is at one end  and thus is in a literal sense peripheral  but it is  and would be seen as  an integral and distinctive part of the article citedGeneral Tire   Rubber Co v

only seven were relied on  The general comment can be made that although some of the devices could perhaps as a matter of physical possibility be used as a jigsaw there was no clear direction that this was their intended use   This device was in evidence and is also described in the Bosch   Catalogue  It is described as a  multisaw  and is pictured as being used in panel saw mode  There are

to find a fraudulent imitation it was not necessary to show that the differences between alleged infringement and design had been made to disguise the copying  In this respect their Honours at   qualified the statement in Malleys Limited v J W Tomlin Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    In Polyaire their Honours at   accepted the submission  that the application of a  fraudulent imitation  requires that the application of the design be with knowledge of the existence of the registration and of the absence of consent to its use  or with reason to suspect those matters  and that the use of the design produces what is an  imitation  within the meaning of para  a   of s    This    is the knowledge  belief or intent which renders the conduct fraudulent   In a footnote to that passage their Honours say  See as to the permissible inference by a jury of fraud against a party who  wilfully shuts his eyes  the judgment of Lord Esher MR in English and Scottish Mercantile Investment Co Ltd v Brunton     QB   at       As the submissions of Black   Decker appear to accept  the knowledge  belief or intent which does or does not render the conduct fraudulent is that of the Chinese manufacturer  It is the manufacturer who is said to have  applied  the Design outside Australia  I see no reason to disbelieve the evidence of Mr Coates  It seems inherently unlikely that the Chinese manufacturer had knowledge of the Australian Designs Act  still less that the Design was registered under it  There is no basis for finding that the manufacturer had reason to suspect such

s Case   Royal British Bank v Turquand     E   B    Section   provides that a person is entitled to make the assumptions in s   and a person is not entitled to make an assumption under s   if they knew the assumption was incorrect  While there is no evidence in the present case as to the powers of a director of a similar company to BDA  the onus is on GMCA to establish the contrary  In any event  it seems inherently likely that a director of a company similar to BDA  a wholly owned subsidiary of an overseas company  would have authority to execute on the company s behalf a document of the kind executed by Ms Armstrong  A degree of informality is to be expected  The reality is that Ms Armstrong was not  in the time honoured expression  engaged on a frolic of her own   In relation to BDI  Mr Pratt was authorized  by virtue of his office  to execute the Deed  The Deed was clearly in the ordinary course of business of BDI in that it dealt with the licensing of intellectual property  which seems to have been BDI s only business   Black   Decker s case is that because the December   Deed made the March   letter of termination  null and void ab initio  the   Agreement  as varied by the   Deed  continued uninterrupted  As a consequence  BDA is to be treated as having the status of exclusive licensee from at least the date of the   Deed  its case that such status existed from the   Agreement has been rejected for the reasons already given  citedStack v Brisbane City Council     IPR   However  statutory rights to damages or an account of profits conferred on owners or exclusive
