longer considered tenable citedC  Pty Ltd v Foxtel Management Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  A second consideration in relation to the Court s discretion is that Tibra could suffer undue prejudice in respect of the conduct of the anticipated proceedings  Preliminary discovery is an invasive process  and can be granted only where the three limbs of O  A r   are made out  One reason for this is that the grant of preliminary discovery  particularly if the application is as broadly drawn as it is in this case  can place the prospective defendant in a position of disadvantage in respect of the conduct of future negotiations and proceedings  see C  Pty Ltd v Foxtel Management Pty Ltd   FCA   at     Unlike full discovery  where both parties can ascertain and test the strength of the case put against them  preliminary discovery is unilateral  and the Court should be wary of creating an imbalance between the parties  since the purpose of preliminary discovery is not to furnish an applicant with information of such breadth or significance as to prejudice or unnecessarily curtail the respondent s prospects in the proceedings  but rather to ensure an applicant is able to identify and consider the documents and information necessary to commence proceedings   I am of the view that the disclosure at this early stage of Tibra s source code  particularly in circumstances where Optiver already has sufficient information to decide whether to start litigation  would not be consistent with the purposes of O  A r   and would create an inappropriate imbalance between Optiver and Tibra in respect of any litigation   For the above reasons  I dismiss the application with costs   I certify that the preceding forty one   numbered

consideredQuanta Software International Pty Ltd v Computer Management Services Pty Ltd     ALR   Optiver stressed that the question for it to decide pursuant to O  A r  b  is whether it should commence proceedings against Tibra to obtain the relief to which it asserts an entitlement   that is  relief for breach of confidence and copyright  Optiver also referred to the observation by Sackville J in Quanta Software International Pty Ltd v Computer Management Services Pty Ltd     ALR   at   to the effect that an order under O  A r   may be available to assess the extent of any alleged infringement of an applicant s rights  While these are correct statements of principle  I do not believe they are decisive in this case   The observation by Sackville J in Quanta Software   ALR at   was made in the context of dismissing the clearly untenable proposition that  documents relating only to quantum are necessarily irrelevant in determining whether an applicant has satisfied O

process  see Ricegrowers Co Operative Ltd   Seatide Pty Ltd v ABC Containerline NV   MED Containerline Antwerp NV     ALR   at   referred toSt George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd     ALR   The principles concerning whether an applicant for preliminary discovery has a  reasonable cause to believe  are well established  and are summarised by Hely J in St George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd     ALR   at      I do not propose to repeat those principles here   In this case  Optiver has reasonable cause to believe that it may have a right to obtain relief from Tibra  The circumstances outlined above  when taken together  provide sufficient objective basis on which that belief is grounded  I am persuaded that Optiver s belief goes beyond mere conjecture or supposition  rather  Optiver has reasonably formed a conclusion that the circumstances surrounding the departure of its employees and the success of their subsequent business may depend to some degree on a breach of a duty of confidence owed to Optiver or a breach of its copyright   It is important to stress that the above view does not mean that Optiver s belief is correctly held  in the sense that it is likely to be vindicated in the proceedings  The evidence presently before the Court does not  and need not  go so far as to establish a prima facie case or crystallise a successful cause of action  Under O  A r  a  Optiver s evidence need only establish a tenable objective basis for its belief  which it has done  Accordingly  while Tibra s submissions regarding the shortcomings in Optiver s evidence are important  they are not sufficient to weaken the objective grounds on which Optiver asserts its belief to the extent that O  A r  a  is not satisfied  Shortcomings will be relevant if and when the dispute progresses to hearing  at which stage detailed evidence can be fully adduced and weighed   Although the parties disagreed whether Optiver had made all reasonable inquiries before bringing this application  in my view  O  A r  b  is determinative in this case because it prohibits the Court exercising its discretion to grant preliminary discovery where the applicant has sufficient information to enable it to decide whether to commence proceedings to obtain the relief referred to in O  A r  a    I am persuaded that Optiver is equipped with sufficient information to decide whether to commence proceedings to obtain at least some of the relief which it submits may be available to it citedTelstra Corporation Limited v Minister for Communications  Information  Technology and the Arts
