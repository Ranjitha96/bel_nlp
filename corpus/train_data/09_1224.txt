Russell v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedAllied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     NSWLR  It is possible  I suppose  that work as purportedly invoiced was indeed undertaken and that the omission of Vanuatu client income might be referable to an innocent mistake as to a requirement to declare the same in New Zealand  In the absence of corroboration  I am not though prepared to find these facts proved  In so concluding I accept that Mr Russell is not at all obliged to prove to demonstration that Ancath undertook such work  only on the balance of probabilities that it did so  Nor is it the law that an appellant taxpayer can only discharge the onus of proof  even on the balance of probabilities  by the tendering of corroborated evidence  Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     NSWLR    It is just that  recalling on whom the onus lies and applying that standard of proof  I did not regard Mr Russell s uncorroborated evidence on the subject as sufficiently reliable to admit of a conclusion that these facts were proved  I have reached these conclusions without taking into account Mr Russell s New Zealand criminal history  an official copy of which was tendered by the Commissioner in the course of Mr Russell s cross examination  Mr Russell has been convicted in that country of numerous offences of dishonesty including using a document with intent to defraud and forgery  He was  I thought  reluctant to acknowledge his criminal past in cross examination although his statement that it concerned an era in his life that he had sought to put behind him and forget was understandable enough  He also voiced disagreement with his having been truly guilty of some at least of the offences in respect of which convictions were recorded  Mr Russell s criminal history in its own right does give pause for thought about his credibility  However  the divergence in accounts as between evidence in the Industrial Commission and this Court with regard to his control over Ancath engendered in any event my disposition not to act on his uncorroborated testimony as to Ancath s undertaking work for Vanuatu based clients  For completeness  I should record that Mr Russell exhibited to one of his affidavits a letter dated   January   addressed to Ancath  by its new name  Juan International  marked for Mr Miedema s attention from the National Bank of New Zealand which stated that a debit card issued on   November   for use by Mr Russell had never been used  The letter says nothing as to the position in relation to the use of such a debit card during the period of interest in the appeals  Further  the letter is addressed not to any New Zealand address associated with Ancath or Mr Miedema but rather to the company in Australia at a post office box at Sarina  I did not therefore regard the letter as offering any corroboration with respect to the account Mr Russell gave concerning Ancath s affairs and the role he played consideredCommissioner of Taxation v ANZ Savings Bank Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlUpon the institution of an appeal against an objection decision by the Commissioner  the Court is  seized of the decision in its entirety  Commissioner of Taxation v ANZ Savings Bank Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    ANZ Savings Bank Case   In that same case  ibid  it was said of a statutory predecessor of s  ZZP of the TAA  s   of the ITAA   that      This power is expressed in the widest terms  An appeal relates to the objection decision made by the Commissioner albeit a taxpayer is dissatisfied with only part of that decision  A power to make such order as the Court thinks fit is clearly not unconstrained but there is nothing in s   to suggest that the Federal Court may not make such order in relation to the objection decision as is appropriate in all the circumstances once the subject matter of the taxpayer s dissatisfaction with the assessment has been resolved     At the time those remarks were made  the language of s   of the ITAA   was in materially identical terms to those of s  ZZP of the TAA  Section   came to be in that form following amendments made to that section by s   of the Taxation Boards of Review  Transfer of Jurisdiction  Act    Cth   In the ANZ Savings Bank Case  at   it was further observed      The question for the Court hearing an appeal is not whether the grounds of objection have been made out but whether the taxpayer has satisfied the burden cast by s  b  of proving that the assessment is excessive      Since the Court is concerned to determine whether the amounts assessed as taxable income are excessive   the Commissioner must be able to raise for the Court s determination the deductions properly to be allowed in the light of the Court s decision as to assessable income   Emphasis added     The burden once cast on an appellant by s  b  of the ITAA   is now the subject of like provision by s  ZZO b  of the TAA  Here  I have resolved  adversely to him as it transpires  the subject matter of Mr Russell s dissatisfaction with the   year income tax assessment and I have determined that that assessment is not excessive  What then becomes the appropriate order to make in all of the circumstances bearing in mind that the power  though expressed in the widest terms  is not unconstrained followedCommissioner of Taxation v Metaskills Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThat being so  the  results test  then falls to be answered  That test is found in s       of the ITAA    In IRG Technical Services Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR   at       Allsop J  as his Honour then was  observed of that section that its elements  were to be understood against the background of the jurisprudence concerning independent contractors   In so doing  his Honour referred with approval to an earlier observation made by Lindgren J in Commissioner of Taxation v Metaskills Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at       that   Broadly speaking  an individual or entity  who or which is an  independent contractor  under traditional concepts should meet the results test    Their Honours were not in these cases promoting the use of the common law as a substitute for the language of the statute  for that would clearly be erroneous  It is just that  for example  the phrase  the income is for producing a result  in s        a  and s        a  of the ITAA   obviously draws upon one of the traditional touchstones for distinguishing between a contract for service and a contract of service  Thus guidance offered by cases decided at common law as to whether a payment is or is not for the production of a result is relevant  That this is what Parliament intended is confirmed by recourse to secondary materials  as Allsop and Lindgren JJ note in their respective judgements  Approaching the matter this way  I respectfully agree with their Honours observations in relation to s         As to the   rule  Lindgren J made the following observation in Commissioner of Taxation v Metaskills Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at       with which I respectfully agree      Subsection     distinguishes between two situations  namely  where less than   of an individual s personal services income  not including certain specified classes of income not presently relevant  is income from the same entity  and where   or more of an individual s personal services income is income from the same entity  In the former case  less than   from the same entity  if any one or more of the four personal services business tests is satisfied  the personal services income is taken to be from a personal services business  and it is not necessary to apply for a personal services business determination  In the latter case   or more from the same entity  if the results test is satisfied  the personal services income is taken to be from a personal services business  and it is not necessary to apply for a personal services business determination  But otherwise  it is necessary for there to be a personal services business determination in force  if the personal services income is to be taken to be from a personal services business  On the findings I have made with respect to the purported Vanuatu invoices and his evidence concerning them  Mr Russell has failed to prove that  in any of the income years in question  more than   of Ancath s income did not come from the one source  During those income years Tradecorp was the source of Ancath s income and that income in turn was a reflection of Mr Russell s efforts or skills  For completeness  I should record that Mr Russell did not lead any evidence which would admit of a conclusion that either the unrelated clients test found in s         the employment test found in s       or the business premises test found in s       of the ITAA   were satisfied appliedCommissioner of Taxation v Wade   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlMr Russell also alleged that the Commissioner s staff had not given him notice that an income tax audit in respect of his personal  as opposed to the partnership s taxation affairs was being conducted  that this was a breach of the  Taxpayer s Charter  and that  accordingly  the Commissioner was  estopped  from issuing amended assessments  It is not necessary to explore the merits of the factual substratum of this allegation  Even if true  no conduct on the part of the Commissioner can affect the operation of a taxing statute in respect of facts the occurrence of which gives rise to a taxation liability  Commissioner of Taxation v Wade   HCA         CLR   at   per Kitto J  Mr Russell further advanced in his written submissions that there was no lawful ability to  reopen  ie issue amended assessments in respect of the   and   income years  This was not raised as a ground of objection in respect of the assessments  He is confined to those grounds in the absence of a grant of leave to amend  I decline to grant any such leave  So to do after the close of evidence would not be fair to the Commissioner who did not as the objection stood choose or need to lead evidence in respect of the formation of an opinion that in these income years there had been an avoidance of tax due to fraud or evasion  The Court s powers on the hearing of a taxation appeal are set out in s  ZZP of the TAA  It is there provided that   the Court may make such order in relation to the decision as it thinks fit  including an order confirming or varying the decision   The  decision  referred to in this section is the Commissioner s objection decision citedComptroller General of Customs v Woodlands Enterprises Pty Ltd     Qd R  There is nothing in the judgements delivered in the Full Court which would call into question the correctness of her Honour s conception of what constitutes  intentional disregard   I respectfully agree with her Honour s observations  They serve to confirm what a reading in context of  results from intentional disregard  would otherwise suggest  Within s     of Schedule   to the TAA  Parliament has specified gradations of increasing severity in terms of conduct by a taxpayer or his  her or its agent which has resulted in a tax shortfall  Of these   intentional disregard  is the most serious in terms of the infliction of a base penalty  It is intended to be qualitatively different to and more severe than  recklessness   That suggests that wilful blindness of a kind which in other contexts has been regarded as sufficient to supply the mental element in adverbial qualifications such as  knowingly  or  wilfully  q v  Iannella v  French   HCA         CLR   at     per Barwick CJ and Comptroller General of Customs v Woodlands Enterprises Pty Ltd     Qd R   at     per Pincus JA  McPherson JA agreeing  is insufficient to supply the mental element in  intentional disregard   Rather  conduct of that wilfully blind kind would fall under the rubric of  recklessness  for base penalty purposes consideredCornell v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn Cornell v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   and at a time when s   of the Income Tax Assessment Act    Cth   ITAA   was in a form not materially distinguishable from s   of the ITAA   as it stood prior to its amendment in   i e  the words  increase or vary  were employed in relation to the assessment  it was opined  at   in a joint judgement of six judges that  the fact that an assessment is for too small an amount is  not  any reason for setting aside the assessment at the instance of the person assessed   That judgement is silent as to whether the assessment might have been increased at the instance of the Deputy Commissioner  had positions been reversed  although the express conferral of a power to increase the assessment suggests that such an order could lawfully then have been made citedEll v Commissioner of Taxation   ATC  More recently  but no less helpfully  Emmett J had this to say on the subject in Ell v Commissioner of Taxation   ATC   at           Although not determinative  intention is relevant where  for example  a particular activity produces no income  see John v FCT   HCA         CLR   or where the first step in a business is undertaken  see Fairwell States Pty Ltd v FCT   HCA         CLR    It is necessary to examine the activities engaged in  including their nature and extent  see Martin v FCT   HCA         CLR   at    Activities may constitute the carrying on of a business even though the activities are carried on in a small way and it is not for the Commissioner to dictate to a taxpayer in which business the taxpayer engages or how to run a business profitably or economically  see Tweedle v FCT   HCA         CLR    Provided that an activity said to constitute carrying on business is engaged in for the purpose of profit on a continuous and repetitive basis  that activity may constitute the carrying on of business  see Hope v Bathurst City Council   HCA         CLR        If there were no real expectation of a profit from engaging in a particular activity  there will be real doubt as to whether engaging in that activity can be said to be the carrying on of a business  Where the expenses and outgoings of an activity are disproportionate to any income that might reasonably have been expected from engaging in the activity that involved incurring those expenses and outgoings  it may be legitimate to draw an inference that the expenses and outgoings were not incurred in gaining or producing the relevant assessable income but were incurred for some other purpose     Where expenses and outgoings claimed as deductions are disproportionate to the assessable income produced  subjective factors  including the direct and indirect objects of a taxpayer  may become determinative  see Fletcher v FCT   HCA         CLR   at      Where an expense or outgoing claimed as an expense or outgoing of a business is disproportionate to any assessable income that may be gained  it will not be as easy to conclude that the expense or outgoing was incurred in gaining or producing that income  see Spassked Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC         FCR   at       The state of mind or intention of a taxpayer may be relevant to the question of whether or not that taxpayer is carrying on a business  Even where a transaction produces no income  if the intention of the relevant taxpayer is that the transaction is the first step in a business  that subjective state of mind may be relevant  The acquisition of Athena was  the Taxpayers say  the first step in the carrying on of a business  see Fairway Estate Pty Ltd v FCT   HCA         CLR   at      Further  it is not for the Commissioner to dictate to a taxpayer in what way a business should be run  A business may be carried on even though it is not profitable or economical  see Tweedle v FCT   HCA         CLR     provided it is carried on with the purpose of making a profit  see FCT v Stone   ATC   at    The Taxpayers say that they had a profit making purpose or intention in relation to the use of Athena  As is clear from the definition of  enterprise  an activity which would not under these general conceptions be regarded as a business  eg an isolated venture in the nature of trade  can nonetheless fall within the definition  One must therefore be careful not wholly to assimilate the concept of a business for income tax law purposes with the concept of an  enterprise  for GST law purposes  In the present case though the extensions beyond  business  evident in the definition of  enterprise  are not raised on the facts  Was an  enterprise  in the form of an accounting practice carried on by the partnership in the period from   July   to the date of its dissolution on   February  Mr Russell s evidence was that  under the name AW Russell and Co  an accountancy practice was carried on  His oral evidence was that there was  nothing much  by way of clients for such a practice in this period apart from Ancath  There was likewise  nothing much  in any other evidence would suggest that the partnership had any wider clientele during the period prior to   February    Mr Russell introduced in evidence what purported to be a written agreement made between the partnership and Ancath in August   for the provision of services to Ancath by the partnership  Mr Russell instanced his being made available to Tradecorp to fulfil Ancath s obligation to Tradecorp under the Tradecorp Agreement as the provision of services to Ancath by the partnership citedFerguson v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe observations made by Bowen CJ and Franki J on the subject in Ferguson v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FLR   at   are of general assistance      There are many elements to be considered  The nature of the activities  particularly whether they have the purpose of profit making  may be important  However  an immediate purpose of profit making in a particular income year does not appear to be essential  Certainly it may be held a person is carrying on business notwithstanding his profit is small or even where he is making a loss  Repetition and regularity of the activities is also important  However  every business has to begin  and even isolated activities may in the circumstances he held to be the commencement of carrying on business  Again  organization of activities in a business like manner  the keeping of books  records and the use of system may all serve to indicate that a business is being carried on  The fact that  concurrently with the activities in question  the taxpayer carries on the practice of a profession or another business  does not preclude a finding that his additional activities constitute the carrying on of a business  The volume of his operations and the amount of capital employed by him may be significant  However  if what he is doing is more properly described as the pursuit of a hobby or recreation or an addiction to a sport  he will not be held to be carrying on a business  even though his operations are fairly substantial followedHart v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR  Of the two immediately lesser base penalty percentages  the definitive way of conceiving their differentiation and application is that offered  again in respect of materially analogous predecessor provisions in the ITAA   by the majority in Hart v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   at         Recklessness is a concept well known to the law  particularly in the fields of tort and criminal law  In those fields  recklessness will usually be found to have been established if the person s conduct shows disregard of  or indifference to  consequences foreseeable by a reasonable person  In some contexts a subjective test is applied  but in others the test is objective  In BRK  Bris  Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         ATR   at   Cooper J made the following observations in relation to recklessness in the context of s  H               Recklessness in this context means to include in a tax statement material upon which the Act or regulations are to operate  knowing that there is a real  as opposed to a fanciful risk  that the material may be incorrect  or be grossly indifferent as to whether or not the material is true and correct  and that a reasonable person in the position of the statement maker would see there was a real risk that the Act and regulations may not operate correctly to lead to the assessment of the proper tax payable because of the content of the tax statement  So understood  the proscribed conduct is more than mere negligence and must amount to gross carelessness                 There is a line between recklessness and dishonesty  and as the Explanatory Memorandum for the Taxation Laws Amendment  Self Assessment Bill    Cth   at p   confirms  a finding of dishonesty is not necessary for a taxpayer to be subject to a s  H penalty  Wherever a tax return includes deductions that are not allowable  a foreseeable consequence is that there will be a tax shortfall  particularly in a system of self assessment  But  in the ordinary case  the mere fact that a tax return includes a deduction which is not allowable is not of itself sufficient to expose the taxpayer to a penalty  Negligence  at least must be established although there are some sections  eg s  K  which impose a liability in particular circumstances even if the taxpayer has not been negligent  The context makes it clear that recklessness means something more than failure to exercise reasonable care  s  G  but less than an intentional disregard of the Act  s  J   On the characterisation of events which I prefer  Mr Russell has not exhibited disregard of  or indifference to  consequences reasonably foreseeable by a reasonable person  I do not consider that he has been  reckless   Has he  nonetheless  failed to take reasonable care to comply with the ITAA   in particular  Part     such that a tax shortfall has resulted in each income year Mr Russell seems to me to have operated on the assumption  notwithstanding his professed ignorance at the time of Australian income tax law  that his and Ancath s positions under Australian income tax law were  for all practical purposes  the same as those which prevailed under the New Zealand income tax law with which he had at least passing familiarity  He had this to say in cross examination about the nature and extent of his knowledge of the two countries  taxation regimes      HIS HONOUR  You didn t seek to explore whether your New Zealand qualifications might translate into Australian registration    For accounting to Australia  I was aware that there were extra examinations that would have to be done  and I just wasn t interested  Whilst some of the tax law is very similar to New Zealand  there are lots of areas that are totally different  and  in fact  so different that there isn t a comparable in New Zealand  And I was just my days of study are long gone  and I just wasn t interested     I took this to be indicative of Mr Russell s position throughout the income years in question and when he came to prepare his returns for those years  The adoption of Ancath as the entity via which Tradecorp would come to have the benefit of his services exhibited a degree of sophistication on both Mr Russell s and Mr Zarb s parts  He was not to be just one of Tradecorp s wage and salary earners  Yet he must have known  or at least he has not disproved  that he knew that he and only he was to perform all of the work for which Tradecorp was to pay money  Had he undertaken that work as an employee of Tradecorp there could have been no question that he would thereby be personally liable to Australian income tax as a wage and salary earner  Yet  notwithstanding the degree of sophistication in the arrangement and his realisation that there were  lots of areas  in which Australian taxation law was  totally different  to that of New Zealand and his own lack of interest in studying Australian taxation law  he chose not to seek any advice at all about what might be the Australian taxation law consequences of the adoption of the arrangement whereby Ancath came to be interposed  That to me in the circumstances was a failure to take reasonable care to comply with the ITAA    In each income year that failure resulted in a false statement being made by Mr Russell as to his assessable income and  in turn  to a tax shortfall  Having regard to item   of the table in s     of schedule   to the TAA  he is liable under s     to pay an administrative penalty of   of his shortfall amount for these income years citedIannella v French   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThere is nothing in the

Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     CLR  There remains the question of whether the Commissioner was in error not to remit any penalty  As to this  either by concession or by virtue of the conclusions which I have reached in respect of applicable base penalty category  the Commissioner s decision is exposed as one founded on premises which were wrong in law  It thus falls to the Court to reach its own conclusion as to how the Commissioner ought to have exercised his remission discretion  see  by analogy  Kolotex Hosiery  Australia  Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation     CLR   at     and      That art   of the NZ Double Taxation Agreement looks to enterprise  not profit per se  is  as the French decision I have noted in respect of this type of OECD Model Agreement  underscores a subject of some controversy and  in domestic law  hitherto novelty  Further  Mr Russell was patently not seeking to conceal Ancath s income from Tradecorp from revenue officers on both sides of the Tasman Sea  He was careless  but these two factors  in my opinion  tell in favour of the remission of the whole of the penalty on this occasion  Goods and Services Tax Assessment I have already concluded that the

reached by the Industrial Commission as to Mr Russell s credibility  his status vis   vis Tradecorp  whether Ancath had a contract for service with Tradecorp or whether Mr Russell ought properly to be

Tradecorp at its Mackay business premises for about four years between August   and August   is clear  His title when performing that work was that of Tradecorp s  financial controller   He was appointed to undertake that work by Tradecorp s managing director  Mr Tony Zarb  That followed an interview with Mr Zarb and Tradecorp s outgoing financial controller  Ms Gillian Sandhoff  It is also clear that Mr Russell ceased undertaking this work following a breakdown in relations between him and Mr Zarb  It is not necessary in these proceedings to explore the rights  wrongs and responsibilities for that breakdown in relations  Relations between Tradecorp and Ancath were at least purportedly regulated by a written agreement made between those companies made on   August    the

Peerless Marine Pty Ltd and Commissioner of Taxation   AATA       ATC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth aat  htmlSaffron v Commissioner of Taxation     ATC    Saffron s Case  is a case which preceded the ANZ Savings Bank Case but which was decided after the   amendments  Saffron s Case was an appeal from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  not an appeal in the original jurisdiction against an objection decision  Nonetheless  in his reasons for judgement  Davies J  at     made the following observations of a generic nature as to the role of either this Court or the Tribunal when seized with a challenge to  termed by him a review of  an objection decision      The review authority  the Court or the Tribunal  must come to its own decision on the facts and the issues  Walsh J said in Krew s case at             I have a duty to reach my own conclusions on the questions of fact which have to be decided and to give effect to those conclusions     I must make my own decisions as to the facts           Although the taxpayer may be untruthful and a tax evader  that factor  of itself  is no reason not to undertake a calculation of income tax as contemplated by the Act  if such a calculation can be made  As Walsh J said in Krew s case at    A witness upon whose word one cannot rely may yet give evidence which is true in part   In that case  although Walsh J held that he could not accept the appellant himself as a reliable witness  he nevertheless found that several of the facts alleged by the taxpayer were established as a matter of probability and accordingly that four of the amended assessments before the Court should be set aside  Moreover  in the calculation of the taxable incomes of years past  exact proof may not be available  As Burchett J said in Ma v Commissioner of Taxation     ATC   at          the making of estimates upon Inexact evidence  which IS so much a feature of both judicial and administrative decision making  cannot be uniquely excluded from appeals against betterment assessments           If  despite the general untruthfulness of a witness and the lack of records  the Court or the Tribunal nevertheless feels satisfied  as a matter of probability  as to the existence of a relevant fact or factor  effect must be given to that conclusion     Though these observations predate by some months those made later in that year by the High Court in the ANZ Savings Bank Case   they draw upon the same cases which the High Court regarded as authoritative and are not inconsistent with the High Court s own observations  However  though the observation made by Davies J that  effect must be given to that conclusion  is no less generic than his Honour s other observations  it is necessary to recall that he was not called upon in that case expressly to decide whether it was within the Court s power to set aside the objection decision so as to increase the amount of an appellant taxpayer s taxable income  The other two judges constituting the Full Court in Saffron s Case   Gummow and Lee JJ  did not find it necessary to make such generic observations  A number of propositions may be distilled from the authorities as to what constitutes the carrying on of a  business   adopting for this purpose a summary which commended itself to Deputy President Hack SC in Re Peerless Marine Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   AATA       ATC    Peerless Marine Identifying the  commencement  of a business is  obviously  a question of fact but that does not mean that the question will always admit of an easy answer  That is nicely illustrated by Peerless Marine   Peerless Marine professed to be carrying on a boat production business in respect of luxury motor cruisers  It had sold none but sought  inter alia  to claim input tax credits in respect of the design and construction of a prototype  It succeeded in establishing that its then activity did amount to an  enterprise  for GST purposes because  inter alia  there was evidence that the development and successful exhibiting and availability for inspection of a prototype was an essential first step in the carrying on of such a business  not a precursor to the commencement of that business  Determining whether or not a particular business exists calls for a thorough understanding of the nature of the market in which the asserted business operates and exactly what is entailed in commencing to carry on business in that market  On this basis  the partnership is not entitled to the input tax credits claimed because they were not acquired for a creditable purpose  During the course of what Mr Russell termed  Stage   in his business plan  there was not yet a business of a naturist retreat being carried on  only the undertaking of steps which were precursors to the commencement of such a business  A remaining issue is whether  insofar as it related to a period prior to   July   the issuing of the GST assessment was beyond power  The inspiration for Mr Russell s raising this issue would seem to be the supposed expiration of the   year period after which  subject to an exception to which I shall shortly refer  in the absence of a notice from the Commissioner within that period requiring payment  an unpaid net amount together with any related general interest charge ceases to be payable  see s     of Schedule   to the TAA  The exception to this statutory expiration arises where the Commissioner is satisfied that the payment of the amount was avoided by fraud or evasion followedPrice Street Professional Centre Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         ATR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlGuidance as to what constitutes  intentional disregard  for the purposes of determining a base penalty amount was offered by Collier J in Price Street Professional Centre Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         ATR   at   when considering a materially analogous predecessor provision  s  J of the ITAA         As made clear by the Explanatory Memorandum to the Taxation Laws Amendment  Self Assessment  Bill   which introduced s  J  s  J requires knowledge by the taxpayer that  for example  it has claimed a deduction knowing that it is not allowable  Accordingly   intentional disregard  of the ITAA   or regulations requires  inter alia  an understanding by the taxpayer of the effect of the relevant legislation or regulations  an appreciation by the taxpayer of how that legislation or regulation applies to the circumstances of the taxpayer  and finally  deliberate conduct of the taxpayer so as to flout the ITAA   or regulations  The legislation treats  intentional disregard  differently from  and more seriously than  negligence to comply with the Act  cf s  G  or recklessness with

Taxation   FCAFC         ALR   consideredRe A Oyi Abp     ITLR  Of these  the case from which I have derived particular assistance is a decision of Finland s Supreme Administrative Court in relation to whether an inconsistency existed between the attribution rules in that country s controlled foreign company  CFC  regime in its domestic revenue law and art   of its double taxation agreement with Belgium  which was in conformity with the OECD Model  Re A Oyi Abp     ITLR    Re A Oyi Apb   In that case  the Supreme Administrative Court observed  at       Tax treaties are therefore concerned with judicial double taxation which means that the same taxable person is taxed on the same income in two different countries  Tax treaties do not generally concern economic double taxation  that is  where the same income is taxed in the hands of several taxable persons  Unless otherwise provided in a tax treaty  the removal of economic double taxation is a task which remains the responsibility of the national legislation  The tax treaty between Finland and Belgium does not contain provisions on the removal of economic double taxation  The actual decision in that case was that that the French CFC regime was in conflict with and was overridden by the relevant tax treaty  However  on closer analysis  the tax treaty concerned contained  apart from an OECD Model art   provision  another provision  art  A  which expressly exempted from the relevant French tax  income     where such income is liable to taxation in Switzerland   Against that background  where the treaty itself authorised a focus on income per se  rather than enterprise  the seeming incongruence of result with that in Re A Oyi Abp is explicable  There is no equivalent of art  A  of the Franco Swiss Double Taxation Agreement in the NZ Double Taxation Agreement  Assistance in the resolution of any doubt about the focus of art   cl   is gained by having regard to the commentary concerning the OECD Model  I refer to the commentary as published in OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital  Condensed Version     and Key Tax Features of Member countries   published by IBFD  Copyright as to the Convention  OECD and as to the Key Features  IBFD  OECD Commentary   Article   cl   of the NZ Double Taxation Agreement replicates art   cl   of the OECD Model Convention consideredRe Judiciary and Navigation Acts   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlOne constraint on the width of the powers which the Court may now exercise under s  ZZP of the TAA must be the nature and extent of the  matter  in respect of which the Court is invested with Federal jurisdiction  In respect of a taxation appeal that investment of jurisdiction is implicit in the conferring  pursuant to s  ZZ of the TAA  on a person dissatisfied with the Commissioner s objection decision of a right of appeal to this Court against that decision as an alternative to applying to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for the review of that decision  Since   it has been the correctness of the decision on the objection against the assessment which is  in terms of the formulation of  matter  in Re Judiciary and Navigation Acts   HCA         CLR   at    the subject matter for determination  and the source of the  immediate right  duty or liability to be established by the determination of the Court   The Commissioner s obligation in respect of an objection is  materially  within the required period  to decide whether to What s  ZY does not put forward as an alternative for the Commissioner in deciding the objection is the increasing of the assessment which is the subject of the objection  That being so  it would be seem an odd result if the subject matter for determination on appeal included whether the Commissioner should not only have disallowed the objection but also whether he should have increased it  In respect of the   to   income years  s   of the ITAA   then provided        Nothing contained in this section shall prevent the amendment of any assessment in order to give effect to the decision upon any appeal or review  or its amendment by way of reduction in any particular in pursuance of an objection made by the taxpayer or pending any appeal or review   Emphasis added     Apart from the express reference to reduction  the absence of any reference to  increase  will be noted consideredRe Soci t  Schneider Electric     ITLR  There are passages in a decision of the French Conseil d tat in Re Soci t  Schneider Electric     ITLR   which  read in isolation  might be thought to support an opposite conclusion in relation to the immateriality of economic consequences when considering whether a national CFC regime was in conflict with Article   of an OECD model treaty with Switzerland  For example  in referring to Article   of the Franco Swiss double taxation agreement  the Conseil d tat opined  at       In the absence of any factor requiring a different interpretation  the  profits  to which art   of the convention refers are those determined according to the rules established by the  French General Tax Code   It follows that the court below did not make any error in deciding that there is an identity in nature between the business profits  b n fices  of the Paramer company  the taxation of which is attributed to Switzerland by art   of the Franco Swiss tax treaty  and the profitable results  r sultats beneficiaries  of the Paramer company which are taxed in France in the name of the Schneider company on the basis of the  CFC regime in the French General Tax Code  citedRussell v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlMr Russell s work as an accountant and his ambitions for his premises have given rise both to income tax and to goods and services tax controversies  These have come to manifest themselves in appeals under Part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act    Cth   TAA   In an interlocutory judgement delivered last year I concluded that it was both lawfully possible for him to join his appeals in the one application and that the overlap in the underlying facts was such that it was in the interests of justice that his income tax and goods and services tax  GST  appeals be heard together  Russell v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR    Mr Russell appeared on his own behalf on the hearing of the appeals whereas the respondent Commissioner of Taxation  the Commissioner  was represented by senior and junior counsel  It is no reflection on counsel  who provided valuable assistance  to observe that both in oral and written submissions Mr Russell argued his case with marked and memorable skill  This included the ability  not always found in litigants in person  for the most part to distinguish between his distinct roles as advocate and as witness  While I respect his skill and ability  it does not  as will be seen  follow that I accept all of his evidence  The taxation assessments  including the related assessments of penalty  each of which was affirmed upon objection by the Commissioner and which underpin the respective income tax and GST appeals are as follows  Income Tax AssessmentsconsideredSaffron v Commissioner of Taxation     ATC  Saffron v Commissioner of Taxation     ATC    Saffron s Case  is a case which preceded the ANZ Savings Bank Case but which was decided after the   amendments  Saffron s Case was an appeal from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  not an appeal in the original jurisdiction against an objection decision  Nonetheless  in his reasons for judgement  Davies J  at     made the following observations of a generic nature as to the role of either this Court or the Tribunal when seized with a challenge to  termed by him a review of  an objection decision      The review authority  the Court or the Tribunal  must come to its own decision on the facts and the issues  Walsh J said in Krew s case at             I have a duty to reach my own conclusions on the questions of fact which have to be decided and to give effect to those conclusions     I must make my own decisions as to the facts           Although the taxpayer may be untruthful and a tax evader  that factor  of itself  is no reason not to undertake a calculation of income tax as contemplated by the Act  if such a calculation can be made  As Walsh J said in Krew s case at    A witness upon whose word one cannot rely may yet give evidence which is true in part   In that case  although Walsh J held that he could not accept the appellant himself as a reliable witness  he nevertheless found that several of the facts alleged by the taxpayer were established as a matter of probability and accordingly that four of the amended assessments before the Court should be set aside  Moreover  in the calculation of the taxable incomes of years past  exact proof may not be available  As Burchett J said in Ma v Commissioner of Taxation     ATC   at          the making of estimates upon Inexact evidence  which IS so much a feature of both judicial and administrative decision making  cannot be uniquely excluded from appeals against betterment assessments           If  despite the general untruthfulness of a witness and the lack of records  the Court or the Tribunal nevertheless feels satisfied  as a matter of probability  as to the existence of a relevant fact or factor  effect must be given to that conclusion     Though these observations predate by some months those made later in that year by the High Court in the ANZ Savings Bank Case   they draw upon the same cases which the High Court regarded as authoritative and are not inconsistent with the High Court s own observations  However  though the observation made by Davies J that  effect must be given to that conclusion  is no less generic than his Honour s other observations  it is necessary to recall that he was not called upon in that case

austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe NZ Double Taxation Agreement generally follows the OECD Model Double Taxation Agreement  OECD Model   It is settled that  in construing such an agreement  a court may have regard to  inter alia  the OECD Commentary on its model agreement  Thiel v Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at        The interpretative use of that type of extrinsic material is a manifestation of the recognition that a double taxation agreement is but a particular example of an international treaty  The Full Court has sounded a cautionary note in relation to the use for the purpose of interpretation of commentary published after the ratification of a double taxation agreement  McDermott Industries  Aust  Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC         FCR   at      citedThomas v FCT     ALJR  By its very nature  a forestry operation looks to the longer term for its returns  I remind myself  too  that the embarking upon plantings corresponded with a drought in the region of unprecedented severity  That phenomenon and the as yet experimental quality of suitable plantation tree selection for the region serves to explain the appearance of the plantation  Further  as Thomas v FCT     ALJR    Thomas  Case  reminds  a man may carry on business if only in a small and  as Mr McKenzie nicely put it   hickledee pickledee  way  It is possible to see  having regard to Mr Russell s costings  how the plantings might have been regarded as being able to be turned to a profit  I did not regard these costings as but a recent invention on the part of Mr Russell  Taking all of these factors into account  I am satisfied that the partnership did over the period up to   February   carry on an enterprise of forestry operations  It did so in an innovative  perhaps also idiosyncratic  way but with a view to profit  It is not for the Commissioner to limit the entrepreneurial spirit  It follows from this that the partnership was entitled to claim input tax credits in respect of that enterprise  The last enterprise allegedly conducted by the partnership is that of a naturist retreat  Mr Russell put forward in evidence a business plan which he said he prepared in either late   or early   in respect of the enterprise  It is entitled  Catherine s Sarina Nudist Retreat   The plan as detailed in that document is as follows
