process because the substantive defence was a sham  I accept that a sham defence may amount to an abuse of process and may be struck out  see Remington v Scoles     Ch D   discussedWilliams v Spautz   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The plaintiff sought to adduce evidence to show that the claim that the signatory to the agreement and to the mortgage on behalf of the owner did not have the requisite authority could not genuinely be raised  Obviously  the Court should be slow to be persuaded that a pleaded defence based on a matter of fact is not genuinely raised  However  if the Court is satisfied that a defendant has pleaded a fact which it does not genuinely maintain  the inference must follow that it has some extraneous reason for asserting that fact  It may be as simple as an attempt to delay the inevitable  There may be other reasons  If the fact is pleaded for an extraneous purpose  then it may amount to an abuse of process  see e g  Williams v

cases cth HCA  html  In Australian law  even if the defence of the lack of authority of Al Enazy to have signed the documents on behalf of the owner were established  it is likely on the presently available material that     a  the owner would be required to repay the monies advanced in any event  Bank of South Australia v Ferguson   HCA         CLR   and   b  the owner would be estopped by its conduct from saying that the two documents were not validly executed  provided that the plaintiff showed that it had acted on the representations as to the existence of the agreement and of the agreement mortgage   No evidence exists as to whether Kuwaiti law would have the same consequences  and of course the matter in  a  would only result in the existence of an unsecured indebtedness to
