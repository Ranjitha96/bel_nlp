 his Honour said     where a descriptive trade name is used there will always be the possibility of confusion    and  where a descriptive trade name is used it will be difficult for that name to

Centre Ltd     CLR     At   Emmett J earlier said   There is a price to be paid for the advantages flowing from the possession of an eloquently descriptive trade name  Because it is descriptive it is equally applicable to any business of a like kind  Its very descriptiveness ensures that it is not distinctive of any particular business and hence its application to other like businesses will not ordinarily mislead the public    See also the discussion at   regarding possible confusion by the public where  descriptive words are used by two traders as part of their respective trade names  even where the trade names include differentiating words   At       in the Hornsby Building case  Stephen J  with whom Jacobs J agreed  referred to the use of descriptive words in a business name as not

s commentary about the similarity in capitalisation of the website names is also not significant as web addresses are not capital sensitive citedHansen Beverage Company v Bickfords  Australia  Pty Ltd   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Although the Federal Magistrate  at   considered the names of the two websites and the get up of those sites in combination provided the requisite confusion  this finding is at odds with his Honour s earlier observation at   that the two sites are not strikingly similar  So much is evident  at least  when it is remembered that one site is a free service and another a subscriber based service thereby lessening possible confusion  As described by the Federal Magistrate the appearance of the two websites is not sufficiently similar to give rise to confusion on the basis of appearance alone or in combination with the names  The fact that some interested people may be confused between the two sites is an insufficient basis to establish a reasonable likelihood of an appreciable or relevant confusion  That is especially so where there is no finding as to whether the number of possible confused people was significant or otherwise  See Hansen Beverage Company v Bickfords  Australia  Pty Ltd   FCAFC     Having regard to the foregoing it is apparent that JEM s claim under the Act should not have succeeded  The lack of a finding about whether the words insurance  news and Australia   had acquired a distinctive meaning through extensive use is fatal to JEM s ability to maintain the orders it secured below  His Honour did not deal with the claim made by JEM under the tort of  passing off   Rather  his Honour found it unnecessary due to his finding that the respondents succeeded under the TPA  It may be likely that no such claim could be established  In any event  the parties consider  and I agree  that no different result would ensue concerning the passing off claim   The appeal should be allowed  the operative orders below set aside and the appellants should have their costs of the appeal and of the proceeding below   I certify that the preceding twenty three   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the
