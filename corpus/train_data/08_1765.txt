cth HCA  html  The appellant s Notice of Appeal filed   February   contained eight grounds  the first five of which encapsulate the crux of the appellant s appeal to this Court  They provide  His Honour erred in law in A  failing to hold that the Bankruptcy Notice served on the appellant by the respondent was invalid A  failing to hold that  as an invalid Bankruptcy Notice  the Notice was not able to be amended because as a matter of construction ss   and    in providing for a bankruptcy notice founding an Act of Bankruptcy cognisable under the Act  and s    power to amend  must as a matter of construction refer only to a valid notice  and the Court below  FMC  had no jurisdiction to amend or deal in any way with an invalid notice except to pronounce it invalid  A  failing to hold that s   of the Act  in stating that a bankruptcy notice      is not invalidated by reason only that the sum specified in the notice as the amount due to the creditor exceeds the amount in fact due  unless the debtor  within the time allowed for payment  gives notice to the creditor that he or she disputes the validity on the ground of the misstatement            carries the meaning that if notice is duly given of dispute on that ground  the notice is invalid  and invalid ab initio     A  failing to hold that the  amendment  is not within the Court s jurisdiction because it is in reality an assumption of jurisdiction that the legislation does not allow ie the Court cannot hold something made essential by the Act  leading to invalidity of the Bankruptcy Notice  to be inessential    Kleinwort Benson      A  purporting to make an amendment where to do so is not merely to amend but to give validity to what is invalid   Ground A  went to his Honour s decision to hear the Interim Application before the Amended Application to set aside  it does not arise if the appellant succeeds on her primary ground  Grounds A  and A  were not pressed on the hearing of the appeal and can be put to one side   Section   of the Act provides        A bankruptcy notice is not invalidated by reason only that the sum specified in the notice as the amount due to the creditor exceeds the amount in fact due  unless the debtor  within the time allowed for payment  gives notice to the creditor that he or she disputes the validity of the notice on the ground of the misstatement       The power to amend a notice under the Act is relevantly contained in s   of the Act        The Court may                          b  at any time allow the amendment of any written process  proceeding or notice under this Act  or      A bankruptcy notice is clearly a notice under the Act  however  contrary to the submission of the respondent  it is not a proceeding under the Act  It is the issue of a bankruptcy notice which is a proceeding under the Act  Pillai v Comptroller of Income Tax   AC   at   quoted with approval in Kleinwort Benson Australia Ltd v Crowl   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Wilson  Brennan and Gaudron JJ   The respondent submitted that even if a bankruptcy notice is invalid by reason of an overstatement of the amount due to the creditor and the timely giving by the debtor to the creditor of a notice complying with the requirements of s   the most that this does is make failure to comply with it a non event or  to use the words of Deane J in Kleinwort Benson   CLR at        failure to comply with it does not constitute an act of bankruptcy   In the respondent s submission  s  b  of the Act nevertheless empowers the court to  cure  the invalidity by amending the notice so that the amount referred to therein corresponds with the amount due to the creditor   This latter submission was predicated on three underlying arguments    There is no express or implied restriction in the power conferred by s  b  of the Act  such that it does not apply where a bankruptcy notice is invalid    a defective bankruptcy notice is still a bankruptcy notice and therefore s  b  applies to it  and    a bankruptcy notice that is liable to be invalidated is not invalid until a court declares it to be so and therefore the Bankruptcy Notice is not invalid   I have already dealt with the third argument at   above and I reject it   In Kleinwort Benson   CLR at     Mason CJ  Wilson  Brennan and Gaudron JJ said  The authorities show that a bankruptcy notice is a nullity if it fails to meet a requirement made essential by the Act  or if it could reasonably mislead a debtor as to what is necessary to comply with the notice  James v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at   Pillai   AC   at    In such cases the notice is a nullity whether or not the debtor in fact is misled  In re A Judgment Debtor    of       KB   at   consideredKyriackou v Shield Mercantile Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In Kyriackou v Shield Mercantile Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR     Weinberg J concluded at   and     The purpose of a bankruptcy notice is to convey to the debtor the amount claimed by the creditor  and to give the debtor the opportunity to pay or secure that amount  It is important that a bankruptcy notice be prepared with great care  The courts require strict compliance with the Act and Regulations  The reason for this is that a bankruptcy notice sets in train the entire process leading to bankruptcy  a process that has been described as  quasi penal     Formal errors in a bankruptcy notice do not result in its invalidity unless they have caused substantial injustice  However  substantive errors will generally lead to the notice being regarded as invalid and of no effect  If a bankruptcy notice is invalid  any bankruptcy proceedings based upon that notice will be dismissed referred toPillai v Comptroller of Income Tax   AC   A bankruptcy notice is clearly a notice under the Act  however  contrary to the submission of the respondent  it is not a proceeding under the Act  It is the issue of a bankruptcy notice which is a proceeding under the Act  Pillai v Comptroller of Income Tax   AC   at   quoted with approval in Kleinwort Benson Australia Ltd v Crowl   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Wilson  Brennan and Gaudron JJ   In Kleinwort Benson   CLR at     Mason CJ  Wilson  Brennan and Gaudron JJ said  The authorities show that a bankruptcy notice is a nullity if it fails to meet a requirement made essential by the Act  or if it could reasonably mislead a debtor as to what is necessary to comply with the notice  James v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at   Pillai   AC   at    In such cases the notice is a nullity whether or not the debtor in fact is misled  In re A Judgment Debtor    of       KB   at   appliedSeovic Civil Engineering Pty Ltd v Groeneveld   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  At   of his reasons  his Honour observed that there was no issue that the s   Notice did not meet the requirements of s   cf   Seovic Civil Engineering Pty Ltd v Groeneveld   FCA         FCR   at     and then proceeded to deal with the crux of the appeal to this Court  namely  whether the Act allows amendment of a  bankruptcy notice  in respect of which a s   notice has been given  At   his Honour said  It cannot be said that the mere giving of notice under s   invalidates a bankruptcy notice without more  because that would not allow for a situation in which the recipient of the notice could challenge the alleged overstatement  Clearly  a recipient can do this  This means that a declaration of invalidity is something to be done by the court  Why  then  is it not possible for the giver of a notice  a bankruptcy notice  to request the court to allow an amendment thereof before the court has made the declaration  Provided there is no other detriment to the applicant debtor by  for example  giving him a further period of   days to comply with the notice  I cannot see that anything would stand in the way of granting leave   In this particular paragraph  his Honour made no reference to s  b  of the Act  although he had earlier at   of his reasons  but proceeded on the basis that a s   notice did not work any invalidity on a bankruptcy notice until a court declared it to be so  and prior to that the bankruptcy notice could be amended to cure the over claim the subject of a s   notice  I shall return to his Honour s reasoning process below   The legislative history of s   of the Act is set out in the judgment of the Full Court in Seovic   FCR at     and I can do no better than repeat what the Full Court there said    So far we have addressed the construction issue independently of the legislative history of s   of the Bankruptcy Act   That history is  at the least  consistent with the views we have expressed and  on balance  supports the conclusion we have expressed    The antecedents of s   of the Bankruptcy Act are to be found in s   of the Bankruptcy and Deeds of Arrangement Act    UK   the   Act   This subsection provided that a bankruptcy notice issued in respect of a judgment debt under s  g  of the Bankruptcy Act    UK   the predecessor of s  g  of the Bankruptcy Act  was not to be invalidated in certain circumstances  Section   was in the following terms        Notwithstanding anything in the said paragraph  g                 ii  a bankruptcy notice shall not be invalidated by reason only that the sum specified in the notice as the amount due exceeds the amount actually due  unless the debtor within the time allowed for payment gives notice to the creditor that he disputes the validity of the notice on the ground of such misstatement  but  if the debtor does not give such notice  he shall be deemed to have complied with the bankruptcy notice if within the time allowed he takes such steps as would have constituted a compliance with the notice had the actual amount due been correctly specified therein       It has been accepted that s   of the   Act and its Australian counterparts were enacted to overcome the decision by the Court of Appeal in Re a Debtor     KB   Re Prossimo  Ex parte De Marco     ABC    Clyne J  at   Olivieri v Stafford at   per Sweeney ACJ  dissenting  but whose dissent does not affect this question   In Re a Debtor  the bankruptcy notice  which claimed payment of  sterling   s  d  overstated the interest component by  sterling   s  d  Cozens Hardy MR rejected  at   the proposition that the overstatement was a mere  formal defect  that fell within s   of the Bankruptcy Act    UK   the forerunner of s   of the Bankruptcy Act   In his view  to claim payment of a sum that was never due was a substantial defect  regardless of the precise amount of the mistake  Farwell LJ expressed a similar opinion  observing that the statute had to be  strictly followed   He said this  at          I cannot think it is a mere formal defect to include in a bankruptcy notice not only the amount payable under the judgment  but also a sum which is not due and owing at all  and which the debtor has no means of seeing on the face of the notice is not due and owing       As Sweeney ACJ observed in Olivieri v Stafford at   the language employed in s   of the   Act was not limited to the situation which arose in that case  and in the present case  where the bankruptcy notice required the debtor to pay a judgment debt which was due and a further statement of interest  a portion of which was not due  The expression used  the sum specified in the notice as the amount due exceeds the amount actually due     was apt to cover any factual situation which produced an overstatement of the amount due    Section   of the   Act was reproduced as proviso  ii  to s   of the Bankruptcy Act    UK   It was  in turn  adopted as proviso  ii  to s   of the   Act referred to earlier  Section   of the   Act stated that a bankruptcy notice was to be in the prescribed form and was to require the debtor to pay the judgment debt or the sum ordered to be paid in accordance with the terms of the judgment or order  In Re Prossimo  Clyne J described  at   proviso  ii  as in part creating an exception to the general rule that the bankruptcy notice should require the debtor to pay the judgment debt according to the terms of the judgment  The reference to the  amount actually due  in proviso  ii  was intended to qualify the general rule and to require the bankruptcy notice to state the actual amount due  The second part of the proviso was intended to prevent  under certain conditions  a bankruptcy notice being invalid by reason of an overstatement of the amount actually due  But where the bankruptcy notice overstated the amount actually due and the debtor gave a notice in accordance with the proviso  the bankruptcy notice was invalid  In other words  the law as stated in Re a Debtor did not apply unless the debtor gave the creditor a notice complying with proviso  ii  to s   of the   Act    Section   of the Bankruptcy Act follows the form recommended by the Report of the Committee Appointed by the Attorney General of the Commonwealth to Review the Bankruptcy Law of the Commonwealth   chaired by Clyne J and including among its members the Commonwealth Parliamentary Draftsman  Mr J Q Ewens   The Committee made the following observations on cl   of the draft Bill         The provisions contained in section   dealing with the form  contents and service of a bankruptcy notice are considered by the Committee to be generally satisfactory  although the Committee believes that the precise requirements as to such a notice will appear more clearly from the redraft of that section contained in the Bill      Section   of the Bankruptcy Act reproduces the substance of the first part of proviso  ii  to s   of the   Act  while s   reproduces the substance of the second part of proviso  ii     Section   of the Bankruptcy Act incorporates the drafting changes suggested by the Clyne Committee and differs from the first part of proviso  ii  to s   in several respects  These are as follows        Section   is not expressed as a proviso to any other section  However  s   of the Bankruptcy Act   as originally enacted  was similar to the first part of s   of the   Act to which par  ii  was a proviso   Section   in its original form  was repealed in   and replaced with a provision which merely requires the bankruptcy notice to be in accordance with the prescribed form         The subsection uses the expression  the amount in fact due  to replace  the amount actually due  in proviso  ii         The expression  the misstatement  is substituted for the phrase  such misstatement  which was used in proviso  ii         None of these changes is in our view significant for present purposes  There is nothing to indicate that the Clyne Committee intended that the substitution of the definite article for the word  such  in the concluding phrase should bring about any change in the scope and application of s   compared with its predecessor  We of course appreciate that Clyne J had expressed the view in Re Charles Murray that a debtor s notice under proviso  ii  to s   of the   Act did not have to set out the amount of the excess  It may be that his Honour intended to say no more than that a debtor s notice may be capable of complying with the proviso even if it does not specify precisely the excess improperly claimed in the bankruptcy notice  If Clyne J meant to go further  in our respectful opinion  the language of the proviso and of s   does not warrant such a step being taken  The general comments in par   of the Clyne Committee Report cannot be read as a specific endorsement of the decision in Re Charles Murray   In Seovic   FCR  the Full Court ultimately held that the letter of   May   from the debtor s solicitors to the creditor s solicitors did not constitute a notice within the meaning of s   of the Act  Nevertheless  they considered the effect of a debtor s notice under s   of the Act and made the following observations    We have observed that s   of the Bankruptcy Act appears to be drafted on the assumption that a bankruptcy notice is liable to be  invalidated  if the sum specified in the notice exceeds the amount in fact due to the creditor  In Re Walsh     ALR     Lockhart J challenged this assumption  by holding that under the Bankruptcy Act  an over statement of the amount due by the debtor does not necessarily vitiate the bankruptcy notice  His Honour considered     that the bankruptcy notice would be avoided only if the over statement could reasonably mislead the debtor  He said he would decline to follow Re a Debtor and Re Prossimo if they stood in the way of this conclusion    In Re Greenhill  Ex parte Myer  NSW  Ltd     FCR     Morling J declined to follow Re Walsh and held that an over statement in a bankruptcy of the amount actually due renders the notice invalid  whether or not the over statement could reasonably mislead the debtor  Morling J considered that observations by the High Court in Walsh v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR       were inconsistent with Lockhart J s analysis  A similar view was subsequently taken by Pincus J in Re Emerson  Ex parte Wreckair Pty Ltd     ALR   at      affirmed on other grounds  Emerson v Wreckair Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    FC     We have acted on the assumption  not challenged by either party  that Re Greenhill and Re Emerson correctly state the law  However  our view would not be changed if Lockhart J s decision in Re Walsh were ultimately found to be correct  as to which we express no view    As indicated at   of its reasons in Seovic   the Full Court was prepared to act on the assumption that Re Greenhill and Re Emerson correctly state the law  that is  that an overstatement in a bankruptcy notice of the amount in fact due renders the notice invalid  whether or not the overstatement could reasonably mislead the debtor  if a notice complying with the requirements of s   has been duly given  I am prepared to proceed on the same assumption   Of course the foregoing assumes that the notice given by the debtor complies with the requirements of s     cf   Seovic   FCR  and that the debtor s notice cannot be challenged on some other ground such as that the bankruptcy notice does not overstate the amount actually due  It would be open to a creditor  in an appropriate case  to challenge a purported s   notice on either basis  but there is no foundation for a challenge on either basis in the present case   It follows from the foregoing  that I am unable  with respect  to agree with his Honour s reasoning at   of his reasons extracted at   above  First  his Honour s premise that the mere giving of notice under s   cannot invalidate a bankruptcy notice without more could only be correct where there is no overstatement in the bankruptcy notice  They are not the facts here  Second  his reason for coming to that conclusion because that would not allow for a situation in which the recipient of the notice could challenge the alleged overstatement does not provide any support because it would always be open to the creditor  in an appropriate case  to challenge a purported s   notice on either of the bases referred to in   above  Third  the invalidity of a bankruptcy notice that has its source of invalidity in its overstatement of the amount in fact due and the timely giving by the debtor to the creditor of a notice that complies with the requirements of s   is not dependant upon some declaration by a court  In these circumstances  declaration of invalidity by a court is merely declaratory of the operation of the Act to those facts   I am of the view that it would be open to a court to amend  pursuant to s  b  of the Act  a bankruptcy notice that overstated the amount due prior to the debtor giving notice to the creditor pursuant to s   of the Act  If the overstatement is due to clerical error and is one that could not reasonably mislead the debtor  then it may not even be necessary to rely on s  b  at all  s   of the Act may  in those circumstances  save the proceeding  The more difficult question is whether a court is empowered  in reliance on s  b  of the Act  to amend a bankruptcy notice once it has been visited with invalidity in the circumstances of the present case reversedSkouloudis v St George Bank Ltd   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  On   June   I heard an application for  and granted the appellant  leave to appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court  Raphael FM  on   February   Skouloudis v St George Bank Ltd   FMCA    Leave was necessary because the judgment appealed from was interlocutory  s  A  Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   the FCA Act   Prior to the hearing on   May   Spender ACJ made a determination pursuant to s  A  of the FCA Act that it was appropriate for the appellate jurisdiction of the Court in relation to the appeal to be exercised by a single judge  Accordingly  on granting the appellant leave to appeal  I immediately proceeded to hear the appeal   In the judgment below  his Honour ordered the amendment of Bankruptcy Notice No  NN   of    the Bankruptcy Notice  pursuant to an interim application filed on   January   by the respondent  The amendments included the reduction of the amount claimed in the Bankruptcy Notice from     to     because of amounts received by the respondent prior to the issue of the Bankruptcy Notice that reduced the amount owing by the appellant to the respondent   On   July   judgment was ordered by the Supreme Court of New South Wales in favour of the respondent against the appellant in the amount of     plus costs

the rate prescribed from time to time  By reason of clause  b  of Schedule   of the Civil Procedure Act   all the interest is taken to have accrued under s   of that Act   The respondent received the

cth HCA  html  In Seovic   FCR  the Full Court ultimately held that the letter of   May   from the debtor s solicitors to the creditor s solicitors did not constitute a notice within the meaning of s   of the Act  Nevertheless  they considered the effect of a debtor s notice under s   of the Act and made the following observations    We have observed that s   of the Bankruptcy Act appears to be drafted on the assumption that a bankruptcy notice is liable to be  invalidated  if the sum specified in the notice exceeds the amount in fact due to the creditor  In Re Walsh     ALR     Lockhart J challenged this assumption  by holding that under the Bankruptcy Act  an over statement of the amount due by the debtor does not necessarily vitiate the bankruptcy notice  His Honour considered     that the bankruptcy notice would be avoided only if the over statement could reasonably mislead the debtor  He said he would decline to follow Re a Debtor and Re Prossimo if they stood in the way of this conclusion    In Re Greenhill  Ex parte Myer  NSW  Ltd     FCR     Morling J declined to follow Re Walsh and held that an over statement in a bankruptcy of the amount actually due renders the notice invalid  whether or not the over statement could reasonably mislead the debtor  Morling J considered that observations by the High Court in Walsh v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR       were inconsistent with Lockhart J s analysis  A similar view was subsequently taken by Pincus J in Re Emerson  Ex parte Wreckair Pty Ltd     ALR   at      affirmed on other grounds  Emerson v Wreckair Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    FC     We have acted on the assumption  not challenged by either party  that Re Greenhill and Re Emerson correctly state the law  However  our view would not be changed if Lockhart J s decision in Re Walsh were ultimately found to be correct  as to which we express no view    That assumption is supported by the observation  albeit obiter   of Gibbs CJ in Walsh v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at   There is no doubt that a bankruptcy notice will be invalid if the sum specified in the notice as the amount due to the creditor exceeds the amount for which the creditor is entitled to issue execution  provided that the debtor gives timely notice under s    of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth  as amended  that he disputes the validity of the notice on that ground   with whom Mason  Brennan  Deane and Dawson JJ agreed   It is important  in my view  that the section uses the word  unless  and not  until   In other words  invalidity of the bankruptcy notice does not only run from the time of the giving of the s   notice  once a s   notice is given  invalidity is visited upon the bankruptcy notice from the time of its issue
