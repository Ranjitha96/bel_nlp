decision of the Tribunal  SZJZS v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FMCA     The Appellant now appeals to this Court against the decision of the Federal Magistrate  He appeared before the Court unrepresented  albeit with the assistance of an interpreter  Previously filed on his behalf were written submissions   The two Grounds of Appeal as set forth in the Notice of Appeal are expressed as follows  without alteration  GROUNDS     The Honorable Federal Magistrate erred in considering that the Refugee Review Tribunal  the Tribunal  made a jurisdictional error not following the obligation u s  A of the Migration Act     the Act   The Federal Magistrate wrongly agreed witht the written submissions provided by Ms wong in paragraph    Because the Court gave an opportunity to applicant to respond the documents issue   but the Tribunal did not give any opprtunity to the applicant to respond any issues  Absence of Tribunal hearing transcript can not be the reason to reject the genuine claim      The Honorable Federal Magistrate erred in finding that the Tribunal denied the applicant natural justice when the Tribunal did not arrange  Pakistani Pushto Language Interprator  and this issue was rejected only that there was no transcript of the Tribunal hearing before the Court and the Court wrongly agreed in paragraph   with the respondednt followedTobasi v Minister for Immigration

au cases cth FCAFC  html  Even if the Appellant could overcome the initial difficulty encountered by reason of an interpreter in fact being made available  and even if there is a relevant difference as between an Afghani and a Pakistani Pushto interpreter  he nevertheless faces two further difficulties  namely   i  an absence of any indication that any deficiency in the translation facilities in fact provided before the Tribunal deprived him of an opportunity to present his case  and    ii  the fact that any deficiency in the provision of translation facilities in the Pushto language does not address the Appellant s ability to speak English  as noted by the Tribunal     The onus in judicial review proceedings remains upon an applicant to make out the ground of review upon which he wishes to proceed  cf VAAD v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at   per Hill  Sundberg and Stone JJ  That onus was not discharged before the Federal Magistrates Court in
