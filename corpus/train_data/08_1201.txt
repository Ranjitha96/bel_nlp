And again the rules contain limiting conditions  cf Airservices Australia v Transfield Pty Ltd   FCA       FCR    Finn J there made the following observations as to the features of both rr   and   of O  A    I would emphasise at the outset the following features of these rules  First  while r   for obvious reasons allows discovery against a person whether or not that person is a possible respondent to the projected proceeding  the discovery available under r   is limited to discovery against the person who is the  prospective respondent   Secondly  as has been emphasised by judges of this Court  r   prescribes significant limiting conditions to be satisfied before an order can be made    An applicant who can satisfy them  is allowed  to fish  for the purpose of ascertaining whether he has a case against the prospective respondent    But preliminary discovery cannot itself be used to remedy deficiencies in the satisfaction of the conditions themselves  It does not mandate mere rummaging through another s affairs  Thirdly  while an applicant does not have to make out a prima facie case for the purpose of satisfying the r  a  condition that he or she has reasonable cause to believe he or she has a right to obtain relief    an applicant will not necessarily be denied preliminary discovery because he or she  already has available evidence establishing a prima facie case for the granting of relief     Fourthly  an order for discovery under r   can properly be characterised as an interlocutory order    Fifthly  in Kirella Pty Ltd v Hooper   FCA         FCR       ALR

s   of The Criminal Code  Qld  which authorised the issue of a search warrant and observed at     A search warrant thus authorizes an invasion of premises without the consent of persons in lawful possession or occupation thereof  The validity of such a warrant is necessarily dependent upon the fulfilment of the conditions governing its issue  In prescribing conditions governing the issue of search warrants  the legislature has sought to balance the need for an effective criminal justice system against the need to protect the individual from arbitrary invasions of his privacy and property  Search warrants facilitate the gathering of evidence against  and the apprehension and conviction of  those who have broken the criminal law  In enacting s   the legislature has given primacy to the public interest in the effective administration of criminal justice over the private right of the individual to enjoy his privacy and property  The common law has long been jealous of the prima facie immunity from seizure of papers and possessions  see Holdsworth  A History of English Law  vol     pp      Except in the case of a warrant issued for the purpose of searching a place for stolen goods  the common law refused to countenance the issue of search warrants at all and refused to permit a constable or government official to enter private property without the permission of the occupier  Leach v Money     State Tr     Entick v Carrington     State Tr    Historically  the justification for these limitations on the power of entry and search was based on the rights of private property  Entick     State Tr  at p    In modern times  the justification has shifted increasingly to the protection of privacy  see Feldman  The Law Relating to Entry  Search and Seizure   pp      State and Commonwealth statutes have made many exceptions to the common law position  and s   is a far reaching one  Nevertheless  in construing and applying such statutes  it needs to be kept in mind that they authorize the invasion of interests which the common law has always valued highly and which  through the writ of trespass  it went to great lengths to protect  Against that background  the enactment of conditions which must be fulfilled before a search warrant can be lawfully issued and executed is to be seen as a reflection of the legislature s concern to give a measure of protection to these interests  To insist on strict compliance with the statutory conditions governing the issue of search warrants is simply to give effect to the purpose of the legislation       The importance of the

 Marney v Manifold   HCA         CLR    Menzies J there observed at   I now turn to the pleadings to determine what are the matters at issue between the parties  because discovery is a procedure directed towards obtaining a proper examination and determination of these issues  not towards assisting a party upon a fishing expedition  Only a document which relates in some way to a matter in

 html  As a matter of principle  the common law has long been   jealous of the prima facie immunity from seizure of papers and possessions   George v Rockett   HCA         CLR    Mason CJ  Brennan  Deane  Dawson  Toohey  Gaudron and McHugh JJ were there addressing s   of The Criminal Code  Qld  which authorised the issue of a search warrant and observed at     A search warrant thus authorizes an invasion of premises without the consent of persons in lawful possession or occupation thereof  The validity of such a warrant is necessarily dependent upon the fulfilment of the conditions governing its issue  In prescribing conditions governing the issue of search warrants  the legislature has sought to balance the need for an effective criminal justice system against the need to protect the individual from arbitrary invasions of his privacy and property  Search warrants facilitate the gathering of evidence against  and the apprehension and conviction of  those who have broken the criminal law  In enacting s   the legislature has given primacy to the public interest in the effective administration of criminal justice over the private right of the individual to enjoy his privacy and property  The common law has long been jealous of the prima facie immunity from seizure of papers and possessions  see Holdsworth  A History of English Law  vol     pp      Except in the case of a warrant issued for the purpose of searching a place for stolen goods  the common law refused to countenance the issue of search warrants at all and refused to permit a constable or government official to enter private property without the permission of the occupier  Leach v Money     State Tr     Entick v Carrington     State Tr    Historically  the justification for these limitations on the power of entry and search was based on the rights of private property  Entick     State Tr  at p    In modern times  the justification has shifted increasingly to the protection of privacy  see Feldman  The Law Relating to Entry  Search and Seizure   pp      State and Commonwealth statutes have made many exceptions to the common law position  and s   is a far reaching one  Nevertheless  in construing and applying such statutes  it needs to be kept in mind that they authorize the invasion of interests which the common law has always valued highly and which  through the writ of trespass  it went to great lengths to protect  Against that background  the enactment of conditions which must be fulfilled before a search warrant can be lawfully issued and executed is to be seen as a reflection of the legislature s concern to give a measure of protection to these interests  To insist on strict compliance with the statutory conditions governing the issue of search warrants is simply to give effect

    FCR    Finn J there made the following observations as to the features of both rr   and   of O  A    I would emphasise at the outset the following features of these rules  First  while r   for obvious reasons allows discovery against a person whether or not that person is a possible respondent to the projected proceeding  the discovery available under r   is limited to discovery against the person who is the  prospective respondent   Secondly  as has been emphasised by judges of this Court  r   prescribes significant limiting conditions to be satisfied before an order can be made    An applicant who can satisfy them  is allowed  to fish  for the purpose of ascertaining whether he has a case against the prospective respondent    But preliminary discovery cannot itself be used to remedy deficiencies in the satisfaction of the conditions themselves  It does not mandate mere rummaging through another s affairs  Thirdly  while an applicant does not have to make out a prima facie case for the purpose of satisfying the r  a  condition that he or she has reasonable cause to believe he or she has a right to obtain relief    an applicant will not necessarily be denied preliminary discovery because he or she  already has available evidence establishing a prima facie case for the granting of relief     Fourthly  an order for discovery under r   can properly be characterised as an interlocutory order    Fifthly  in Kirella Pty Ltd v Hooper   FCA         FCR       ALR   Tamberlin J held that the provisions of O  A do not infringe the constitutional requirement that for this

the Applicants  in light of the conclusions reached as to the limits of the right of inspection permitted by the Federal Court Rules   It may be noted that in Lifetime Investments Pty Ltd v Commercial  Worldwide  Financial Services Pty Ltd   FCA   an order was made for the return of documents to the solicitor of a party apparently   to facilitate completion of discovery      Subject to the return of those documents which have no continuing relevance to the proceeding  it is not however considered that the remaining documents seized should be returned    at least at this stage  No case has sought to be advanced by those from whom the documents were seized that the continued retention of those documents is causing them any inconvenience or prejudice  In the absence of any such contention  and notwithstanding the fact that a copy of the documents seized remains available to the Court  it is presently considered that the documents seized should remain available pending the resolution of the proceeding   Pursuant to the terms of the orders made  records have also been kept of those who have inspected the seized documents and materials  Citic Pacific should be provided with a copy of

parts of the Documents and Materials listed above   The Amended Statement of Claim as now filed is a lengthy document which essentially pleads four causes of action  being   a  breach of an equitable duty of confidence   b  breach by the First  Second  Third and Fourth Respondents of employment consultancy agreements and confidentiality agreements   c  breach of fiduciary duty by the First Respondent  and   d  infringement of copyright by all Respondents    As recounted in the reasons for decision when first making the order under O  B   Metso Minerals v Kalra   FCA     the First and Second Respondents were former employees of the First Applicant  Metso Minerals  Australia  Ltd  The Third Respondent was a contractor to the First Applicant and employed the Fourth Respondent  When making the order  the case being advanced against the Respondents was that there had been a breach of the duties and the agreements now pleaded  The Respondents were said to now be employed with the   Citic Group of companies   a competitor of the Applicants  The Fifth Respondent is said to be a company under the control of the First Respondent  Mr Kalra   The search order as first made and as subsequently varied  the Respondents maintain  was relevantly made in advance of the detailed Amended Statement of Claim being filed and the Defences being filed  Those pleadings  they contend  define the ambit of the dispute between the parties and the ambit of evidence relevant or potentially relevant to the resolution of that dispute   The Applicants want to continue to access the materials seized as an aid to the discovery process and in order to be able to further particularise their claims  Although not expressed in these terms  the application is presumably an application for leave to inspect  or to continue to inspect  the documents as envisaged by Practice Note     Leave to continue to inspect the seized documents for the purposes identified is said by the Applicants to be desirable   in the interests of the administration of justice   and as a means to promote good   case management   citedMetso Minerals  Australia  Ltd v Kalra  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au

Minerals  Australia  Ltd v Kalra  No     FCA    By consent  the parties  legal representatives were granted photocopy access to the hard copies of documents seized  Various other orders were thereafter made by consent in February and March   including orders extending the time for reporting by the independent solicitor   On   April   the Applicants sought to further vary the orders made  A contested hearing followed  On   April   orders were made that  relevantly  permitted the Applicants  solicitors to disclose documents to named officers of the Applicants  It was that variation which prompted the intervention in the proceeding of Citic Pacific on   April    That company claimed that amongst the materials seized were documents which they believed may have contained their own documents  being documents which they believed may well have been commercially confidential and possibly privileged  The access regime  as varied  was consequently suspended   Given the description of the   documents and materials   to be seized  such a contention was perhaps unexpected  Certainly when initially making the order  there then was no reason to believe that such documents as would be seized would potentially include the documents of Citic Pacific  or related entities   The very description of the documents and materials that were the subject of the order was an attempt to confine the seizure of materials to those belonging to the Applicants  being materials that improperly remained in the possession of their former employees and contractor  the then Respondents  The seizure of any documents and materials falling outside of the terms of the order obviously would not have been authorised   As occurred in the present proceeding  where there is no longer a basis for believing that documents may be destroyed  O  B cannot then be invoked as the source of a power to vary orders previously made  Thereafter  if those orders are to be varied  recourse must be had to O   r   of

interests of the administration of justice      and other than the competing submission that the Applicants should not be given leave to pursue inspection for the purposes relied upon    none of the

Menzies J there observed at   I now turn to the pleadings to determine what are the matters at issue between the parties  because discovery is a procedure directed towards obtaining a proper

sufficient if it would  or would lead to a train of enquiry which would  either advance a party s own case or damage that of his adversary   See also  Compagnie Financiere et Commerciale du Pacifique

   QBD   at          The nature and extent of disclosure  in terms of the adjectival  relevance  of documents for the purposes of a general order for discovery in its traditional form is explained in Halsbury s Laws of England  th ed  Vol   at   to the following effect      So long as they are likely to throw light on the case  documents  relate to a matter in question  whether or not admissible in evidence    A document may be  relevant  for discovery purposes by reason of its character  ie it is a document of a particular type  or by reason of its contents    Discovery will not be ordered in respect of an allegation not made in the pleadings or particulars  nor will discovery be allowed to enable a party to  fish  for witnesses  or for a new case  ie to enable the party to frame a new case    Each case must be considered according to the issues raised  but where there are numerous documents of slight relevance and it would be oppressive to produce them all  some limitations may be imposed    The foregoing is also an accurate description of Australian practice and procedure  see  generally  Commonwealth of Australia v Northern Land Council     FCR   at          Under a traditional general discovery order  the following methods are available to obtain further disclosure where a party seeks to show that  relevant  documents have been omitted from the list    It may require verification of the list    It may apply for a further and better list  whether verified or not  either in general terms  or limited to certain classes of documents   The power to order a further and better list is parallel with  and may be combined with  the court s power  on application  to order the disclosure of particulars of specific documents     It may apply for an affidavit as to specific documents or classes of documents    In certain special circumstances  it may apply for leave to interrogate as to particular documents  Halsbury  op  cit  at       His Honour there

it was under the former Peruvian Guano test  cf The Compagnie Financi re et Commerciale du Pacifique v The Peruvian Guano Co     QBD    Practice Note   para   states      To prevent orders for discovery requiring production of more documents than are necessary for the fair conduct of the case  orders for discovery will ordinarily be limited to the documents required to be disclosed by Order   rule        Consistent with the more confined extent of discovery which is required  the Federal Court Rules now confer an express power to limit discovery and to make orders   necessary to prevent unnecessary discovery   O   r   followedThermax Ltd v Schott Industrial Glass Ltd   FSR   The extraordinary nature of such relief was not put in issue by any of the parties or Citic Pacific  Nor could

outside the terms of the order as made and as varied  should be returned to the persons from whom they were seized   I  ntrusions into personal privacy and commercial confidentiality   should be minimised  cf Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman License Holdings Ltd   FCA   at       FCA       ALR   at   per Wilcox J citedUniversal Thermosensors Ltd v Hibben     WLR   Practice Note   stresses the importance of the role played by the   independent solicitor   and the qualified right of access of an applicant to the documents seized  It thus provides in part as follows     The independent solicitor is an important safeguard against abuse of the order  The independent solicitor must not be a member or employee of the applicant s firm of solicitors  The independent solicitor should be a solicitor experienced in commercial litigation       Ordinarily  the applicant is not permitted  without the leave of the Court  to inspect things removed from the premises or copies of them  or to be given any information about them by members of the search party   The importance of the role potentially to be played by an   independent solicitor   with appropriate experience has long been recognised  eg Universal Thermosensors Ltd v Hibben     WLR   at   per Nicholls VC  And  as Practice Note   makes clear  the applicant is not to inspect the seized documents   without the leave of the Court     What is not set forth in Practice Note     and perhaps not surprisingly  is the basis upon which leave may be given  The bases upon which leave may be given should perhaps not be confined  Much may depend upon the circumstances of an individual case and much may also depend upon the precision with which the documents and materials that are authorised to be seized can be identified at the outset  Certainly  Practice Note   does not seek to confine the bases upon which leave may be granted or the purpose to be achieved in granting an applicant access to seized documents   When the order was first made pursuant to O  B  there had previously been filed an Application on   December    A Statement of Claim was first filed on   April    Again  in retrospect  directions should have been made for the filing of a Statement of Claim at a far earlier date  A specification by Senior Counsel for the Applicants of the proposed causes of action  albeit a fairly detailed exposition  should not have been endorsed by the Court as an appropriate way to proceed
