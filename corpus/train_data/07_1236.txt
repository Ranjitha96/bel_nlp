Forest v Queensland Health   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAlexander v Home Office     All ER   In this case  the submission of the applicant is that the damage caused to the applicant was in the form of hurt feelings  humiliation and embarrassment suffered as a result of the unlawful discriminatory behaviour on the part of the respondent  Both Mr O Gorman SC and Mr Murdoch have referred me in this respect to comments of May LJ in Alexander v Home Office     All ER   at    Although the comments of his Lordship in that case were referable to a claim for racial discrimination  nonetheless they are in my view of assistance in the case before me     As with any other awards of damages  the objective of an award for unlawful racial discrimination is restitution  Where the discrimination has caused actual pecuniary loss such as the refusal of a job  then the damages referable to this can be readily calculated  For the injury to feelings  however  for the humiliation  for the insult  it is impossible to say what is restitution and the answer must depend on the experience and good sense of the judge and his assessors  Awards should not be minimal  because this would tend to trivialise or diminish respect for the public policy to which the  Act  gives effect  On the other hand  just because it is impossible to assess the monetary value of injured feelings  awards should be restrained  To award sums which are generally felt to be excessive does almost as much harm to the policy and the results which it seeks to achieve as do nominal awards  Further injury to feelings  which is likely to be of a relatively short duration  is less serious than physical injury to the body or the mind which may persist for months  and in many cases for life  citedCatholic Education Office v Clarke   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Clearly each case turns on its own facts  and Counsel acknowledged that damages

submissions of the applicant in relation to these outstanding issues may be summarised as follows         The courts have ordered apologies to be made in appropriate circumstances      Damages should be compensatory and not punitive  Damages in this case should be decided in a manner akin to general principles laid down in Haines v Bendall   HCA         CLR   and Hall v Sheiban Pty Ltd     FCR        In particular  the Court may order a respondent to pay damages by way of compensation for hurt feelings  humiliation and embarrassment suffered by the applicant as a result of unlawful discriminatory behaviour on the part of the respondent  In assessing the damages payable  in this case it is of relevance that     a  the applicant has a psychiatric disability   b  the applicant was unable to access the respondent s health services on a number of occasions  something that would obviously cause distress to a person with the applicant s medical condition and needs   c  the discrimination on the part of the respondent resulted in the applicant being unable to utilise the assistance of his dogs when he wished to access the respondent s services  even though the dogs assisted the applicant to alleviate the effects of his disability   d  there was wilful disregard of the applicant s rights by the respondent   e  the respondent is a State government  and therefore should exhibit exemplary behaviour   f  the applicant had little option but to accept the behaviour treatment dealt out to him by the respondent   g  the hurt suffered by the applicant continues almost three years after the events in question          Although each case turns on its own facts  a case such as Clarke v Catholic Education Offic e     ALR   is of some guidance   There is no

no order should be made in this respect      With respect to an order for damages  the following issues are relevant     a  on   November   the applicant was not seeking to access  health services  but rather was seeking to collect a document he had previously requested   b  on only one of the five occasions that are the subject of the complaint concerning Smithfield Community Health Centre did the applicant leave the Centre without receiving dental treatment  Accordingly  it is not the case that he was unable to access health services or was denied such access   c  the real issue for the applicant was that he was denied something he perceived to be his right   d  there is no basis to submit that there was a wilful disregard of the applicant s rights by the respondent   e  there is no evidence that the applicant continues to feel hurt   f  it does not follow that the respondent did not act in an exemplary fashion          The authorities relied on by the applicant do not support the award of an amount as high as   and the majority of the cases relied upon by the applicant can be distinguished because  for example  in this case there is no suggestion of any personal injury  nor was the respondent s conduct malicious  Relevant comparators are Sheehan v Tin Can Bay Country Club   FMCA     Grovenor v Eldridge   FCA   and McNamara v Golonaise Pty Ltd   QADT         The evidence does not support a finding that the applicant was  publicly humiliated  particularly in relation to events at Smithfield Community Health Centre      Given the bona fides of the respondent
