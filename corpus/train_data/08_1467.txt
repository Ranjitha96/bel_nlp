Anakin Pty Ltd v Chatswood BBQ King Pty Ltd  Corrigendum dated   October     FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredAustralian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It is a question of fact for the Court to decide whether in fact there is such a reasonable probability of deception or confusion that the use of the new mark should be restrained   Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR      Australian Woollen Mills    per Dixon and McTiernan JJ at     In Australian Woollen Mills at   Dixon and McTiernan JJ in a joint judgment explained  In deciding this question  the marks ought not  of course  to be compared side by side  An attempt should be made to estimate the effect or impression produced on the mind of potential customers by the mark or device for which the protection of an injunction is sought  The impression or recollection which is carried away and retained is necessarily the basis of any mistaken belief that the challenged mark or device is the same  The effect of spoken description must be considered  If a mark is in fact or from its nature likely to be the source of some name or verbal description by which buyers will express their desire to have the goods  then similarities both of sound and of meaning may play an important part  The usual manner in which ordinary people behave must be the test of what confusion or deception may be expected  Potential buyers of goods are not to be credited with any high perception or habitual caution  On the other hand  exceptional carelessness or stupidity may be disregarded  The course of business and the way in which the particular class of goods are sold gives  it may be said  the setting  and the habits and observation of men considered in the mass affords the standard  Evidence of actual cases of deception  if forthcoming  is of great weight   In arguing that its use of the words  Chatswood BBQ King  in their context did not constitute the use of a sign or mark that is deceptively similar to the Trade Mark  the respondent placed particular reliance on the following differences between the logo of the Chatswood restaurant and the Trade mark         i  the inclusion of the word  Chatswood   ii  the absence of the  crown  device   iii  the absence of any stylisation of the words   iv  the absence of words in which letters are separated by periods   v  the inclusion of Chinese characters generally and certain Chinese characters in particular   vi  the emphasis on the particular Chinse character which is stylised in a circle   vii  the use of capital letters in the word  KING   viii  the absence of periods between the letters  BBQ   ix  the different font of the English lettering   x  the arrangement of signage in two lines  and   xi  the distinctive colour scheme of red on a yellow background   The above factors would be of significance were it appropriate to compare the marks side by side  However  as mentioned above  it is not appropriate to do so  I am required first to form a view as to the impression produced on the minds of customers and potential customers by the Trade Mark including by the pronunciation of words in the mark  It is then necessary for me to make a judgment as to the likelihood that the form of the respondent s logo would cause them to form the mistaken belief  at a time when the logo is not before them  that the respondent s logo is the Trade Mark  I am to be concerned with the usual way in which ordinary people behave  I should disregard those with high perception or habitual caution and also those of exceptional carelessness or stupidity consideredBeecham Group Plc v Colgate Palmolive Pty Ltd     IPR   As Crennan J observed in Christodoulou v Disney Enterprises Inc   FCA         FCR   at     the test enunciated by Kitto J in the Shell Co case has been adopted many times including by the Full Court in Pepsico Australia Pty Ltd  t as Frito Lay Australia  v Kettle Chips Company Pty Ltd     ALR   where  at     Sackville J conveniently collected the authorities  Crennan J at   explained  The test involves consideration of the context in which the allegedly infringing use occurs  This can encompass factors such as the positioning of the sign  the type of font  the size of words or letters and the colours which are used  as well as how the sign is applied to advertising materials or the packaging of the goods in relation to other features  for example  see the analysis of Emmett J in Beecham Group Plc v Colgate Palmolive Pty Ltd   FCA   at       with respect to the use of the term  MaxClean  used on toothbrushes   In Beecham Group Plc v Colgate Palmolive Pty Ltd     IPR   at   Emmett J observed  The prominence and positioning of the MaxClean sign on the packaging of the toothbrush and in promotional material  together with the font size  styling  colour and shading of the MaxClean sign  suggests even greater significance than the  Colgate  brand  Other products  of both Colgate and its competitors  position distinguishing names that are properly characterised as sub brands in the same place as the MaxClean sign appears in relation to Colgate on the packaging and leaflet  The distinctive styling  colouring and shading has a graphic element akin to a logo  The distinctive blue and white colouring  with a halo effect of white shading around the words  is also indicative of use as a trade mark  rather than as a merely descriptive phrase  Although the  C  appears in upper case  there is no space between the  X  and the  C   That suggests an invented word intended for use as a trade mark   Except in respect of the  polo  style shirt  I consider the critical issue for present purposes to be the respondent s use of its logo as a whole  not its use of the words  Chatswood BBQ King   The distinctive colouring and layout of the respondent s logo and the prominence with which it is displayed at and near the restaurant s entrance and on the restaurant s menu cover are such that  in my view  a person seeing them would conclude that the respondent used its logo to distinguish its food and services from those offered by others   I conclude that the respondent s logo generally  and because of its obvious derivation from that logo  the sign on the  polo  style shirt  each has the character of a brand which the respondent uses for the purpose of indicating a connection in the course of trade between the respondent s restaurant and related services and the respondent  I am therefore satisfied that the respondent uses each of its logo and the sign on the  polo  style shirt  as a trade mark  consideredBlount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Section   of the Trade Marks Act was intended to ameliorate the test under the   Act and  in particular  to allow registration of a trade mark that was shown to be distinctive in fact of the applicant s goods or services  see Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR   at       Having regard to such of the evidence identified in     below as existed as at   October   I am satisfied that  as at that date  because of the extent to which the applicant  or its predecessor in title  had used the Trade Mark before that date  it did distinguish the goods and services of the applicant  I am so satisfied notwithstanding that the evidence discloses that  as at   October   there were other restaurants and businesses in the greater Sydney area and elsewhere that were trading under names that included the words  BBQ King  citedBritish Sugar Plc v James Robertson   Sons Ltd   RPC   Under the Trade Marks Act    Cth   the   Act  it was clear that certain marks could never be regarded as entitled to registration even though they were  as a matter of

observed with respect to the   Act in Clark Equipment Company v Registrar of Trade Marks at       It is undeniable that a mark which  considered by itself  would seem unadapted to that purpose  ie distinguishing the applicant s goods from those of others      may yet come by actual use or by virtue of special circumstances to be so closely associated with the applicant s goods in the minds of the relevant public that its apparently disqualifying signification is effectually obscured  and distinctiveness in fact is thus achieved  But although such a measure of practical success with the mark may well provide a sufficient foundation for a passing off action  the Trade Marks Act does not accept it as necessarily sufficient for the special protection which it affords to registered trade

Trade Practices Commission     ALR   I am persuaded that it is appropriate for an order to be made restraining the respondent from using the name  Chatswood BBQ King  as the name of  or otherwise in connection with  the respondent s restaurant  However  I am not persuaded that the restraint should extend to the use of the individual words and phrases  BBQ King   BBQ Kings   BBQ   King  and  Kings   Rather  in my view  the appropriate approach is that exemplified by the injunction ultimately made in Turner v General Motors  Australia  Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   which was discussed in Commodore Business Machines Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission     ALR   at    In Turner v General Motors  Australia  Pty Ltd the defendants were restrained  from using the words  General Motor  or  General Motors  in connection with any business then or thereafter carried on by them or any of them without clearly distinguishing such business from the business carried on by General Motors  Australia  Pty Ltd and from using any name calculated to lead persons to believe that the said business or businesses or any business of the defendants was or were identical or connected with the business of the plaintiff and also from representing or holding out to the like effect   As to the appropriate form generally of an injunction  including an injunction in an intellectual property case  see Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd v Sharman Networks Ltd   FCAFC         FCR   at        consideredConagra Inc v McCain Foods  Aust  Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In Conagra Inc v McCain Foods  Aust  Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at   Gummow J  sitting as a member of the Full Court  observed that  Within the passing off action  there is an accommodation and adjustment of three competing interests  First that of the plaintiff in protecting the commercial advantages flowing from his efforts and investment  secondly that of the defendant in being free to attract purchasers for his goods and services by what appears to him to be an effective means  and thirdly that of consumers in selecting between competing goods and services without the practice upon them of misrepresentations   Anakin and Gold Kings  claim for damages for infringement of trade mark fails  see   above   For this reason claims made by Anakin and Gold Kings for damage to the value of the Trade Mark and for loss of the ability to licence others to use the Trade Mark are not of themselves sustainable  This is probably of limited significance in view of my finding that the claims for damages for passing off and pursuant to s   of the Trade Practice Act succeed  The tort of passing off is concerned to prevent unfair competition and thus damage to a trader s goodwill   Conagra Inc v McCain Foods  Aust  Pty Ltd per Lockhart J at    Section   provides for the recovery by a person who suffers loss or damage by conduct of another person done in contravention of s   or s   of that Act of the amount of that loss or damage  The following consideration of the damage allegedly suffered by Anakin and Gold Kings is limited to their claims for passing off and under the Trade Practices Act    Anakin and Gold Kings alleged that they have lost the opportunity to make a profit on the sale of cooked meat to the respondent s restaurant  The evidence does not support this allegation  There is no reason to conclude that if the respondent had not engaged in conduct inconsistent with the norms established by s   and s   of the Trade Practices Act it would have purchased cooked meat from Anakin or Gold Kings or one of them   Mrs Chau gave evidence that in about June   she and her son had discussed opening BBQ King restaurants in Epping and Chatswood  She did not indicate whether she envisaged that these suburban restaurants would be operated by one or other of the applicants or  like the BBQ King Express outlets  by PAAC Group Pty Ltd which is not an applicant in this proceeding  No other director of an applicant gave evidence on this topic  It is conceded by the applicants that no steps have been taken by any of them to open a BBQ King restaurant in Epping  I am therefore sceptical about Mrs Chau s suggestion that a BBQ King restaurant has not been opened in Chatswood because to do so would create confusion with the respondent s restaurant  I am not satisfied that conduct of the respondent has resulted in Anakin or Gold Kings  or either of them  losing the opportunity to open additional BBQ King restaurants   The applicants submitted that it can reasonably be inferred that the custom of the Chatswood restaurant includes the custom of persons who know of the BBQ King restaurant and  being under a misapprehension that the Chatswood restaurant is associated with the BBQ King restaurant  eat at the Chatswood restaurant rather than travel to the city to eat at the BBQ King restaurant  I accept that this inference should be drawn  First  I am satisfied that the respondent decided to operate its restaurant under the name Chatswood BBQ King because it considered that by doing so it might benefit from the reputation of the BBQ King restaurant  I see no reason to assume that its judgment in this regard was not correct  see Conagra Inc v McCain Foods  Aust  Pty Ltd per Lockhart J at   and the cases there cited   The evidence adduced by the applicants from customers who assumed a connection between the BBQ King restaurant and the respondent s restaurant provides support for this approach   Precise evaluation of the damage suffered by Gold Kings by reason of the respondent s conduct is impossible  As mentioned above  the respondent s restaurant opened on   September    A comparison of Gold Kings  trading accounts for the years ending   June   and   June   reveal that both its trading income and its gross profit from sales enjoyed a modest increase in the financial year in which the respondent s restaurant opened  A comparable increase in gross profit from sales in comparison with the previous year had been achieved by Anakin in the financial year ending   June     The financial records of the respondent indicate that it has traded at a loss since opening its restaurant in Chatswood  It is  however  probably more significant for present purposes to concentrate on its gross profit on trading in the two years for which its financial records are available  Its trading statement for the year ending   June   shows gross profit on trading of      Its trading statement for the year ending   June   shows gross profit on trading of      I infer that its gross profit on trading for the year ending   June   would probably have also shown a modest increase over the previous year and thus have been in the order of   consideredDent v Moore   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I interpolate that at     below I deal with the respondent s submission that the receipt into evidence of the Sale Agreement is prohibited by s   of the Duties Act    NSW   the   Act    It is sufficient here to record that  in my view  s   does not  as a matter of construction  do more than render an unstamped instrument that effects a dutiable transaction inadmissible to prove any fact giving the instrument its taxable character  I have reached this view after giving consideration to authorities concerning the equivalent prohibition in the English Stamps Acts  As the High Court observed in Dent v Moore   HCA         CLR   at     until   the prohibition in the English Acts had used the language  admitted to be good  useful  or available in law or equity   In Matheson v Ross   EngR         H L C    the House of Lords accepted that if the facts provided by the instrument were one which  even if it were stamped  would be foreign to its taxable character  the document could be used for that purpose  Although it may be a borderline situation  it seems to me that  to the extent that the Sales Agreement evidences Bar B Q King Restaurant Pty Ltd s ownership of the BBQ King restaurant as at the date of the Sale Agreement  it falls outside the terms of s   consideredEOS Australia Pty Ltd v Expo Tomei Pty Ltd     IPR   In EOS Australia Pty Ltd v Expo Tomei Pty Ltd     IPR   I expressed the view that the terms of s   of the Trade Marks Act tend to suggest that s   does not vest a true discretion in a prescribed court   Subsequently  in Health World Ltd v Shui Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR   Jacobson J at     observed  The power to order rectification under s   is expressed in discretionary terms  However  in EOS Australia Pty Ltd v Expo Tomei Pty Ltd     IPR   at   Branson J expressed the view that the terms of s   suggest that s   does not vest a true discretion in the court  In my opinion  there is force in Branson J s view because s   is subject to s   and s   confers a discretion  to be exercised in limited circumstances  not to grant an application for rectification  Nevertheless  this approach has not been taken in other courts  see  for example  Toddler Kindy Gymbaroo Pty Ltd v Gymbaree Pty Ltd     FCR       IPR       FCA   at     Mayne Industries Pty Ltd v Advanced Engineering Group Pty Ltd     IPR       FCA   at     Lahore observes at   that s   may be seen as codifying the case law on blameworthy conduct  accordingly  it deals with the circumstances in which a particular discretion may be exercised without detracting from the general discretion found in s    I propose to proceed on that basis   Little guidance as to the proper application of s   can be obtained from Toddler Kindy Gymbaroo Pty Ltd v Gymboree Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   as no party argued in that case that s   did not vest a true discretion in a prescribed court  In Mayne Industries Pty Limited v Advanced Engineering Group Pty Limited   FCA         IPR   at   Greenwood J said of s   of the Trade Marks Act  Section   confers a discretion on the court to order cancellation of the registration of the trade mark  That discretion is to be exercised according to its terms and  where appropriate  settled principle  The discretion is to be exercised subject to s   which identifies circumstances in which the court might decide not to make an order  Similarly  the court might by s   of the Act decide  not to grant an application under s   and therefore refuse to make an order which  is itself  an exercise of the discretion  if the registered owner satisfies the court that the ground relied on by the applicant  has not arisen through any act or fault of the registered owner   In terms  the discretion must not only be exercised taking account of ss   and   but having regard to the effect of s   on the right of the registered owner of the trade mark  It seems to me that all these matters must be weighed carefully in the balance to determine whether the court ought to cancel the registration of a trade mark and  in consequence  extinguish rights conferred by the Act on the registered owner  The discretion is a true discretion in the sense that all the matters going to s    the circumstances of this case  must be considered  the particular circumstances of the applicant  any relevant s   factors  the conduct of the registered owner and the effect upon the rights of the registered owner brought about by the operation of s    Some of these factors will weigh heavily as s   for example  has the applied effect of declaring that the registered owner has no exclusive rights  In that sense  the discretion may seem facultative only  EOS  Aust  Pty Ltd v Expo Tomei Pty Ltd     IPR     per Branson J  However  the court is required to determine whether an order ought to be made or refused taking account of the identified considerations consideredFCT v Murry   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The respective financial records of Mempoll and Anakin provide support for Mr Yip s evidence that Mempoll did not sell the goodwill that it purchased from Bar B Q King Restaurant Pty Ltd  or any later generated goodwill in the BBQ King restaurant  to Anakin  As mentioned above  Mempoll s financial records for as late as   June   continue to show as a non current asset goodwill at cost in the amount of      However  the fact that Mempoll did not sell the goodwill to Anakin and continued to show that goodwill as an asset in its accounts is not  in my view  conclusive as to the ownership of that goodwill  In FCT v Murry   HCA         ALR   at   the majority of the High Court approved the observation of Barwick CJ in Geraghty v Minter   HCA         CLR   at   that  goodwill is not something that can be conveyed or held in gross  it is something that attaches to a business  It cannot be dealt with separately from the business with which it is associated    The respondent contended that Anakin was not at the time of the application for registration  ie on   October   the owner of the Trade Mark  As appears above  I am satisfied that as at   October   the BBQ King restaurant business was owned and operated by Gold Kings and not by Anakin  see    I am also satisfied that  notwithstanding the retention in Mempoll s accounts of the goodwill that it purchased under the Sale Agreement  as at   October   Gold Kings owned the goodwill in the trade mark  BBQ King   The evidence makes plain that at this time Gold Kings had and exercised the right to conduct the BBQ King restaurant business  in substantially the same manner and by substantially the same means that  had previously  attracted custom to it   see FCT v Murry at     I conclude that Anakin was not the owner of the Trade Mark at   October     As I am satisfied that Anakin was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at   October   it is not strictly necessary for me to reach a conclusion on whether the Trade Mark was then capable of distinguishing the applicant s goods or services from the goods or services of other persons  s   of the Trade Marks Act    However  lest the matter go further  I record that  if the issue of ownership is left to one side  I am satisfied that the Trade Mark is to be taken to have been capable of distinguishing the applicants  goods and services citedFinance Facilities Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  A reading s   of the   Act in the context of the Act as a whole suggests that the word  may  is not intended to vest a discretion in the Chief Commissioner but rather that it indicates the circumstances in which the power is to be exercised   Finance Facilities Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   per Windeyer J at      As s   of the   Act  the equivalent of s   of the   Act   makes plain  a failure by the Chief Commissioner to stamp a dutiable instrument in accordance with s   could cause serious harm to a party to that instrument and  indeed  to others   I conclude that the stamp on the Sale Agreement upon which the applicant s rely is insufficient to allow me to conclude that the Sale Agreement is  duly stamped  within the meaning of s   of the   Act   it neither indicates that the instrument is not liable to duty nor that a specific amount of duty has been paid and the document is duly stamped  Nonetheless  as recorded above  I am satisfied that a cheque drawn by Mempoll in favour of the Office of State Revenue was sent to that office in intended payment of an amount of stamp duty in respect of the Sale Agreement   No party advanced submissions touching on whether s   of the   Act constrains the admissibility of evidence in the Federal Court  see s   of the Judiciary Act    Cth  and s   of the Evidence Act    Cth   I shall therefore proceed on the assumption  but without so deciding  that the section does constrain the admissibility of evidence in this Court  Nonetheless I do not draw the conclusion that the Sale Agreement is inadmissible to prove the facts giving rise to its taxable character  ie the sale and purchase of the business of the BBQ King Restaurant   The applicants  by their counsel  have indicated that they are willing to transmit the instrument to the Chief Commissioner in accordance with arrangements approved by the Court  s  a   I will hear counsel as to appropriate arrangements in this regard  My present inclination is that an appropriate arrangement would be for the instrument to be transmitted to the Chief Commissioner together with a complete copy of these reasons for judgment consideredGeraghty v Minter   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The respective financial records of Mempoll and Anakin provide support for Mr Yip s evidence

ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  As I have concluded above  the phrase  BBQ King  does for a great many people identify the restaurant which operates under that name in Goulburn Street  Haymarket  Once the respondent chose to adopt a name so close to that of the Goulburn Street restaurant it came under an obligation to take care to ensure that its restaurant was adequately distinguished from it  see Kettle Chip Company Pty Ltd v Apand Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR   at   and the cases there cited   It did not do so  As noted above  by placing a geographic indicator  Chatswood  before the phrase  BBQ King  the respondent created a name apt to convey the message to an English speaking customer that its restaurant was the Chatswood branch or outlet of the BBQ King

observed in Christodoulou v Disney Enterprises Inc   FCA         FCR   at     the test enunciated by Kitto J in the Shell Co case has been adopted many times including by the Full Court in Pepsico Australia Pty Ltd  t as Frito Lay Australia  v Kettle Chips Company Pty Ltd     ALR   where  at     Sackville J conveniently collected the authorities  Crennan J at   explained  The test involves consideration of the context in which the allegedly infringing use occurs  This can encompass factors such as the positioning of the sign  the type of font  the size of words or letters and the colours which are used  as well as how the sign is applied to advertising materials or the packaging of the goods in relation to other features  for example  see the analysis of Emmett J in Beecham

edu au au cases cth HCA  html  For the following reasons the circumstances of this case do not render it necessary to determine the extent  if at all  to which the above authorities differ on the issue of the proper approach to the exercise of the power of a prescribed court to order that the Register be rectified  I am satisfied that the respondent is  an aggrieved person  within the meaning of s   as it is  as I have found  using as a trade mark a logo that is deceptively similar to the Trade Mark  see      The respondent has applied by its cross claim for an order that the Register be rectified by cancelling the registration of the Trade Mark on a ground identified in s  a   That ground has been made out  see   above   In the circumstances it seems to me that the respondent is entitled to an order that the Register be rectified by cancelling the registration of the Trade Mark unless sufficient reason appears for leaving it there  see Re Carl Zeiss Pty Ltd s Application   HCA         CLR   per Kitto J at    For the reasons that follow I am not satisfied that sufficient reasons appear for leaving the registration in place   The applicants  submissions on the issue of the Court s discretion under s   were premised on the assumption that if the Court were to find that Anakin was not the owner of the Trade Mark at the critical time  its finding would be that Mempoll was the owner of the Trade Mark  I have in fact concluded that Gold Kings was the owner of the Trade Mark at the critical time  Should that conclusion be wrong  it would seem necessary to conclude that the ownership of the Trade Mark remains with Mempoll as its financial statements suggest  It is therefore appropriate to read the applicants  submissions as set out below on the basis that the references to Mempoll should also  indeed should primarily  be understood as references to Gold Kings  The applicants submit that the following should be taken into account in the beneficial exercise of the Court s discretion not to cancel or remove the Trade Mark       a  the applicants and the persons standing behind the applicants apprehended that Anakin s use of the Trade Mark entitled it to be registered as owner           b  Mempoll did not object to the use of the Trade mark by Anakin  nor its application for registration of the Trade Mark           c  substantially the same persons own and control each of Mempoll and Anakin           d  there is no real public interest served in cancelling the registration           e  there is no useful purpose to be served by removing the Trade Mark from the Register simply for the purpose of  in effect  compelling a fresh application to be made  The Trade Mark  newly registered  but with additional expense would remain within the same group of companies and persons and be used in relation to the same restaurant services      The Trade Mark as registered should be preserved as an established mark associated with a business that has existed for over   years and which is well known to the public   footnotes omitted  After giving the matter anxious consideration I have concluded that  having regard to the totality of the evidence before me  it is not appropriate to refrain from ordering that the Register be rectified by cancelling the registration of the Trade Mark  To do otherwise would  as it seems to me  be to allow the applicants to benefit from the  informal  way in which their affairs have been handled  see   above   Whether or not the applicants so intended  this informality has resulted  as the evidence suggests  in failures to comply with requirements of the Corporations Act and earlier legislation concerning the proper operation of companies  see Ch  G of the Corporations Act    It has also resulted in failures  as the evidence suggests  to comply with the requirements of the   Act with  as I infer  appreciable loss of revenue to the State of New South Wales  see Part   of the   Act    The applicants did not offer any acceptable explanation of these failures consideredReckitt   Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc     WLR   At the same page his Honour noted that attempts to produce a definition of the tort which is both succinct and comprehensive have had mixed success  Nonetheless  both Lockhart and Gummow JJ in that case referred with approval to the following passage from the speech of Lord Oliver of Aylmerton in Reckitt   Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc     WLR   at   in which his Lordship identified the elements that a plaintiff must prove in order to succeed      First  he must establish a goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or services which he supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by association with the identifying  get up   whether it consists simply of a brand name or a trade description  or the individual features of labelling and packaging  under which his particular goods or services are offered to the public  such that the get up is recognised by the public as distinctive specifically of the plaintiff s goods or services  Secondly  he must demonstrate a misrepresentation by the defendant to the public  whether or not intentional  leading or likely to lead the public to believe that goods or services offered by him are the goods or services of the plaintiff  Whether the public is aware of the plaintiff s identity as the manufacturer or supplier of the goods or services is immaterial  as long as they are identified with a particular source which is in fact the plaintiff  For example  if the public is accustomed to rely upon a particular brand name in purchasing goods of a particular description  it matters not at all that there is little or no public awareness of the identity of the proprietor of the brand name  Thirdly  he must demonstrate that he suffers or  in a quia timet action  that he is likely to suffer damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the defendant s misrepresentation that the source of the defendant s goods or services is the same as the source of those offered by the plaintiff   See also Vieright Pty Ltd v Myer Stores Ltd     IPR   at   citedRegistrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths   FCA         IPR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  For the purposes of the Trade Marks Act  a trade mark is taken to be deceptively similar to another trade mark if it so nearly resembles that other trade mark that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    The use of the word  likely  does not import a requirement that it be more probable than not that the trade mark has that effect  it is sufficient that the probability of deception is finite and non trivial   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths   FCA         IPR   per French J at   consideredS   I Publishing Pty Ltd v Australian Surf Life Saver Pty Ltd     FCR   In S   I Publishing Pty Ltd v Australian Surf Life Saver Pty Ltd     FCR   at     the Full Court restated a number of applicable principles where conduct claimed to be misleading or deceptive involves what is said to be a misrepresentation as follows  There will be no contravention of s   unless the error or misconception which occurs results from the conduct of the corporation and not from other circumstances for which the corporation is not responsible       Conduct will be misleading and deceptive if it leads into error       Conduct will be likely to mislead or deceive if there is a  real or not remote chance or possibility  of misleading or deceiving regardless of whether it is less or more than        Conduct causing confusion or uncertainty in the sense that members of the public might have cause to wonder whether the two products or services might have come from the same source is not necessarily misleading and deceptive conduct       In a case such as the present an applicant must establish that it has acquired the relevant reputation in the name or get up such that the name or get up has become distinctive of the applicant s business or products       Conduct may be misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive notwithstanding that the corporation said to engage in that conduct acted honestly and reasonably and did not intend to mislead or deceive       Nevertheless  where the intention to mislead or deceive is found  it logically would be likely that a court would more easily find that the conduct was misleading or deceptive       It is unnecessary in the present case to consider the question whether a finding of intention to mislead or deceive can have relevance in other ways to issues such as remedies  In many cases it will be necessary to consider the class of persons to whom the representation was directed       There is no proposition of law to the effect that intervention from erroneous assumption between conduct and misconception destroys the necessary chain of causation with the consequence that the conduct cannot be regarded as likely to mislead or deceive       The test of whether conduct is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive is an objective one for the Court to determine  It is ultimately a question of fact consideredShell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited     CLR   The relevant test was articulated by Kitto J in Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited     CLR    the   Shell Co case   It is helpful to understand the context in which his Honour articulated the test  Esso Standard Oil was the proprietor of registered trade marks for a caricature of a man described as a  humanised oil drop   It alleged that the Shell Company had infringed its registered trade marks in two advertising television films which included an animated oil drop character  An issue for determination on the appeal was whether the Shell Company s use of the oil drop character constituted a use of the characters as a trade mark  At   Kitto J said      the question becomes whether  in the setting in which the particular pictures referred to were presented  they would have appeared to the television viewer as possessing the character of devices  or brands  which the appellant was using or proposing to use in relation to petrol for the purpose of indicating  or so as to indicate  a connexion in the course of trade between the petrol and the appellant  Did they appear to be thrown onto the screen as being marks for distinguishing Shell petrol from other petrol in the course of trade  Kitto J concluded that the oil drop character had not been used by the Shell Company  as a trade mark   His Honour noted that the connection in the films between the oil drop man and the petrol he symbolised was a connection  limited by the purpose of the occasion   He observed that the only purpose in the appearance of the oil drop man was to unite a quickly moving series of pictures which conveyed a message about the qualities of Shell petrol  Kitto J considered it  quite certain  that no viewer would pick out any scene including the oil drop man and say   There I see something that the Shell people are showing me as being a mark by which I may know that any petrol in relation to which I see it used is theirs  citedStarr Partners Pty Ltd v Dev Prem Pty Ltd     IPR   In determining whether the respondent s logo is deceptively similar to the Trade Mark I have accorded particular weight to the following factors  First  the respondent s logo adopts the whole of the word element of the Trade Mark  The pronunciation of that element will sound identical in each case  A comparison based on sound is of particular relevance in this case because restaurant custom is commonly based on word of mouth recommendation  Secondly  the word element of the Trade Mark is a prominent feature of the respondent s logo  Although it is appropriate to have regard to the impression produced by the respective marks in their entirety  some features of a mark can be more striking and memorable than others   Starr Partners Pty Ltd v Dev Prem Pty Ltd     IPR   at    To a customer or potential customer literate only  or principally  in English  the English word element of each mark will be of dominant significance  The additional English word in the respondent s mark  ie  Chatswood  is apt to be understood as a geographic indicator  For this reason it is likely to create in a potential customer s mind the impression of connection with the Trade Mark rather than serve as a distinguishing feature  that is  it is likely to be understood as suggesting that this is the Chatswood outlet or branch of the owner of the Trade Mark  This aspect of the respondent s sign assumes particular significance because of the reputation of the registered mark which is discussed below   Starr Partners Pty Ltd v Dev Prem Pty Ltd at     I accept the applicants  submission that the use of different fonts and  in the one case  upper case lettering  does not avoid the likelihood of deception  The differences are not marked and the words convey the same message  That message is not to be determined by giving separate consideration to  BBQ  and  King  but rather by giving consideration to them as a composite phrase   I conclude that the respondent s logo is deceptively similar to the Trade Mark  It necessarily follows that the sign on the  polo  style shirt is deceptively similar to the Trade Mark citedTaco Company of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd     ALR   I accept that the likelihood of Chinese speaking customers being misled into believing that there is a business relationship between the BBQ King restaurant and the Chatswood BBQ King restaurant is significantly less high than in the case of English speaking customers  However  I do not accept that the relevant section of the public by reference to which the question of whether the respondent s conduct is misleading or deceptive falls to be tested is Chinese speaking residents of Chatswood  or indeed  Sydney  see Taco Company of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd     ALR   at      The relevant section of the public in this case is potential customers of the goods and services of the two restaurants and includes in each case significant numbers of English speaking customers  The evidence concerning the actual customers of the BBQ King restaurant is that they are predominantly English speaking  The evidence concerning the actual customers of the respondent s restaurant is that there are  more  Chinese than English speakers  I did not gain the impression from this evidence that English speaking customers do not form an appreciable part of the clientele of the respondent s restaurant   In my view the evidence supports a finding that there is a real chance or possibility of customers being misled or deceived by the name of the respondent s restaurant  Indeed  as noted above  I consider it more likely than not that the name of the respondent s restaurant was selected because Mr Liang appreciated the possibility that customers might be led to believe that the restaurant was associated with the BBQ King restaurant consideredToddler Kindy

established  it will be so by reason of a finding of a misrepresentation of the type discussed in the authorities  Such a misrepresentation will usually constitute a contravention of s   and possibly s     of the Trade Practices Act   Conversely  if no misrepresentation is found  it will usually follow that the Trade Practices Act claim will also fail   As mentioned above  the BBQ King restaurant was established under that name in about    Since at least about   the name  BBQ King  has been prominently displayed on a sign outside the restaurant  It has operated under that name in Goulburn

the use to be in good faith imports an absence of intention to make use of the goodwill which has been acquired by another trader  The resemblance between the registered trade mark  of which the first respondent was aware and the name of the first respondent does not prevent the use being bona fide provided that there was an honest belief that no confusion would arise and if there were no intention of wrongfully diverting business      Evidence of such an honest belief is necessary to establish  bona fide use      citations omitted  I accept that the name of the respondent s restaurant was suggested by Yu Xi Liang  a director and shareholder of the respondent  Mr Liang gave affidavit evidence that he suggested the name  Chatswood BBQ King  for the following reasons       a  Chatswood BBQ Kitchen has previously operated at the site of the respondent s restaurant   b  the location was therefore already known as an outlet for Cantonese roast meats   c  the word  King  described the superior and top quality of the respondent s BBQ and in Chinese the character for  King  can also be used to convey  excellence   top quality  or  the best  and   d  the word  Chatswood  identified the location of the business   The credibility of Mr Liang s above evidence was seriously undermined by his cross examination  Under cross examination Mr Liang eventually accepted that he had chosen the name of the respondent s restaurant before identifying the Chatswood site as the location of the restaurant  Although he initially claimed that he had chosen the English name of the restaurant  as per request from the council  when challenged he conceded that he had chosen the respondent s name before he spoke with the council  I consider it appropriate to approach Mr Liang s assertion that  f or us this English name is very casual  with scepticism
