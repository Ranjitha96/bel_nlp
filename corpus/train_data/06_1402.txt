Industries PLC     IPR     AIPC       FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlOn   March   Branson J delivered reasons for judgment in two proceedings  N  of   which related to Patent Application No   and N  of   which related to Patent Application No    Each was an  appeal  against a decision of a delegate of the Commissioner of Patents  Du Pont was the  appellant  in each case and ICI was the respondent in each case  ICI being the applicant for each patent and Du Pont the unsuccessful opponent in each case  Two  appeals  were heard together and decided at the same time in the same set of reasons   E I Dupont de Nemours   Co v Imperial Chemical Industries PLC     IPR     AIPC       FCA    The description of the invention in the complete specification commences       The present invention relates generally to working fluid compositions contained in heat transfer devices which comprise the lubricant and a heat transfer fluid  Branson J dealt with the claims as follows  at        All of the claims defining the invention are concerned with a  working fluid composition   Claim   is the only independent claim   It is expressed as follows       A working fluid composition comprising           A  a heat transfer fluid comprising a mixture of at least two hydrofluoroalkanes selected from the group consisting of difluoromethane    tetrafluoroethane and pentafluoroethane  and    B  a lubricant which is at least partially soluble in each component of the heat transfer fluid said lubricant comprising one or more compounds of general formula      O         R O C R     n         wherein     R is the hydrocarbon radical remaining after removing the hydroxyl groups from pentaerythritol  dipentaerythritol  tripentaerythritol  trimethylol ethane  trimethylol propane or neopentyl glycol  or the hydroxyl containing hydrocarbon radical remaining after removing a proportion of the hydroxyl groups from pentaerythritol  dipentaerythritol  tripentaerythritol  trimethylol ethane  trimethylol propane or neopentyl glycol    each R   is  independently  H  a straight chain  linear  aliphatic hydrocarbyl group  a branched aliphatic hydrocarbyl group  or an aliphatic hydrocarbyl group  linear or branched  containing a carboxylic acid or carboxylic acid ester substituent  provided that at least one R   group is a linear aliphatic hydrocarbyl group or a branched aliphatic hydrocarbyl group  and     n is an integer        emphasis added On   December   an examination report issued on the Divisional Application raising the following objection           The invention defined by the claims lacks novelty in the light of     AU     to The Lubrizol Corporation   This citation was ruled in the Federal Court judgment as rendering the parent of the current application not novel  It is noted that the specification of the current application is identical to the parent document    See E I DuPont de Nemours   Co v Imperial Chemical Industries PLC   FCA   in particular paragraphs   to      Note  In the light of the above the Commissioner is considering refusing this application under s     You will be contacted early in the new year to arrange a date for a hearing into the matter  referred toImperial Chemical Industries PLC v EI Dupont De Nemours   Co   AIPC       FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThat leave was refused by the Full Court on   August     Imperial Chemical Industries PLC v EI Dupont De Nemours   Co   AIPC       FCAFC    In the course of the judgment  the Full Court said  at          The primary judge found that integer  A  of Claim   of the Lubrizol Patent anticipated integer  A  of PA   Integer  A  of the Lubrizol Patent requires that the liquid composition must comprise  in addition to a minor amount of a lubricant  a major amount of at least one hydrocarbon that contains both fluorine and one or two carbon atoms  Integer A of PA   requires that the composition will comprise  in addition to a lubricant  a mixture of at least two hydrofluoroalkanes selected from        difluoromethane        tetrafluoroethane     pentafluoroethane     An alkane is a fully saturated carbon or hydrocarbon chain  That is to say  there are as many hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon atoms as possible and only single bonds exist between the carbon atoms  Thus  the specification states that each of the above three compounds is a fully saturated hydrocarbon chain  Each of them contains fluorine and each contains one or two carbon atoms  Thus  difluoromethane contains two fluorine atoms and one carbon atom  Tetrofluoroethane contains four fluorine atoms and two carbon atoms  Pentofluoroethane contains five fluorine atoms and two carbon atoms  Clearly  each of those compounds is encompassed by the description   fluorine containing hydrocarbon containing one or two carbon atoms    Thus  the use of a liquid composition described in Claim   of PA  is clearly disclosed by the Lubrizol Patent    There is no suggestion in the complete specification of PA  that a liquid composition comprising a refrigerant that satisfies the description in integer  A  and a lubricant that satisfies integer  B  would be any more effective than  or perform a function different from  a composition comprising a major amount of at least one fluorine containing hydrocarbon containing one or two carbon atoms and the lubricant described in integer  B  of Claim   of the Lubrizol Patent  That is to say  PA  is not an instance of the selection of something disclosed by the Lubrizol Patent by way of a further inventive step  It is no more than a particular example of the invention disclosed by the Lubrizol Patent    It is  therefore  crystal clear that a patent granted pursuant to PA   would be revocable  The correctness of that conclusion by the primary judge is attended with no doubt  Accordingly  there would be no utility in granting leave to appeal from her Honour s orders in relation to PA   In the circumstances  it is not necessary to consider the other ground upon which her Honour concluded that the opposition to PA   should succeed  In the meantime  on   March   ICI filed a Divisional Application of Application   under No    Divisional Applications are provided for by s  B of the Patents Act  At that stage it was in identical form to the parent application  No notice of intention to file that Divisional Application was given to either Du Pont or the Court  The proceeding had been stood over by Branson J on   March   to   April   for submission of draft orders followedImperial Chemicals Industries Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents     ALR       IPR     AIPC    On   October   ICI appealed against that decision to the Court and the matter came on before Crennan J  Du Pont sought leave to appear before Crennan J as amicus curiae and submitted that it was an abuse of process for ICI to reargue before Crennan J a matter decided by Branson J  Leave was refused   Imperial Chemical Industries Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents     ALR       IPR     AIPC     at    The matter proceeded in the absence of Du Pont  On   December   it was ordered that the appeal be allowed  that the decision of the delegate be set aside and that the matter be remitted to the delegate to reconsider the application and amendments proposed by the applicant in accordance with the Court s reasons for judgment  see Imperial Chemicals Industries Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents     ALR       IPR     AIPC     at

hand  and any issue for determination in the present application  on the other  there can be no issue estoppel   Kuligowski v Metrobus   HCA         CLR   at          I cannot see that the questions raised by Du Pont as to the propriety of the filing of the Divisional Application by ICI have any relevance to establishing the issue estoppels pleaded  The proceeding should be dismissed  The

cth FCA  htmldiscussedRe Application by Imperial Chemical Industries PLC     IPR  On   April   ICI proposed amendments to the specification which had the effect that claim   of the Divisional Application would be as follows         A working fluid composition comprising           A  a heat transfer fluid comprising a mixture of difluoromethane    tetrafluoroethane and pentafluoroethane  and    B  a lubricant which is at least partially soluble in each component of the heat transfer fluid said lubricant comprising one or more compounds of general formula     formula follows       That claim is similar in scope  although not in form  to claim   of the Parent Application and is similar to claim   of Application    A delegate of the Commissioner refused the Divisional Application on the basis it lacked novelty and refused an opportunity to propose further amendments  One ground of that decision was that there was an issue estoppel created by the judgment of Branson J but for the fact that the parties were not the same    Re Application by Imperial Chemical Industries PLC     IPR
