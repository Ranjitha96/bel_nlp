Wright Rubber Products Pty Ltd v Bayer AG  No     FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAuskay International Manufacturing   Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn a case such as the present where an applicant alleges the existence of a global market or a market extending beyond the bounds of Australia  but which includes Australia  it is necessary that that market be identified in any pleading  It is a material fact or particular  see Auskay International Manufacturing   Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Ltd   FCA         ALR   at    The pleadings must identify the relevant goods or services  the geographic boundaries of the market and those involved in close competition within the market whom it is said have engaged in anti competitive conduct  A single market will thus be identified  which will include a  market in Australia   The applicant has pleaded that there is a global market for the supply of rubber chemicals and an Australian market for those products  The particulars refer to the global market and how elements of that market extend to Australia  For example  the particulars sub joined to paragraph   include the information that the  total demand for rubber chemicals in Australia in the Cartel Period was approximately AUD  million   That demand was met exclusively by imports  the majority of which were produced elsewhere by the Respondents and one other company  Reliance was also placed  in the particulars subjoined to paragraph   to a passage in the Rubber Chemicals World Data Book   which refers to  a single global market   Reference was made to findings by the European Commission  in December   that cartel arrangements involving the respondents and others led  after   to agreed increases of prices on a global and  multi regional  basis referred toAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v April Marketing Services Australia Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlCounsel for the applicant conceded that this part of the applicant s case is pleaded  at a level of generality  but contended that  the best available particulars have been provided and the core allegations are clear   Reliance was placed on the decision of Bennett J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v April Marketing Services Australia Pty Ltd   FCA   which was said to be  an analogous ACCC cartel claim   I am not persuaded that the pleadings with which her Honour was concerned in April Marketing were analogous  except perhaps in a very broad sense  with those in the present case  Nonetheless Bennett J s reasons  especially at   and   do emphasise the need for applicants to be accorded some leeway in pleading cartel cases  She was prepared to allow the applicant to plead conclusions and defer the provision of particulars until after discovery  Although the relevant pleadings in April Marketing were not set out in her Honour s reasons  there is nothing to suggest that they did no more than paraphrase or adapt relevant statutory provisions  Due allowance must be made for the fact that the cartel agreements were  it may be assumed  negotiated in secrecy by the representatives of the corporate entities involved  The applicant was  of course  not privy to these discussions and the arrangements to which they gave rise  Despite this  the applicant has been able to draw on a large amount of information which has emerged from foreign proceedings in which regulatory authorities have brought participants in the cartel to account for their conduct  It has been able to prepare the detailed material in Schedule   to its amended statement of claim  The particulars of   meetings between employees of the relevant companies are itemised in that Schedule  This material includes the relevant dates  participants  locations and the subject matter of each meeting  The existence and inclusion of this material begs the question   if such detailed information is already available to the applicant  why were the pleadings not more specific Paragraphs   to   are central to the pleading  Some modest attempts have been made to improve the drafting since my earlier reasons were published  Nonetheless  the principal deficiencies  earlier identified  remain such that these four

meaning of a  market in Australia  in the context of s   of the TPA  Significantly  his Honour held  at   that           the definition of  market in Australia  in s  E excludes a market that is wholly outside Australia  a conclusion with which I respectfully agree   In my opinion  Hill J in Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd v IBM Global Financing Australia Ltd   FCA     Riverstone   was correct in concluding that the fact that a market was global did not signify that there could not be a market in Australia for the same products  or services   Emirates and the other authorities to which I have referred make it clear that  simply because a market is global  this does not mean that there could not be a market in Australia for the same products  The applicant s pleading is not  in my view  deficient by reason only that it speaks of the respondents being in competition with each other in the Australian market and throughout the world  There may be a market in Australia which forms part of a wider global market  That will  however  be the case only if the same firms are in close competition with each other to attract customers for their goods in both the global market and the Australian market which forms part of the global market  Unfortunately  the applicant does not plead sufficient material facts for the respondents to know clearly whether the applicant is alleging the existence of a global market  of which a market in Australia forms part  or whether it is alleging the existence of a market in Australia and a global market in which  for example  different or additional firms compete for business  The problem is compounded by the variable and imprecise phraseology to which attention has been drawn in paragraph   above  Although the applicant s most recent attempt to identify a market in Australia has remedied some of the defects in its original statement of claim  further refinement will be necessary before the necessary degree of precision is achieved  Foreign respondents giving effect to the arrangements in Australia In paragraphs   to   of the original statement of claim the applicant alleged  in the most general terms  that the foreign respondents gave effect to the cartel arrangements in Australia  There was a notable absence of material facts to establish this part of the applicant s case  In addition  the separate causes of

the arguments of Esso to a greater extent than I have in my view the Court s individual docket system of case management and its ability to ensure that the proceeding is conducted in a manner which

Australia Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe applicant submits that its definition of  the Australian market  is sufficient and not productive of confusion  notwithstanding the later references to a global market for the supply of the same rubber chemicals  It relies on the decision of Hill J in Riverstone Computer Services Pty Ltd v IBM Global Financing Australia Ltd   FCA   at   to support the proposition that a  global market is a market in Australia if the goods or services are supplied  here   In Riverstone   Hill J was dealing with an application for pre action discovery  All he was called on to determine  on an interlocutory basis  was whether there existed reasonable cause to believe that the applicant had or may have had a right to relief against the respondent  His Honour found that the evidence supported the existence of a global market for new and second hand computers and rejected a submission that  simply because no reference was made in the affidavits relied on by the applicant to an Australian market for these products  no such market existed  His Honour said  at   that       A global market which includes Australia  and the inference is that any global market did  is arguably a market in Australia if sales are made here  and the evidence shows they are  even if that market might also exist in the United States  Japan  China or any other country which was a member of the European union   emphasis added   Hill J is not  therefore  to be understood as defining a  market in Australia  simply by reference to the fact goods or services which are supplied elsewhere in the world are also supplied in Australia  Riverstone does no more than support a general principle that there may  for TPA purposes  exist a market in

orders striking out the original statement of claim  see Wright Rubber Products Pty Ltd v Bayer AG   FCA    my earlier reasons   The shortcomings of this original pleading fell into two broad categories  first  that the applicant had failed to identify with sufficient precision the group members whom it wished to represent  and secondly  that the applicant had failed to plead sufficient material facts to establish a cause of action  More particularly  I identified the following deficiencies in the original statement of claim  Group definition  Potential group members would have had difficulty ascertaining whether they were members of the group because of the difficulty in determining whether they had bought  Rubber Products  The definition of  Rubber Products  was inadequate  which in turn affected the entire statement of claim  and The applicant had not pleaded sufficient material facts to establish that it was a member of the group it sought to represent  The Cartel Arrangements  The discrete causes of action arising under sub paragraphs  i  and  ii  of s  a  of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   the TPA  had not been pleaded separately  Identification of the Markets  The pleading confused references to the global and Australian markets  referring to the global market at times and the Australian market at other times without explaining why  The pleading did not clearly establish the existence of an Australian  as distinct from a global  market  and There were inconsistencies as to whether the market was for  Rubber Chemicals  or  Rubber Products   Giving effect to the arrangements in Australia I granted leave to the applicant to replead its statement of claim  It has done so  The respondents  other than the fourth respondent  complain that the amended statement of claim is also fatally flawed and should be struck out  They have moved the Court for an order under O   rule   of the Federal Court Rules
