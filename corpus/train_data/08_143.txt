    FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In Al Raied v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA   at   I deprecated the artificiality of a statement such as that

primary decision  the Refugee Review Tribunal review  and judicial review of a child present in Australia who may be in need of asylum for reasons recognised by the relevant Convention   Counsel for the Minister on this appeal was not able to advise me of any steps taken to address the problems identified in SBAH  It is presumably for this reason that officers of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs engaged in correspondence with SZJXW  addressed to her care of her parents  and officers of the Refugee Review Tribunal engaged in correspondence with her directly  including extending to her an invitation to attend a hearing  It would  I respectfully suggest  be in everyone s interest if provision could be made for a more sensible way of dealing with a claim for protection advanced on behalf of an infant   Order   rule   of the Federal Court Rules provides that an infant may sue by his or her next friend  Order   rule   provides that a tutor  which term is defined by O   r   to include a next friend  must act by a solicitor  The tutor must not have an interest in the proceeding adverse to the infant  O   r    This requirement might ordinarily be expected  in any case on which the Minister is the guardian of the infant pursuant to the Immigration  Guardianship of Children  Act    Cth  to disqualify the Minister from assuming the role of next friend  I do not thereby imply that the Minister is the guardian of SZJXW  No submissions were advanced to the Court on that question   In SBAH the Full Court  after considering the provisions of O   of the Federal Court Rules   took the view that an appeal instituted on behalf of an infant by her mother  who had not complied with the requirements of O   r   was not a nullity but that the mother s want of authority meant that the outcome of the appeal would not bind the infant   In Akpata v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA   Mansfield J referred to the judgment of the Full Court in SBAH and to other authorities concerning the situation of a child on whose behalf  and for whose benefit  an adult had commenced a proceeding  Having done so  his Honour

the dispensation granted by his Honour extended to compliance with O   r   followedSZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA   The Federal Magistrate rejected the claim that the Tribunal was obliged to notify SZJXW pursuant to s  A of the Act that it had information  obtained from its own observations  that neither she nor her father had the appearance of persons of Caucasian ethnicity  His Honour relied on SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA   at   in concluding that the Tribunal s observations were not  information  within the meaning of s  A  His Honour was  I consider  right to do so  In any event  as indicated above  the Tribunal rejected for other reasons the claim that SZJXW s father had suffered harm because he had the appearance of a Caucasian  In the circumstances it would be inappropriate to grant the appellant any relief in respect of a breach of s  A of the Act even if it be assumed that there was such a breach   Ground III also fails   The appeal will be dismissed  I will hear the parties as to costs   I certify that the preceding twenty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of
