austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The applicant referred to Adelaide Brighton Cement v AWU   FCA     when faced with similar issues  von Doussa J  after considering Davids Distribution noted at     The degree of specificity in a notice sufficient to enable the employer to take appropriate defensive action must be judged against the nature of the employer s undertaking and the way in which that undertaking operates     In that case  as here  the employer operated   hour day and night shifts and was left not knowing at what time on what day it would need to allocate labour to maintain its operations  His Honour found there was a serious question to be tried that the notice of industrial action failed to meet the requirements of s  MO   now     of the Act   referred toAPRA v CPSU   Anor    June   Print S  In upholding the validity of the notice  the Vice President adopted the approach taken by the Full Bench of the Commission in APRA v CPSU  Print S    That case was an appeal from a decision of Polites SDP and concerned the validity of a notice of initiation of bargaining periods and  in particular  whether  by including an additional employee organisation in the notice  the notice thereby was invalid  Polites SDP had held that the inclusion of another organisation of employees in the notice did not serve to invalidate the notice as between the initiating party and the negotiating party  He also held  assuming that he was wrong concerning the validity of the notice  on that ground  that the inclusion of the other organisation of employees could be severed from the other provisions of the notice and for that additional reason ought not to be regarded as invalidating the notice between the initiating party and negotiating party at     The Full Bench  without more  merely adopted the reasons of Polites SDP in these respects  APRA v CPSU  Print S  at     The applicant contended that       i  protected industrial action can only occur during a bargaining period  ss   and    The Protected Action Notice indicates that employees will take industrial action  in respect of the notice of bargaining period BP    The Initiating Notice was directed to    other negotiating parties   the applicant  the AMWU and CEPU  and stated that the respondent intended to try to make a collective agreement with the other negotiating parties  The particulars  at paragraph  b  of the Protected Action Notice  confirmed that the proposed collective agreement sought in the bargaining period was one binding the applicant  the respondent  CEPU and AMWU           ii  there is no provision in the Act which allows a union to initiate a bargaining period in pursuit of a multi union agreement  Where a union initiates a bargaining period the only other negotiating party is the employer  s   and    The ability to initiate a bargaining period with more than one union is confined to employers  s  c   A defect of this kind is no mere technicality  The effect of a bargaining period is to modify existing legal rights  A union that is a negotiating party may take protected action  s    Severance is not possible because it will substantially alter the nature of the proposed collective agreement sought in the bargaining period  as confirmed by the particulars   The inclusion of the CEPU and AMWU as  Other Negotiating Parties  was not a  slip   Both the particulars and the factual matrix in which the notice was served confirm that the respondent intended to negotiate an agreement with the applicant and the other   unions  The expired CSBP Agreement was an agreement between the applicant and the   unions and  since April   the applicant and the   unions had been negotiating a new agreement to replace the expired agreement  Further  even if the references in the Initiating Notice to the AMWU and CEPU could be severed  it is seriously arguable that the notice would only then be valid so that a bargaining period would not come into effect for a further   days  s   of the Act            iii  whereas a challenge to the validity of the Initiating Notice was rejected by Lawler VP in LHMU v CSBP Limited   AIRC     PR  at     and a similar challenge under the pre reform Act was rejected by a Full Bench of the Commission in APRA v CPSU   Anor     June   Print S  at         those decisions should not be followed  The point which arises in this case  and which was not addressed in those decisions  is not merely that the CEPU and AMWU have been erroneously named as negotiating parties in the respondent s notice  It is that the proposed collective agreement referred to in the Initiating Notice was particularised as  and was intended to be  an agreement between the respondent  the applicant and the CEPU and AMWU and that  by reason of s  d    a union cannot initiate a bargaining period under the Act which would entitle it to take protected industrial action in support of a multi union agreement           iv  under s   of the Act   industrial action organised or engaged in during the bargaining period may be protected action but only if it is organised or engaged in for the purpose of supporting or advancing claims made in respect of  the proposed collective agreement  s    The  proposed collective agreement  is that to which the bargaining period is directed  s   Trinity Garden Aged Care   Anor v ANF     August   PR  at    Accordingly  if the Initiating Notice is held to be valid  the result will be that the respondent will seemingly be entitled to take protected industrial action to cause the respondent to make an agreement with the respondent  the CEPU and the AMWU  Such an outcome is inconsistent with s  d  which clearly evinces an intention that if a bargaining period is to be initiated in pursuit of a multi union agreement  with the possibility that industrial action will then be taken in support of such an agreement  it must be initiated by the employer           v  the contrast with s  c    which expressly allows for more than one organisation to be a negotiating party where the initiating party is the employer  is telling  This is not a curious result  It is quite easy to envisage why Parliament would not have wished to give unions the ability to take industrial action to cause an employer to enter into a multi union agreement  irrespective of the wishes of the employer  It is quite possible that Parliament considered the employer was best placed to determine whether a multi union agreement was suited to the needs of the particular business and therefore that the employer should not be pressured into making a multi union agreement if it did not wish to  The fact that  in the present case  the applicant is prepared to negotiate a multi union agreement is not to the point  What is at issue is the capacity of the respondent union to initiate a bargaining period in pursuit of a multi union agreement  and          vi  if  as appears from s     a union cannot initiate a bargaining period in pursuit of a multi union agreement  there is at least a serious question to be tried that the respondent s Initiating Notice was invalid such that no bargaining period was initiated and the proposed industrial action will be unprotected and unlawful citedAFMEPKIU v ACI Mould Manufacturing   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  It is no answer  in the applicant s submission  to say simply that the only express temporal requirement in s   is that the notice specify the day when the action will begin  The authorities indicate that the purpose of the sub section will not be met unless the action is described with sufficient specificity to enable the recipient of the notice  usually but not always the employer  to take appropriate defensive measures and the degree of specificity required will vary according to the nature of the employer s undertaking and the way it operates  It referred to AFMEPKIU v ACI Mould Manufacturing   FCA    Goldberg J  at      serious question that notice was invalid because it failed to state the end date of proposed action    The respondent submitted that the Protected Action Notice is unambiguous in that the employees in question are those who are members of the respondent and who work as process technicians  there is no uncertainty as to whether the notice relates to some or all of those employees as it obviously relates to all of them   The respondent then contended that the Protected Action Notice specifies that industrial action in the form of the Stoppage will commence on   April and that whilst it does not specify the time it will commence  the Act does not require this to be done  Section   merely requires written notice of  the day  when the intended action will begin

to comply with s   of the Act a notice must describe the nature of the industrial action with sufficient particularity to enable an employer to take appropriate defensive action  Davids Distribution Pty Ltd v NUW   FCA         FCR   at       There are  according to the applicant  two difficulties with the Protected Action Notice  Firstly  the Notice of Action states    The employees to whom this notice relates are those employees of CSBP Limited who are members of the LHMU  who would be subject to the proposed collective agreement dealt with in bargaining period BP  and work as process technicians   The applicant contends that it is ambiguous as to whether some or all of the process technicians  who are members of the respondent  are intended to take the threatened industrial action   The applicant referred to Adelaide Brighton Cement v AWU   FCA     when faced with similar issues  von Doussa J  after considering Davids Distribution noted at     The degree of specificity in a notice sufficient to enable the employer to take appropriate defensive action must be judged against the nature of the employer s undertaking and the way in which that undertaking operates     In that case  as here  the employer operated   hour day and night shifts and was left not knowing at what time on what day it would need to allocate labour to maintain its operations  His Honour found there was a serious question to be tried that the notice of industrial action failed to meet the requirements of s  MO   now     of the Act     I am satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried that the Protected Action Notice does not adequately state the nature of the intended action and was therefore not a valid notice  In Davids Distribution Pty Ltd v NUW   Wilcox and Cooper JJ  with whom Burchett J agreed on this point  said of then s  MO  which was in the same terms as s   of the Act              Parliament did not indicate what degree of specificity it intended by the term  nature of the intended action   To interpret this term  on the one extreme  as requiring no more than an indication of industrial action  as argued by NUW  would be significantly to devalue s  MO  the notice would provide little information  To interpret it  on the other extreme  as requiring precise details of every future act or omission would be to impose on the giver of a notice an obligation almost impossible to fulfil  Industrial disputes are dynamic affairs  Decisions as to future steps often need to be made at short notice  sometimes in response to actions of the opposing party or other people  including governments  and changing circumstances  It would be a major  and unrealistic  constraint on industrial action to require a party to specify  three clear working days in advance  exactly what steps it would take  An unduly demanding interpretation of s  MO  would seriously compromise the scheme of Div   of Pt VIB of the Act   it would be difficult for a party to an industrial dispute to obtain the protection contemplated by the Division              We think s  MO  was designed to ensure that industrial disputants who are to become affected by protected action  in relation to which their usual legal rights are significantly diminished  are at least able to take appropriate defensive action  For example  an employer may operate a sophisticated item of equipment that will be damaged if precipitately shut down  If warned in advance of a ban that might affect the continued operation of that plant  the employer might choose a controlled shut down during the period of the notice  More commonly  perhaps  an employer might use the notice time to communicate with suppliers and customers  and thereby reduce the consequences for them of the notified industrial action  Very often  the recipient of the notice will respond in a way that has a legal dimension  For example  a union might react to a notice by an employer of intent to lockout some employees by giving notice that all employees will strike indefinitely as from the commencement of the lockout  Similarly  an employer might respond to an employees  notice of bans by giving notice of a lockout of some or all employees   The appropriate defensive action referred to by von Doussa J in Davids Distribution Pty Ltd included  by way of example  the shutting down of a sophisticated item of equipment  although in the context of potential damage to the equipment if precipitately shut down  In this case  whatever be the consideration concerning damage to the plant  there are very substantial safety issues concerned both with the shutting down of the plant safely but also in monitoring the plant whilst it is shut down  see the Woodside Petroleum and Burswood Resort cases referred to above  Arguably the Protected Action Notice should have specified the Process Technicians  if any  who would be available for safety duties during the proposed period of the industrial action  Whilst  at the hearing  this safety issue was resolved  by agreement  that fact does not assist the respondent in relation to the question of the efficacy of the Protected Action Notice  a question which falls to be considered in light of the content of the Notice  unaffected by the agreement reached at the hearing before me followedDG Whelan Rentals Pty Ltd v Australian Building Construction Employees  and Builders Labourers  Federation       ALR   I am satisfied that I have such power  DG Whelan Rentals Pty Ltd v Australian Building Construction Employees  and Builders

Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union   Western Australian Branch v CSBP Limited   AIRC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth AIRC  html  The applicant contended in the Commission before Lawler VP that it was not open under the Act for a union to initiate a bargaining period naming other unions as negotiating parties and accordingly it was submitted that the Initiating Notice was invalid and did not initiate a bargaining period  The Commission upheld the validity of the Initiating Notice  Liquor  Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union Western Australian Branch v CSBP Ltd   AIRC    the first Commission case    Lawler VP in so finding said relevantly      It is certainly arguable  as CSBP submits  that the effect of s   is that  while an employer is able to initiate a single bargaining period with more than one union as negotiating parties  see s     where a particular union initiates a bargaining period  only that union and the employer are negotiating parties  see s   and   and that  accordingly  other unions who may wish to be part of the proposed collective agreement with the employer cannot be  negotiating parties  in relation to that particular bargaining period  He continued      To the extent that s   has the effect of preventing a union from initiating a bargaining period in which other unions are negotiating parties  I can see nothing in the legislation that would render invalid a notice by a union initiating a bargaining period merely because it  incorrectly  names other unions as a negotiating party  If s   has the effect for which CSBP contends then those other unions do not in fact become  negotiating parties   in the particular bargaining period initiated by the giving of the notice  notwithstanding that they are named as  negotiating parties  in the notice  However  it does not automatically follow that the notice thereby becomes invalid or otherwise ineffective in initiating a bargaining period to which the employer and notifying union are negotiating parties     Emphasis added    Section   specifies how the bargaining period is initiated  Even if CSBP  as employer  is the only other person who can be a  negotiating party  to a bargaining period initiated by the LHMU in relation to CSBP employees in this case the LHMU gave  written notice     to each other negotiating party and to the Commission stating that the initiating party intends to try to make a collective agreement to which this section applies     with the other negotiating parties under       as required by s    The fact that the notice was also given to other persons as  negotiating parties  does not detract from the fact that the requirements of s   have been satisfied    The protected action ballot order made by Lawler VP was  according to counsel for the respondent  revoked upon the application of the respondent  A further application for a protected action ballot order was then made relying upon the Initiating Notice and came on for hearing before Commissioner Smith of the Commission on   March of this year  The Commissioner in an ex tempore decision made a protection action ballot order  The Commissioner s edited reasons were published on   March   Liquor  Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union v CSBP Limited  PR   the second Commission case   The points taken by the applicant before Lawler VP as to the invalidity of the Initiating Notice were re argued before Commissioner Smith  In his reasons the Commissioner adopted  without more  the reasoning of Lawler VP  in the first Commission case  in finding that there was a valid bargaining period and in effect a valid initiating notice   As of   March   the applicant had reached agreement on all terms of a new workplace agreement with the respondent except in respect of  backpayment of allowances   As at   March those issues were resolved save for issues said to have been specific to chemicals   As at   March   the remaining issues concerned shift cover and chemical operator levels   The applicant contended that       i  protected industrial action can only occur during a bargaining period  ss   and    The Protected Action Notice indicates that employees will

Parliament would not have wished to give unions the ability to take industrial action to cause an employer to enter into a multi union agreement  irrespective of the wishes of the employer  It is quite possible that Parliament considered the employer was best placed to determine whether a multi union agreement was suited to the needs of the particular business and therefore that the employer should not be pressured into making a multi union agreement if it did not wish to  The fact that  in the present case  the applicant is prepared to negotiate a multi union agreement is not to the point  What is at issue is the capacity of the respondent union to initiate a bargaining period in pursuit of a multi union agreement  and          vi  if  as appears from s     a union cannot initiate a bargaining period in pursuit of a multi union agreement  there is at least a serious question to be tried that the respondent s Initiating Notice was invalid such that no bargaining period was initiated and the proposed industrial action will be unprotected and unlawful   In my opinion there is a serious question to be tried as to whether in the circumstances of this case  the Initiating Notice was valid  I am not immediately persuaded  although I make no decision in this regard  that the reasoning of Lawler VP to which I have referred is correct  In any event  as I earlier foreshadowed  his reasons do not deal with the point which has been raised by the applicant here  namely  whether the addition of the CEPU and the AMWU as negotiating parties were included advisedly in the Initiating Notice  not  incorrectly  as Lawler VP assumed  to the end that the proposed collective agreement referred to in the Initiating Notice was intended to be an agreement between the applicant  the respondent and each of the CEPU and the AMWU  This question in turn raises associated questions not dealt with in either the first Commission case or the second Commission case in any determinative way  These are firstly whether upon the proper construction of s  b  of the Act a union can initiate a bargaining period under the Act which would entitle it to take industrial action in support of a multi union agreement  Secondly there is the effect upon the validity of the Initiating Notice having regard to the provisions of s   of the Act which provides relevantly that during a bargaining period an organisation of employees that is a negotiating party is entitled  for the purpose of supporting or advancing claims made in respect of the proposed collective agreement to organise or engage in industrial action against the employer  For the purposes of s   of the Act the  proposed collective agreement  is that to which the bargaining period is directed  Trinity Garden Aged Care v ANF    August   PR  at    On one view  as the applicant submits  this would produce the result that the respondent would similarly be entitled to take protected industrial action to cause the applicant to make an agreement not merely with the respondent but with the respondent and each of the CEPU and AMWU   In any event  whatever the position in relation to the question of issue estoppel as it may concern that particular challenge to the Initiating Notice  there was no issue at any time in the Commission concerning the validity of the Protected Action Notice nor could there have been for the obvious reason that this notice was not given until after the protected ballot order had been made by Commissioner Smith  I will now consider that question   In the alternative  the applicant submits that even if there is a valid bargaining period in place there is a serious question to be tried that the Protected Action Notice given by the respondent on   March   in purported compliance with s   of the Act   did not adequately state the nature of the intended action and was therefore not a valid notice citedWalton v Gardiner   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Alternatively  so the respondent submitted  as a matter of discretion  the applicant should not be permitted to dispute the validity of the notice initiating the bargaining period because that issue has already been decided twice  even if  on a strict application of the doctrine of issue estoppel  it does not apply  It cited in support Spalla v St George Motor Finance Ltd  No     FCA     at     per French J  Walton v Gardiner   HCA         CLR   per Mason CJ  Deane and Dawson JJ at   Sea Culture International Pty Ltd v Scoles     FCR   at   per French J referred toWoodside Petroleum  WA Oil  Pty Ltd v AIMPE   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The applicant relied upon Woodside Petroleum  WA Oil  Pty Ltd v AIMPE   FCA   where a similar issue arose  The notice of intended industrial action served by the union in that case did not make clear whether employees would perform critical safety functions including monitoring of the power supply  The seriousness of the safety issues raised weighed heavily in the balance of convenience    FCA   at         The applicant also referred the Court to Burswood Resort  Management  Ltd v ALHMWU   FCA    Carr J  at      serious question to be tried as to whether  stoppages of work  refers to some or all employees  Burswood Resort  Management  Ltd v CEPU   FCA    Nicholson J  at       The appropriate defensive action referred to by von Doussa J in Davids Distribution Pty Ltd included  by way of example  the shutting down of a sophisticated item of equipment  although in the context of potential damage to the equipment if precipitately shut down  In this case  whatever be the consideration concerning damage to the plant  there are very substantial safety issues concerned both with the shutting down of the plant safely but also in monitoring the plant whilst it is shut down  see the Woodside Petroleum and Burswood Resort cases referred to above  Arguably the Protected Action Notice should have specified the Process Technicians  if any  who would be available for safety duties during the proposed period of the industrial action  Whilst  at the hearing  this safety issue was resolved  by agreement  that fact does not assist the respondent in relation to the question of the efficacy of the Protected Action Notice  a question which falls to be considered in light of the content of the Notice  unaffected by the agreement reached at the hearing before me
