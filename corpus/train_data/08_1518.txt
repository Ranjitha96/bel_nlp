having regard to the root authorities mentioned  in the determination of whether an application has reasonable prospects of success  A question which emerges is whether s  F  like s  C  merely highlights a particular basis for summary dismissal leaving the general law on that subject applicable or whether it  too  should be regarded as providing a unique power of dismissal which  is to be construed and applied according to its terms  not under the influence of  muffled echoes of old arguments  concerning other legislation  Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Ltd   HCA

Tribunal   FCA   at     Hely J remarked of the claim registration regime introduced by Pt   that        The registration test is not a screening mechanism for access to the Federal Court  A claim which is not registered may proceed to determination in the Court  But when a claim is on the Register the applicants are afforded significant procedural rights  including the right to be consulted upon  or to comment  on specific classes of future acts  and the right to negotiate over the grant of mining tenements or compulsory acquisition of the land  Given those statutory benefits  the purpose of the registration test is to ensure that only those claims with merit are registered     Strictly  even after the amendments made by the Technical Amendments Act   it remains true that the registration test found in Pt   is  not a screening mechanism for access to the Federal Court   my emphasis   That is so if for no other reason than that satisfaction of the registration test is not a condition precedent to the ability to file in the Court an application for determination of a native title claim  However  the presence now of s  F  in the Native Title Act and the particular occasion for its engagement provided by s  F  does indicate that satisfaction of the registration test has ramifications for whether an application should be allowed to remain on the Court s list  Further  given that the Act confers the choice of a full right of review by the Court of the registration refusal decision and vests in the Court a discretion as to whether the application should be dismissed  that the registration decision is initially made by an administrative official is not indicative of an impermissible interference by the Executive with the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth  It is s  F  which provides the  screening mechanism  consideredGudjala People     v Native Title Registrar   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The Delegate commenced her consideration of whether the application s factual basis supported the assertions set out in subparas  B a  to  c  by reminding herself of what Mansfield J had said of s   B  of the Native Title Act in Northern Territory v Doepel   FCA         FCR   at       Section  B  is carefully expressed  It requires the Registrar to consider whether the  factual basis on which it is asserted  that the claimed native title rights and interests exist  is sufficient to support the assertion   That requires the Registrar to address the quality of the asserted factual basis for those claimed rights and interests  but only in the sense of ensuring that  if they are true  they can support the existence of those claimed rights and interests  In other words  the Registrar is required to determine whether the asserted facts can support the claimed conclusions  The role is not to test whether the asserted facts will or may be proved at the hearing  or to assess the strength of the evidence which may ultimately be adduced to establish the asserted facts   I note that this particular passage from Doepel s Case was recently expressly approved by the Full Court in Gudjala People     v Native Title Registrar   FCAFC    French  Moore and Lindgren JJ  at    The emphasis evident in the passage quoted is that which the Full Court gave to those words in the Gudjala People     Case  For reasons which will become apparent  it will be necessary later to return to the Full Court s reasons in the Gudjala People     Case   A noteworthy and commendable feature of the submission made by the Applicant s solicitor and of the supporting affidavit evidence was their candour  It was stated in the Applicant s written submission  The Applicant has not yet sought to again amend the Application since the date of the registration test decision  However such a course of action has not been dismissed by the Applicant  The Applicant cannot properly consider its position in this regard until such time as there is further anthropological research undertaken in respect of the claim  The Applicant apprehended that there were two primary reasons why the claim had failed the registration test  As put in the written submission  these were submitted to be       a  The initial decision of Justice Dowsett in The Gudjala People     v Native Title Registrar   FCA   was the applicable law at the time of the registration test   The requirements for registration testing as enunciated in that decision  particularly those as apply to s  B a  and  b  have been softened somewhat by the recent full court decision in that matter    b  There was a lack of material placed before the registration test delegate such that would allow her to satisfy herself as to the requirements of a factual basis to the claim as required by s  B c      sic  Regard to the Delegate s reasons confirms a reference by her to the judgement of Dowsett J in The Gudjala People     v Native Title Registrar in the course of her consideration of the factual basis for the assertions described in s  B a  and  b  but not in her consideration of s  B c   His Honour delivered judgment in that case on   August    There was delay in the institution of an appeal against his Honour s decision  Further  the appeal was not heard until   May   i e  after the Delegate had made her decision  On   August   the Full Court allowed the appeal  At the time when she reached her decision reference by the Delegate to the judgment of Dowsett J in The Gudjala People     v Native Title Registrar was both understandable and appropriate   My assessment of why  having regard to the Delegate s reasons  she decided not to accept the claim for registration accords with that of the Applicant s solicitor   The Applicant s submission  it may be recalled  contended that the Full Court s decision in the Gudjala People     case  supra  had  softened somewhat  the requirements for registration testing  particularly in relation to s  B a  and  b  of the Native Title Act    The relevance of this contention was not developed in the submission   In the Gudjala People     case  supra  at   to     the Full Court offered the following guidance as to the inter relationship between s   of the Native Title Act   which relevantly governs the material to be contained in a claimant application such as the present and the consideration of a claim for registration for which s  A of that Act provides and the ramifications of that inter relationship in terms of satisfaction by the Registrar or the NNTT or the Court on review that the conditions in s  B of the Act are or are not met         A convenient starting point  in considering the correctness of his Honour s approach  is to consider the interaction between s   and s  A in the terms they were in at the time the application was lodged  The former provision prescribes what an applicant must do to commence an application  The latter provision establishes a statutory regime under which the Registrar of the Tribunal assesses the application to determine whether it should be accepted  It is tolerably clear that what the assessment entails is informed by what is required of an applicant to commence an application  Indeed  there is no reason to doubt that this statutory scheme contemplates that it would be open to the Registrar to accept an application based on the application  including the accompanying affidavit  without having regard to other information of the type referred to in s  A   Accordingly  the statutory scheme appears to proceed on the basis that the application and accompanying affidavit  if they  in combination  address fully and comprehensively all the matters specified in s     might provide sufficient information to enable the Registrar to be satisfied about all matters referred to in s  B  This suggests that the quality and nature of the information necessary to satisfy the Registrar will be of the same general quality and nature as the information required to be included in the application and accompanying affidavit  Of course  if an applicant fails to fully and comprehensively furnish the information required by s   then there is a risk that the Registrar will not accept the claim although that risk is ameliorated by the power of the Registrar to consider information additional to that contained in the application  including documents  other than the application  provided by an applicant  see s  A a       What then is the nature and quality of the information required by s   In substance  s   requires that the accompanying affidavit must contain evidence that the applicant believes the claimed rights have not been extinguished  believes none of the claimed area is covered by an entry in the Register  believes all the statements made in the application are true and that the applicant is authorised to make the application  The application must contain the details specified in s   and may contain details of the matters referred to in s  c   There is an obvious link between the requirement that the evidence of the applicant include a statement that the applicant believes that all the statements in the application are true and the requirement that the application contain the details specified in s   together with the identification of the details in that subsection     Of central importance in this appeal are the details specified by s  e    namely details which constitute a general description of the factual basis on which it is asserted that the native title rights and interests claimed existed and  in particular  the matters referred to in ss  e   i   ii  and  iii   Those details are in aid of the description  with some particularity  required by s  d  of the asserted native title rights and interests  The fact that the detail specified by s  e  is described as  a general description of the factual basis  is an important indicator of the nature and quality of the information required by s    In other words  it is only necessary for an applicant to give a general description of the factual basis of the claim and to provide evidence in the affidavit that the applicant believes the statements in that general description are true  Of course the general description must be in sufficient detail to enable a genuine assessment of the application by the Registrar under s  A and related sections  and be something more than assertions at a high level of generality  But what the applicant is not required to do is to provide anything more than a general description of the factual basis on which the application is based  In particular  the applicant is not required to provide evidence of the type which  if furnished in subsequent proceedings  would be required to prove all matters needed to make out the claim  The applicant is not required to provide evidence that proves directly or by inference the facts necessary to establish the claim   Emphasis added    The Full Court observed  supra  at   that   We  think there are observations of the primary judge in his reasons which suggest that his Honour approached the material before the Registrar on the basis that it should be evaluated as if it was evidence furnished in support of the claim  If  in truth  this was the approach his Honour adopted  then it involved error   This observation though did not form the basis upon which the appeal in the Gudjala People     case was allowed  The appeal was allowed on the basis of an error perceived by the Full Court in the way that learned trial judge had evaluated and come to discount the report of an expert anthropologist  Mr Hagen which formed part of the application for determination of native title  That evidence had been criticised or in many respects rejected on the basis that it  provides opinions and conclusions rather than any alleged factual basis for such opinions and conclusions or for the claim    That was held to be in error for two reasons  It was inconsistent with the position under the Evidence Act    Cth  in which a  basis rule  requiring facts upon which an expert opinion or conclusion is based to be established before that opinion or conclusion is admissible does not prevail  Rather  under that Act  an absence of establishment of such facts may diminish the weight to afford that opinion or conclusion  Further  it ignored the position that expert anthropological evidence may not necessarily be opinion evidence at all but rather be direct evidence of the anthropologist s observations and thus admissible in the ordinary course  Even though Mr Hagen s report did not fall for consideration by reference to questions of admissibility that would arise on a trial of the application  the Full Court  supra  at   considered that his Honour s erroneous conception  affected his approach in assessing the matters required to be considered by s  B    Certainly  in evaluating for the purposes of s  F a  of the Native Title Act the prospect of a different outcome an amended application was considered by the Registrar  it is necessary to make that evaluation informed by what was said by the Full Court in the Gudjala People     case  particularly in the parts I have emphasised in the passage from the Full Court s judgement quoted above  Even though  by the time when a show cause proceeding under s  F  is conducted  the occasion for the review of an adverse registration decision will have passed  I am prepared to accept that  for the purposes of s  F b  an  other reason  might be found for not dismissing an application in circumstances where later judicial authority in another case disclosed that the Registrar s approach to whether the conditions in s  B had been satisfied had been overly rigorous   Even allowing for such matters  it seems that the Applicant acknowledges that in its present form the application is wanting in detail  especially in the provision of a factual basis for an assertion that the native title claim group have continued to hold the native title in accordance with acknowledged traditional laws  s  B c   It is not clear to me  having regard to what I have regarded as key passages in the Delegate s reasons and quoted above  that her conclusions in relation to s  B  were wholly attributable to the influence of decision of Dowsett J in the Gudjala People     case  In the absence of a more developed and particularised submission as to the ways in which  having regard to her reasons  his Honour s reasons for judgment in the Gudjala People     case impacted upon the Delegate s reasons and how the outcome may have differed in light of the observations of the Full Court further consideration of this subject is not  in my opinion  warranted   It was further submitted on behalf of the Applicant that the State was aware of the status of the application   It is relevant to note that the State has not moved under s  F  to strike out the application but neither is it necessary that it do so  The Court is empowered under this sub section to dismiss an application of its own motion  That may perhaps evidence a recognition by the Parliament that  even where the claim made in an application has proved incapable of furnishing  even at the registration stage  a factual basis for the assertions mentioned in s  B   a respondent body politic may be unable or unwilling to seek dismissal of that application  If so  that recognition is unarticulated in secondary materials citedMembers of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  As to the factual basis for the assertion in s  B c  of the Native Title Act   the Delegate stated  inter alia  The reasons for my decision here and at ss  B a  and  b  are closely linked  I am not satisfied that there is a sufficient factual basis to support the assertion that native title rights and interest of the claim group exist because I am not satisfied that there is a sufficient factual basis to support the assertion that the laws and customs acknowledged and observed by that group are  traditional  in the Yorta Yorta sense  I have formed this view due to the lack of information I have been given about the existence of a society at sovereignty and moreover  the removal of two of the three apical ancestors from the application area  I draw on the statements I considered under ss  B a  and  b  with respect to the removal of the two of the apical ancestors from the application area  namely  Emily Underwood and James White and their respective descendants  Attachment F goes further it talks of James White and his family being removed to the Palm Island settlement in   with the members of this family returning to live permanently on the claim area in the  s  It also said in Attachment F that  once it was possible  from the  s onwards  to move back to the Townsville  sic  many descendants of the Disapora community did so   The information speaks of James White  but also Ada Underwood s descendants living  a long way away for several generations   from page   of the report authored by Mr Heijm   I consider that these   to   years represent a significant break in the continuity of observance and acknowledgement of the law and customs of the group  In light of this information  it is not possible that I can be satisfied that there is a sufficient factual basis to support the assertion that the native title claim group has continued to hold its native title rights and interests by acknowledging and observing traditional laws and customs in a substantially uninterrupted way  And as reasoned above  I am not satisfied that the factual basis provided shows that the laws and customs are  traditional    The Delegate s reference to  Yorta Yorta  in the passage quoted is a reference to Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria   HCA         CLR     As to s  B  of the Native Title Act   the Delegate was not satisfied that there was a sufficient factual basis to support the assertion that the native title rights and interests claimed in the application could be established  prima facie    In respect of s  B  of the Native Title Act   the Delegate stated  In accordance with my reasoning at ss  B  and   I cannot be satisfied that at least one member of the native title claim group currently has or previously had a traditional physical connection with any part of the land or waters covered by the application  This is the case as I am not of the view that the requirement of  traditional  has been established in this application  I accept that Ms George currently has a physical connection with the application area but I am not able to establish that it is a  traditional  connection in the Yorta Yorta sense consideredNorthern Territory v Doepel   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The Delegate

the Commonwealth  It is s  F  which provides the  screening mechanism  consideredTillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australian Meat Industry Employees  Union     FLR   Within s  F a  the meaning to afford the word  likely  is elusive  The judgments delivered by Bowen CJ  with whom Evatt J agreed  and Deane J in Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australian Meat Industry Employees  Union     FLR   in relation to the meaning of that word as it appears in s  D of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  nicely illustrate why this is so  Sir Nigel Bowen observed  at     The word  likely  is one which has various shades of meaning  It may mean  probable  in the sense of  more probable than not     more than a fifty per cent chance   It may mean  material risk  as seen by a reasonable man  such as might happen   It may mean  some possibility    more than a remote or bare chance  Or  it may mean that the conduct engaged in is inherently of such a character that it would ordinarily cause the effect specified  In Australian Telecommunications Commission v Kreig Enterprises Pty  Ltd      FLR   Bray C J  had to consider the meaning of the word  likely  in s   B of the Post and Telegraph Act      Cth   The context  of course  was different  However  Bray C J  concluded it meant  more probable than not  in that context  His Honour expressed the view that that was the natural and ordinary meaning of  likely  though he referred also to the rules of construction applicable where the statute being interpreted is a penal statute or one which  as in the case of s   B  imposed an additional liability beyond the liability in tort  It was suggested by Joske J  in Trade Practices Commission v Total Australia Ltd      FLR   that  likely  in s      of the Trade Practices Act was equivalent to  calculated  and he referred to Thurley v Hayes   HCA         CLR     at p     However  in that case  calculated  was interpreted to mean  likely  in order to rid the word of its overtones of intention      The circumstances to which s   D may apply are so various that I hesitate to place a gloss on the section by preferring one meaning of  likely  rather than another for the determination of this particular case  It is unnecessary to do so  because I have formed the view that whichever meaning is adopted the evidence leads me to the conclusion that the likelihood of substantial loss or damage has been established  Mr Justice Deane observed  at     The word  likely  can  in some context  mean  probably  in the sense in which that word is commonly used by lawyers and laymen  that is to say  more likely than not or more than a fifty per cent chance  an odds on chance  per Lord Hodson in Koufos v  C  Czarnikow Ltd      AC   at p   and see  as to the meaning of the word  probable  Eggleston Evidence  Proof and Probability   p    et seq   It can also  in an appropriate context  refer to a real or not remote chance or possibility regardless of whether it is less or more than fifty per cent  When used with the latter meaning in a phrase which is descriptive of conduct  the word is equivalent to  prone   with a propensity  or  liable   When so used  it is sometimes equated with the concept of foreseeability in the law of negligence  see  for example  Overseas Tankship  U K   Ltd  v  Miller Steamship Co  Pty  Ltd   Wagon Mound No        AC   at pp       Callaghan v  Wm  C  Lynch Pty  Ltd      WN  NSW      at p      Thus  if I fire a rifle through drawn curtains into a quiet lane in a country village  it is not likely  in the sense of more likely than not or an odds on chance  that I will injure anyone  It would  however  be difficult to deny that there was a real chance or possibility  or likelihood in that sense  that an occasional passer by would be wounded by the bullet  Plainly  the act of firing a rifle through drawn curtains into a lane used by pedestrians would be an act which was  in the circumstances  prone or liable  likely in that sense  to cause injury to a passing pedestrian  In Australian Telecommunications Commission v  Krieg Enterprises Pty  Ltd      FLR   Bray C J   after an instructive consideration of relevant authorities  expressed the view that the ordinary and natural meaning of the word  likely  is synonymous with the ordinary and natural meaning of the word  probable  and both words mean that there is an odds on chance of the thing happening  His Honour added that statutes containing the words have usually been construed that way  particularly so where the statute is a penal statute or is imposing an additional liability in tort  This view  if accepted  would lead to the conclusion that  prima facie  the word  likely  in s   D   means probably in the sense of more likely than not  While dictionary definitions and examples of judicial and lay usage can be adduced to offer strong support for that view  I am unable to accept that likely is synonymous with  more likely than not  or that if there is a     per cent chance of an event occurring it would ordinarily be denied that it was likely  or  quite likely  that the event would occur  Nor does it appear to me that there is a presumption that  in a legislative provision proscribing conduct that is likely to cause loss or damage to another  the legislative intent was that conduct which had a     per cent chance of causing such damage was to be outside the proscription   Thus  depending upon the context in which it appears   likely  can mean  more probable than not  or it can mean  some possibility  more than a remote or bare chance   Tillmanns Butcheries and  in turn  Australian Telecommunications Commission v Kreig Enterprises Pty  Ltd   referred to in each of the substantive judgments delivered in Tillmanns Butcheries  demonstrate the importance of context in the determination of the meaning of the word  For example  that there was a reticence on the part of this Court in Tillmanns Butcheries to confine the meaning of the word to  more probable than not  in the context a provision directed in the public interest to the proscription of a form of behaviour in trade or commerce considered by Parliament to be undesirable is  with respect  readily comprehensible consideredWestern Australia v Strickland   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The occasion for affording the word  likely  the meaning  more probable than not  in a provision directed to the dismissal of a native title application without a hearing on the merits of that application is less compelling  It is true that the occasion for the exercise of the dismissal power in s  F  of the Native Title Act may arise after the Registrar s registration decision has either been administratively reviewed on the merits by the NNTT or reviewed by this Court  In the latter form of review the Court may make such decision in respect of issues of fact and law on the material then available as will do justice  Western Australia v Strickland   FCA         FCR    Full Court   Yet the focus of these review alternatives remains the Registrar s registration decision  not a determination of the merits of the native title claim made in the application   Regard pursuant to s  AB of the Acts Interpretation Act    Cth  to secondary materials concerning the Bill which became the Technical Amendments Act offers no assistance either in the preferable meaning to afford the word  likely  in s  F a  or  for that matter  in the ascertainment of the purpose of the power conferred on the Court by the sub section   The reference in the explanatory memorandum to the clause which became s  F  is nothing more than a paraphrase of the provision  The Ministerial Second Reading Speech  Commonwealth Parliamentary Debates  House of Representatives    March   p    in respect of the Bill which became the Technical Amendments Act is brief  the then Attorney remarking generally of the amendments proposed in that Bill   While these amendments are minor and technical in nature  they will substantially improve the workability of the Native Title Act    There is no reference to the proposed empowerment of the Court to dismiss an application as a sequel to a decision by the Register not to accept for registration the claim made in it and after exhaustion of review remedies in respect of that decision   Amendments to that Bill were proposed in the Senate following a report by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee of that House  Both in that committee s report and in Parliamentary debates one finds reference to the report of a review commissioned by the then Attorney General of native title claims resolution processes by two members of the Queensland Bar  Mr Hiley RFD  QC and Dr Levy RFD  Hiley and Levy  Native Title Claims Resolution Review  Commonwealth of Australia  released on   March    The report of that review was made public but it was not tabled in the Parliament  Further  the extent of its influence on the presence in the Native Title Act of what is now s  F  is not made clear either in an explanatory memorandum or the Second Reading Speech  In these circumstances  I do not consider that it would be appropriate to refer to that review report for statutory construction purposes   A study of secondary materials confirms what a perusal of the   Amendment Act and the Technical Amendments Act would in any event suggest  which is that the two Acts were the culmination of an endeavour to address inadequacies perceived by the Parliament in native title law and
