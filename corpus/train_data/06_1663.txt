Pfizer Products Inc v Karam   FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAustereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC    The inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before the Delegate    I certify that the preceding fifty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles

cases cth FCA  htmlappliedAustralian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before the Delegate    I certify that the preceding fifty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles

cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedBabaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before

Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before the Delegate    I certify that the preceding fifty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles    Associate Dated    December   Counsel

Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlThe grounds of opposition which were pressed before the delegate of the Registrar of Trade Marks were based upon ss       and   of the   Act  The delegate found that the opponent had not made out any of the grounds of opposition with the consequence that the mark would proceed to registration  This is an appeal pursuant to s   from that decision  The appeal is a hearing de novo   Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR    The Court stands in the shoes of the Registrar but decides the issue judicially  cf New England Biolabs Inc v F Hoffman La Roche AG   FCAFC         FCR    The inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before the Delegate    I certify that the preceding fifty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles    Associate Dated    December   Counsel for the Applicant  Mr RJ Webb SC     Solicitor for the Applicant  Baker   McKenzie     Counsel for the Respondent  Mrs C Champion     Solicitor for the Respondent  Matthews Folbigg Pty Ltd   Dates of Hearing      July       Date of Judgment    December         AustLII  Copyright Policy   Disclaimers   Privacy Policy   Feedback   URL  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedBP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC    The inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before the Delegate    I certify that the preceding fifty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles    Associate Dated    December   Counsel for the Applicant  Mr RJ Webb SC     Solicitor for the Applicant  Baker   McKenzie     Counsel for the Respondent  Mrs C Champion     Solicitor for the Respondent  Matthews Folbigg Pty Ltd   Dates of Hearing      July       Date of Judgment    December         AustLII  Copyright Policy   Disclaimers   Privacy Policy   Feedback   URL  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedCadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR  The inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should

 The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before the Delegate    I certify that the preceding fifty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles    Associate Dated    December   Counsel for the Applicant  Mr RJ Webb SC     Solicitor for the Applicant  Baker   McKenzie     Counsel for the Respondent  Mrs C Champion     Solicitor for the Respondent

cases cth FCA  htmlcitedCampomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before the Delegate    I certify that the preceding fifty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles

cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toCaterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR  The inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before the Delegate    I certify that the preceding fifty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles    Associate Dated    December   Counsel

Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC    http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlThe inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before the Delegate    I certify that the preceding fifty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles    Associate Dated    December   Counsel

Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlThe inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before the Delegate    I certify that the preceding fifty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles    Associate Dated    December   Counsel for the Applicant  Mr RJ Webb SC     Solicitor for the Applicant  Baker   McKenzie     Counsel for the Respondent  Mrs C Champion     Solicitor for the Respondent  Matthews Folbigg Pty Ltd   Dates of

Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before the Delegate    I certify that the preceding fifty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles    Associate Dated    December   Counsel

La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlThe inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before

Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC  The inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before the Delegate    I certify that the preceding fifty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment

htmlThe inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before the Delegate    I certify that the preceding fifty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles    Associate Dated    December   Counsel for the Applicant  Mr RJ Webb SC     Solicitor for the Applicant  Baker   McKenzie     Counsel for the Respondent  Mrs C Champion     Solicitor for the Respondent

cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedJohn v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before the Delegate    I certify that the preceding fifty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles    Associate Dated    December   Counsel for the Applicant  Mr RJ Webb SC     Solicitor for the Applicant  Baker   McKenzie     Counsel for the Respondent  Mrs C Champion     Solicitor for the Respondent  Matthews Folbigg Pty Ltd   Dates of

Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC    The inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products

Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before the Delegate    I certify that the preceding fifty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment

s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before the Delegate    I certify that the preceding fifty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles    Associate Dated    December   Counsel for the Applicant  Mr RJ Webb SC     Solicitor for the Applicant  Baker   McKenzie     Counsel for the Respondent  Mrs C Champion     Solicitor for the Respondent

cases cth FCA  htmlcitedMcCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC    http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlThe inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before the Delegate    I certify that the preceding fifty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles    Associate Dated    December   Counsel for the Applicant  Mr RJ Webb SC     Solicitor for the Applicant  Baker   McKenzie     Counsel for the Respondent  Mrs C Champion     Solicitor for the Respondent  Matthews Folbigg Pty Ltd   Dates of

htmldistinguishedMcIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR  The inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before the Delegate    I certify that the preceding fifty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles    Associate Dated    December   Counsel for the Applicant  Mr RJ Webb SC     Solicitor for the Applicant  Baker   McKenzie     Counsel for the Respondent  Mrs C Champion     Solicitor for the Respondent  Matthews Folbigg Pty Ltd   Dates of Hearing      July       Date of Judgment    December         AustLII  Copyright Policy   Disclaimers   Privacy Policy   Feedback   URL  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedMID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR  The inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before the Delegate    I certify that the preceding fifty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment

inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the

        FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlThe provisions of the   Act were examined by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   particularly in the judgment of French J with whom Tamberlin J agreed  The case concerned the acceptance stage of the proceedings rather than an opposition  French J  after referring to the terms of s   said  at        The mandatory language of s  gives effect to the intention  expressed in the Second Reading Speech  that there is to be a presumption of registrability when the application is examined by the Registrar of Trade Marks  This is a shift from the position under the previous law whereby the onus was on the applicant to establish registrability Jafferjee v Scarlett   HCA         CLR   at   and    In respect of the   Act see Advanced Hair Studio of America Pty Ltd v Registrar of Trade Marks     IPR   at    King J   This shift reflects recommendation  A of the Working Party s   Report that  t he legislation should be expressed in terms which make it clear that there is to be a presumption of registrability when examining an application for registration   It brings the Australian law into line with the approach taken internationally as expressed in the European Communities  Directive on Trade Mark Laws  December   the TRIPS agreement and developments in the United Kingdom and New Zealand      Interestingly enough  when discussing the nature of the appeal in such a case  French J said  at      The mandatory language of s   and the legislative policy which informs it also suggest that the acceptance stage is not the time for the kind of detailed adversarial examination of the application that might emerge from a contested opposition  This will have an impact upon the way in which the Registrar approaches the question whether a mark proposed for registration is deceptively similar to others  The condition of refusal of an application is that the Registrar is satisfied that there are grounds for rejection  If not so satisfied the Registrar must accept the application  Unless the Registrar thinks that the proposed trade mark is likely to deceive or to cause confusion then all other things being equal  the application must be accepted  Subject to such weight as it gives the Registrar s decision  the Court is placed in the same position in its approach to evaluation of deceptive similarity  This issue of the interaction between the judgment about deceptive similarity and the stage in the process at which this judgment is made will be considered further below      emphasis added   And later  at      Section   imposes upon the Registrar and the Court  on appeal from the Registrar  an obligation to accept the application unless satisfied either that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or that there are grounds for rejecting it  The decision to reject an application regularly made must now be based upon positive satisfaction that a ground for rejecting it is made out      Branson J s judgment was to the same effect at      There is no suggestion in the judgments that there is any special high onus to be satisfied  even at the acceptance stage  Counsel for Pfizer submits that there is no proper basis for transposing the presumption of registrability that applies to s   and the appeal to the Court at the acceptance stage with a s   opposition and appeal to the Court pursuant to s    cf Mark Davison  Kate Johnston and Patricia Kennedy  Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks and Passing Off     rd edn  Lawbook Co   Sydney    paragraph      However  it is now well entrenched from the authorities to which reference will be made that the presumption of registrability is also to be applied in the setting of opposition to registration and  in particular  to the application of s   in a s   appeal  Whatever doubts there may be as to the correctness of that approach  the words of s   can accommodate it and I will apply it  The inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before the Delegate    I certify that the preceding fifty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment

inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before the Delegate    I certify that the preceding fifty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles

cases cth FCA  htmlappliedThe Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before the Delegate    I certify that the preceding fifty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles    Associate Dated    December   Counsel for the Applicant  Mr RJ Webb SC     Solicitor for the Applicant  Baker   McKenzie     Counsel for the Respondent  Mrs C Champion     Solicitor for the Respondent

cases cth FCA  htmlcitedTGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlThe inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before the Delegate    I certify that the preceding fifty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles    Associate Dated    December   Counsel for the Applicant  Mr RJ Webb SC     Solicitor for the Applicant  Baker   McKenzie     Counsel for the Respondent  Mrs C Champion     Solicitor for the Respondent  Matthews Folbigg Pty Ltd   Dates of

BP plc   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlThe inspiration for Karam s position is to be found in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC       AIPC      That was an application to the Full Court pursuant to s   for leave to appeal against a single judge decision on an appeal from the Registrar of Trade Marks  Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was upheld  In the course of discussing the considerations relevant to leave to appeal  the Court said as follows  at          No submissions were addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  The presence of s   suggests that a parallel should be drawn with the scheme of appeals in opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   On that basis  on appeal under s     the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered  Only if so satisfied should the Court decide to uphold an opposition      The fact that leave to appeal from the decision of a single judge is required indicates the quasi summary nature of an opposition proceeding   An unsuccessful opponent would always have the opportunity to bring an expungement proceeding if the opposition proceeding fails  In an expungement proceeding  the validity of a trade mark can be fully explored  That is a reason for concluding that there should not be a full exploration of the prospective validity of a trade mark on an appeal in an opposition proceeding      Thus  it would be inappropriate for there to be a full exploration of the validity of the trade mark in two separate proceedings in the Court  first in an appeal in an opposition proceeding and then  subsequently  if the opposition proceeding failed  in an expungement proceeding  Those considerations emphasise the need for the Full Court  before refusing leave to appeal pursuant to s   of the Act  to be satisfied that a decision by a single judge upholding an opposition is undoubtedly correct      emphasis added   In the course of the substantive decision the Court said  at      The legislative scheme relating to opposition proceedings set out above indicates that an opponent has the onus of establishing the ground of opposition relied on  In the present context  that means that Winton and the Company must establish that Ms Lomas was not the owner of the Trade Mark as at the Priority date  at least on the balance of probabilities  On one view  they may be required to establish that she was clearly not the owner see para   above      In the event  however  the Court decided the substantive issue on the balance of probabilities  although adding that it was not persuaded on the higher basis    Emmett J was one of the members of the Court  It is to be noted that the point had not been argued  and that the obiter dicta was tentative        F Hoffman La Roche AG v New England Biolabs Inc   FCA         FCR   involved two appeals arising out of opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth   Emmett J considered the nature of such appeals  His consideration of the legislation led him to say  at           pre grant opposition is intended to provide a relatively inexpensive mechanism for resolving third party disputes as to validity  The purpose of pre grant opposition proceedings is to provide a swift and economical means of settling disputes that would otherwise need to be dealt with by the courts in more expensive and time consuming post grant litigation  that is  to decrease the occasion for costly revocation proceedings by ensuring that bad patents do not proceed to grant  see Genetics Institute Inc v Kirin Amgen Inc   FCA         FCR   at         FCA       ALR   at        It is a good thing to have some process by which patents that are obviously invalid will not be allowed to clutter the register  see McGlashan v Rabett   HCA         CLR   at        emphasis added   He then considered the authorities and concluded  at          it should appear clear to the Court that no patent granted in respect of the specification would be valid  I consider that  before the Court would uphold an opposition to the grant of a patent  the Court should be clearly satisfied that the patent   if granted  would not be valid   That  however  is not to say that an opponent should not be permitted appropriate opportunity to lead evidence in chief as to the facts that are designed to demonstrate  with the requisite degree of clarity  that a patent  if granted  would not be valid      emphasis added   Emmett J acknowledged that the previous authorities were not decisive     Bennett J then considered the issue in relation to trade marks in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    Again  the matter had not been raised by the parties but the Judge sought and received submissions  Bennett J applied the reasoning of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG in relation to opposition proceedings under the Patents Act    Cth  to trade marks opposition proceedings  Bennett J also relied upon the report of the Working Party to Review the Trade Marks Legislation  July   paragraph        Bennett J said that adopting the test from F Hoffman La Roche AG was consistent with the approach that was taken by the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     where it referred to the  presumption of registrability  under the   Act  As I have pointed out  the judgments in Woolworths provide no support for a special high onus in opposition proceedings or for opposition proceedings being summary in nature  In the substantive decision by Bennett J  the various grounds of opposition were rejected without any reference to a special onus  The reference to onus in par   seems to refer to the ordinary onus of establishing a ground  Neither of the two authorities cited   Woolworths and Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd     CLR    refer to any special onus  In the last sentence of par   Bennett J finds a lack of satisfaction on the ordinary basis and on the  clearly not be registered  basis  Not long afterwards  I was confronted with the same issue in Clinique Laboratories Inc v Luxury Skin Care Brands Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC      I indicated that I found it difficult to see how s   could be read in the manner contended for by Karam in this case and briefly explained that view  I did not need to form a final view about that for the purposes of that case as I found that the grounds of opposition had not been established on either basis  Kenny J referred to the issue in McCorquodale v Masterson   FCA         IPR     AIPC      After citing Torpedoes and Lomas   but not Clinique  Kenny J said  at        The opposition is to be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should not be registered because it is satisfied that a ground of opposition is made out      That statement of principle is consistent with the position of Pfizer in this case  In the substantive portion of the judgment Kenny J did not refer to the application of any special high onus     Shortly after that  Finkelstein J referred to the issue in BP plc v Woolworths Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC      His Honour expressed a particular view about distinctiveness and went on  at        My approach conforms to that suggested in Blount Inc v Registrar of Trade Marks   FCA         FCR     but may be inconsistent with the views expressed in Lomas v Winton Shire Council   FCAFC   at para           and Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR           The latter two cases were dealing with a slightly different point and  in any event  may have impermissibly borrowed from patent law         In Austereo Pty Ltd v DMG Radio  Australia  Pty Ltd     ALR       IPR     AIPC     Finn J followed Torpedoes  as a matter of comity   There was no reference to Clinique  In Health World Ltd v Shin Sun Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR     AIPC     Cooper J noted Clinique but expressed agreement with Bennett J s analysis and reasoning in Torpedoes  however  as he was satisfied that the applicant did not make out its grounds of objection on the balance of probabilities  it was not necessary to apply the higher standard  Lander J was confronted by these authorities in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon     ALR       IPR     AIPC      Having referred to them  his Honour proceeded to examine the submission that the reasoning in Lomas was inconsistent with the report of the Working Party and certain other arguments and concluded as follows  at          I must say I share the same doubts that were expressed by Finkelstein J and Gyles J in their consideration of this point  However  there is authority of the Full Court directly on point      I do not think that the decision in Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths is ambiguous  French J said that there is a presumption of registrability  that Jafferjee no longer is relevant  that the Court must apply the same legal criteria as the Registrar  that because of the obligation imposed by s   the application must be accepted unless the Court is satisfied that the application has not been made in accordance with the Act or there are grounds for rejecting it  and that the decision to reject must be made upon positive satisfaction that the ground has been made out      Both Registrar of Trademarks v Woolworths and Lomas stand for the proposition that the Court as well as the Registrar should approach the question of registration with the presumption of registrability in mind and when on appeal to this Court the Court should consider whether the trade mark should clearly not be registered      I think I am bound to follow Woolworths and Lomas  and I should as a matter of comity follow Torpedoes because it has been followed by other judges of this Court      Therefore  I would proceed on the basis that the onus lies on the respondent to establish the grounds of opposition it relies upon and that I should not uphold those grounds unless I am satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered         With all respect  neither Woolworths nor Lomas decided the point at issue  It was not mentioned in Woolworths and was plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument in Lomas   Accepting that there is a presumption of registrability says nothing as to the standard of proof and does not carry with it an obligation to  clearly  establish a ground of opposition  In Woolworths v BP plc   FCAFC         FCR    an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Finklelstein J referred to earlier  Sundberg and Bennett JJ said  at          In Lomas the Full Court suggested that a parallel could be drawn between the Act and the Patents Act     Cth  and said that on that basis an opposition should only be upheld if the Court were satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered      In Lomas the Full Court acknowledged at   that no submissions had been addressed to the Court concerning the standard to be applied by a single judge in considering an appeal under s   of the Act  In Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   Bennett J followed Lomas   In that case  neither party had raised the test at the hearing but were given the opportunity to file written submissions  Other judges have followed Torpedoes   Some judges of the Court have expressed reservations about the Lomas test as applied in an appeal from an opposition      In Kowa Co Ltd v NV Organon   FCA   Lander J at     considered in some detail the competing arguments as to the correctness of this test as well as the course that has been taken and the observations made by different judges of the Court  Despite his Honour s own reservations  he considered that he was bound to follow those decisions that applied the test expounded in Lomas     The authors of Shanahan s Australian Law of Trade Marks   Passing Off  rd ed    also question the drawing of a parallel between opposition proceedings under the Act and under the Patents Act   They note that the Full Court in Renaud expressed the view that so far as possible there should be uniformity in the court s approach for leave to appeal in the area of intellectual property as a whole but the authors expressed some doubt whether an applicant for a trade mark is in the same position as an applicant for a patent      It is appropriate that the question be considered by a Full Court with the benefit of submissions from the parties  if the basis for leave being granted is otherwise established      In the events which happened  the question was not determined in the substantive appeal   Woolworths Ltd v BP plc   FCAFC        I observe that Branson J  one of the judges on the Full Court in Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd   applied what I would describe as the ordinary onus in NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S  Pte Ltd     IPR     AIPC       FCA     although apparently in the absence of argument  see  particularly  par    The fundamental difficulty with Karam s argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s    Whether a ground of opposition has been  established  is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation  In my opinion  there is no basis upon which the section can be read as  the extent  if any  to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established  particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof  It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all  The precise finding in that case was that the opposition  should be upheld only if the Court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered   at    With all respect  that test is not to be found in the statute  I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the   Act that would point to reading s   other than according to its ordinary meaning  In my opinion  it is not permissible to put a gloss on the clear words of the section by reference to extrinsic material  In any event  the extrinsic material does not support Karam s argument  The discussion of the Working Party Report by Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd  at     adequately discloses the difficulty  Furthermore  it can be taken that implementation of the recommendation of the Working Party about the bringing of opposition proceedings in trade marks into agreement with those applicable to patents  where appropriate  was effected  so far as was regarded as appropriate  by the   Act and Regulations made under the   Act  In my opinion  borrowing further from the field of patents in this respect is impermissible  to adopt the word used by Finkelstein J  Trade marks and patents are different species of intellectual property and have a different history  A general desire for uniformity cannot control construction of the statute governing each  It is also to be noted that the approach of Emmett J in F Hoffman La Roche AG did not represent established patent practice at the time of the Working Party Report  It was novel when handed down in   long after the   Act had been enacted  and is still controversial  It is also anomalous that  when it comes to amendment of the Register by order of the Court pursuant to Div   of Pt   of the   Act on grounds similar to those involved here  there is no hint of the application of any special onus  although in such a situation the mark has actually been registered  An opponent could bring proceedings immediately after grant on that basis  Further  as I said in Clinique  at        It appears to be a consequence of this reasoning that a party can oppose the grant of a patent or a trade mark  including appeal to the Court  causing considerable expense and delay and  even if unsuccessful  then bring expungement or revocation proceedings based upon precisely the same ground as relied upon in the opposition proceedings  It is difficult to see how any estoppel or other principle could prevent this occurring if opposition is a summary proceeding decided by reference to a special high onus  cf Miller v University of New South Wales     ALR      The opportunity for oppression of an applicant at the hands of a well resourced commercial opponent is obvious         There is another real problem with the proposition that the purpose of an opposition  whether before the Registrar or on appeal  is to weed out obviously bad trade marks in a summary fashion  Before there can be an appeal pursuant to s   the mark has been accepted and then has survived a contested opposition  A delegate has delivered reasons for rejecting the grounds of opposition  The Court is to give respect to the opinion of the delegate   Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd per French J at    Where  as in this case  the grounds of opposition are essentially matters of degree calling for judgment  it is difficult to see much scope for arguing successfully that the trade mark is clearly bad where it has survived such scrutiny  I am faced with the clear words of the statute  on one hand  and the opinions of various judges  on the other  There is no binding Full Court authority  I cannot find any instance where a single judge has actually applied the higher standard  In my opinion  in this case  comity does not demand that I depart from my view as to the meaning of the statute   The fundamental responsibility of a court when it interprets a statute is to give effect to the legislative intention as it is expressed in the statute  per Mason J in Babaniaris v Lutony Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   cited with approval by Mason CJ  Wilson  Dawson  Toohey and Gaudron JJ in John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   at    I will  therefore  approach the matter on the basis that the opponent has to establish a ground of opposition  although not clearly establish such a ground  whether in a summary fashion or otherwise    GROUNDS OF OPPOSITION     The grounds of opposition which are pressed on this appeal are those provided by ss     and    There is an obvious overlap between the three and it is useful to briefly note the relationship between them  What is the difference between s   and s   In the present case  the marks are not substantially identical  therefore  the issue is deceptive similarity  Section   depends upon the opponent s mark having acquired a reputation in Australia by virtue of which the use of the trade mark applied for would be likely to deceive or cause confusion because of the deceptive similarity between them  Section   refers to deceptive similarity between the applicant s mark and a mark registered by another person in respect of similar goods  In other words  the comparison is between mark and mark  not between mark and reputation  Where does s   fit it in  The focus of this section is a connotation or secondary meaning of the mark applied for which would make the use of the trade mark in respect of particular goods likely to deceive or cause confusion  There is a plethora of authority concerning s   and s    There is little authority as to s      EVIDENCE     Pfizer relied upon the evidence of Arthur Silverstein  an in house lawyer  to provide evidence of use and reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark and the product with which it is associated internationally and the evidence of Sally Glover  an in house lawyer  regarding the reputation of the VIAGRA trade mark in Australia  Silverstein dealt with the history  advertising and promotion of the product  advertising expenditure  sales of the product  trade mark registrations and  in relation to the reputation of VIAGRA  attached a representative sample of articles mentioning the product which have appeared in various United States publications with international circulations from newspapers  magazines and medical publications  Glover dealt with the history of VIAGRA  advertising of the product in Australia  the sales of the product bearing the trade mark in Australia  Australian trade mark protection and the reputation of VIAGRA  A good deal of material was produced in relation to reputation including market research  radio transcripts  media reports covering print and electronic media and the internet  Evidence also establishes that Pfizer is the only owner of a trade mark registration class   for a mark containing the   AGRA  suffix  The product in relation to which Pfizer uses the trade mark was the first oral treatment for erectile dysfunction  both in Australia and internationally   VIAGRA  is an invented word  The product was launched in Australia in September    The delegate  having considered that material  was satisfied that the VIAGRA marks were very well known in Australia and enjoyed a considerable reputation  both literally and for the purposes of the   Act  I can only agree  Karam does not dispute that conclusion as such  However  it is submitted that the reputation relates to a particular medical treatment for a particular medical condition available only on prescription from pharmacies  It is submitted for Pfizer that the reputation of VIAGRA is not limited to that strict core but has gained a wider reputation as being associated with sexual health and performance generally  including enhancement of sexual performance on the part of both males and females and the reputation is not limited to a prescription by medical practitioners available only in pharmacies  Counsel for Pfizer has pointed to examples in the material produced by Glover which would support such a wider reputation  The evidence warrants a conclusion that the trade mark  VIAGRA  is associated with a substance taken orally for enhancement of penile erection for the improvement of sexual performance as well as curing of penile dysfunction  I would not conclude that it would be generally understood that the product VIAGRA is only available on prescription from pharmacies and I would not limit the reputation of the mark in that way  Pfizer also relied upon an affidavit of Sarah Jane Armstrong  who gave evidence of purchasing the following listed drugs from various chemists around Sydney PANAMAX  PANADOL  DISPRIN  ASPALGIN  NUROFEN  PANAFEN  CODOX  CODIS and CODALGIN  Karam sought to rely upon the evidence of Ron Klein  a market research consultant  He was asked to give an opinion as to the following questions         In light of the documents and material provided to you and or identified by you please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product come from the same source       Section   of the Trade Marks Act          The determination to be made under section   is between the marks as registered or applied for  assuming a notional use of both  that is  a normal and fair use for all goods or services covered by the registration application being considered      The comparison is therefore to be made as between the HERBAGRA Marks and the marks the subject of the Pfizer registrations identified in the attached annexure  A   Please provide your expert opinion on the following      As at   December   was there a real likelihood of the use of any of the HERBAGRA Marks in respect of the HERBAGRA Products suggesting to consumers in Australia       a  an association with Pfizer  or          b  that the HERBAGRA products and the VIAGRA product bearing one or other of the Viagra Marks come from the same source            The opinions sought to be tendered were based firstly upon a process of reasoning by the witness and  secondly  upon market research in which he had been involved in relation to other products  That research was not proved beyond a bare statement of result  I rejected the evidence as I said I would follow the recent decision of Heerey J in Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Ltd     ALR    I said I would give reasons in this judgment  On reflection  it is sufficient as to the matter of principle involved  to say that I am unable to distinguish the issue here from that dealt with by Heerey J  As I was not  and am not  of the view that his decision was clearly wrong  it is appropriate that I follow it as a matter of comity in order that there be consistency of approach to this issue  In the present case  there is the further difficulty that the market research relied upon is not properly proven and  even if it were  it is not easy to see how the results can be transposed from one example to another  Karam initially sought to rely upon evidence from a solicitor giving an account  partially based on hearsay  of the effect of the Therapeutic Goods Act    Cth  and the administration of the system provided by it  That attempt was not persisted in  I am prepared to take notice of the fact that a complementary medicine  once listed  can be sold over the counter through various distribution channels not limited to pharmacies and advertised without any particular restrictions as to distribution  The parties also referred to various dictionary definitions    SECTION       In my opinion  a substantial number of members of the public would identify herbal medicines used to aid health  vitality and sexuality marketed under the name  HERBAGRA  to be a herbal version of VIAGRA  whether or not from the same source  or connected with VIAGRA because of the pervasive reputation of VIAGRA  In my opinion  there is sufficient similarity between the marks and between the goods with which each would be associated to lead to that result  It is submitted for Karam that marks must be compared as a whole without meticulous comparison and that it is the visual impact which is important  having in mind the products and the cause of trade  The words do not look alike  Because VIAGRA is so well known it would be readily distinguished from HERBAGRA  Reference was made to CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd     IPR     AIPC       ATPR       FCA   at     Cooper Engineering Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited   HCA         CLR   at   Gardenia Overseas Pte Ltd v The Garden Co Ltd  No       IPR   at     AIPC     Arista Ltd v Rysta Ltd     All ER       RPC   at    It was put by counsel for Karam that the market for both products is primarily that of men seeking remedy for erectile difficulties  although there may be a sub market comprised of men who do not suffer from erectile difficulties but nevertheless seek a means to improve their sexual performance  The users of both products are likely to be men of all ages and from all walks of life  A substantial proportion of these men are likely to have psychological and or physical problems that cause the erectile difficulties  Many are likely to be in their middle age or beyond that age range  It is submitted that where the commonality of characteristics diverges is that the VIAGRA product is a prescription drug and  therefore  will be sought out by men who are seeking a medical solution to their problem  The HERBAGRA product will be available over the counter in shops selling herbal remedies  such as health foods stores  chemists and supermarkets  It is likely to be purchased by men who are interested in alternative remedies and are seeking a  natural  cure for their erectile problem or a non pharmaceutical enhancement of their sexual performance  Overall it was submitted on behalf of Karam that  when the nature of the relevant consumer was considered  as well as their likely knowledge and familiarity with VIAGRA and the significant visual differences between the two marks  there would be no reasonable likelihood of a substantial number of members of the relevant class of consumers being confused in the relevant sense  It was submitted that to refuse the application as a result of the use of the suffix   AGRA  would be to give a practical monopoly to the applicant of all words conveying the same idea by the use of that suffix  Conveying the same idea is not sufficient to create a deceptive resemblance   Cooper Engineering at      In my opinion  these submissions under estimate the impact of the aural similarity between the words by virtue of the suffix   AGRA   It forms a clear link between the marks which is not explained in any way as  AGRA  has no relevant meaning  To see invented words such as this is to invite attention to the sound as well as the sight  even if the sound is  as it were  heard silently  In any event  the sound is used in discussion about the product for sale  ordering the product for sale  and so on    Berlei Hestia Industries Limited v The Bali Company Inc   HCA         CLR   at     I do not agree that the fame of VIAGRA would help to distinguish the marks  It would rather cause HERBAGRA to strike a chord with the consumer as to a link with VIAGRA  The deception or confusion need not persist until the point of purchase   Hack  Re Application to Register a Trade Mark     RPC   at     Southern Cross Refrigerating Co per Kitto J at       Campomar Sociedad Limitada and Another v Nike International Limited and Another   HCA         CLR   at      In my view  many potential purchasers would not know that VIAGRA is only available on prescription  Even if they did  there would be no reason for the ordinary consumer to reject the idea that there might be a complementary or herbal version of the prescription drug  The complaint about granting a monopoly of the word  AGRA  is of little substance  It is an invented word with no meaning in this context  To suggest that it conjures up the name of an Indian city or the famous waterfalls at Niagara  or that it has some connotation in agri business is irrelevant  It is not descriptive in any relevant sense  A submission for Karam which is closer to the reality of the present circumstances is that some people would see HERBAGRA as a cheeky take off of VIAGRA  That was a  perhaps the  reason for the decision of the Delegate on this point  The authority relied upon for this proposition is the decision of Lehane J in McIlhenny Co v Blue Yonder Holdings Pty Ltd formerly t as Tabasco Design     ALR       IPR    That was a s   and passing off case concerning the use of the well known word  Tabasco   associated with a pepper sauce  in connection with a business designing and constructing exhibition stands  His Honour said  at     ALR        It is one thing to suppose a connection where the brand  Dunhill  associated with an  upmarket  cigarette  starts to appear on an expanding range of other  and different   upmarket  goods  and even then  the expert evidence suggested  one might have wondered rather than jumped to the conclusion that there was an association  when one first saw that occurring  it is another  as a person with marketing responsibilities seeking the services of an exhibition designer  to conclude that a designer whose services are promoted under the name  Tabasco  has a commercial association with the well known sauce of that name  The far more likely conclusion is  I think  that  without any association or permission the designer has  as the fact is  perhaps cheekily used a name which  by reference to its only other known use  conjures up  hot  associations      Two points should be made  First  the question arising in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to s   or passing off is different from that arising under s    Secondly  the application of a well known trade mark to quite dissimilar goods is a very different question to that which arises here  It may be that some of the more sophisticated members of the public with marketing experience would understand that it is either likely or possible that a local entrepreneur was endeavouring to appropriate for itself and trade off part of VIAGRA s reputation  Lehane J referred to a number of those authorities in McIlhenny at     ALR         IPR      In my opinion  such persons would not be representative of the public at large      Applying the principles laid down in the High Court cases  such as Australian Woollen Mills Limited v F S Walton and Company Limited   HCA         CLR   Cooper Engineering  The Shell Company of Australia Limited v Esso Standard Oil  Australia  Limited   HCA         CLR   and Southern Cross Refrigerating Company that remain applicable under the   Act provided that onus is borne in mind  cf Coca Cola Company v All Fect Distributors Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     I am satisfied that the trade mark HERBAGRA in respect of the particular goods in question would be deceptively similar to the trade mark VIAGRA  which had acquired a reputation in Australia prior to the application for HERBAGRA  and that because of the reputation of VIAGRA the use of HERBAGRA would be likely to deceive or cause confusion  For the sake of completeness I should add that  although I am clear in my own mind as to the proper result  in view of the reasoned decision of the Delegate to the contrary and the earnest submissions on behalf of Karam  I could not find that the elements of s   were established clearly or beyond doubt if such a standard is required    SECTION       I am satisfied that the VIAGRA mark is registered in respect of similar goods to the goods in respect of which the HERBAGRA registration is sought  certainly in relation to registration No    If the reputation of the VIAGRA mark is to be taken into account for the purposes of s   then it would follow for the reasons given in relation to s   that HERBAGRA is deceptively similar to VIAGRA because it so nearly resembles that other that it is likely to deceive or cause confusion  s    It was sought on behalf of Karam to use reputation to assist in distinguishing the marks but  in my view  the reputation of VIAGRA increases the chance of confusion and deception  I am by no means satisfied that it is appropriate to take reputation into account for the purposes of the comparison relevant for s    The orthodox view is that what is compared is the lawful use in the future of each mark across the goods for which it is registered rather than being tied to what has happened in the past   Berlei Hestia per Mason J at   MID Sydney Pty Ltd v Australian Tourism Co Ltd     FCR   at      Section   brings in reputation  I am not persuaded that what was said by French J in Woolworths at   is sufficient to alter the test for s    There is support for the use of reputation in connection with infringement   CA Henschke   Co v Rosemount Estates Pty Ltd at   Caterpillar Loader Hire  Holdings  Pty Ltd v Caterpillar Tractor Co     ALR       IPR       FLR   per Lockhart J at   Franki J at   and Neaves J at    It is not clear that  if correct  this is to be imported into s    cf NEC Corporation v Punch Video  S     If the comparison is to be made without taking into account the existing reputation of VIAGRA  the similarity between the marks consists in a common suffix with no relevant meaning or connotation  Some would wonder whether the goods had the same source  but others would wonder whether the goods were of the same characteristics or had a common active ingredient  The evidence shows that it is not uncommon to have such goods sold in chemist shops with common prefixes or suffixes  If reputation were not taken into account  I would not be satisfied that Pfizer s mark would be deceptively similar to VIAGRA  I would certainly not be clearly satisfied that that was so    SECTION       Section   does not have a long pedigree  It was enacted pursuant to Australia s obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights  TRIPS   TRIPS and the   Working Party Report led to a   Bill containing the following cl        An application for the registration of a trade mark in respect of particular goods or services must be rejected if the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods or services would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding           a  the nature  quality  origin  intended purpose  or some other characteristic  of the goods or services  or      b  any connection or relationship that they may have with any particular person        That Bill was enacted but never came into force  In the   Bill  and Act  cl   of the   Bill was replaced by what is now s   of the   Act  The Explanatory Memorandum stated that cl   provides     That an application for registration must be rejected if the trade mark     because of some signification inherent to it  would be likely to deceive or cause confusion regarding a characteristic of the goods or services       Emphasis added   It seems that the final form of s   is a wider version of the earlier clause with a similar purpose      Connotation  is a secondary meaning implied by the mark  The likelihood of deception or confusion must flow from the secondary meaning inherent in the mark itself  It is apparent that the underlying purpose of s   is a similar purpose to that lying behind ss       and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   It is to prevent the public being deceived or confused as to the nature of the goods offered by reason of a secondary meaning connoted by the mark in question  rather than  for example  deception by reason of similarity with other marks   TGI Friday s Australia Pty Ltd v TGI Friday s Inc   FCA         FCR   at     McCorquodale v Masterson at      Section   might well prevent the registration of HERBAGRA for classes of goods with no connection with herbal ingredients  The argument for Pfizer is that the use of the suffix   AGRA  will cause the requisite confusion as to whether       a  the HERBAGRA product is out of the same stable as VIAGRA     b  the active ingredient in the HERBAGRA product is that in VIAGRA or is from the same family of ingredients     c  the HERBAGRA product is equivalent to VIAGRA in terms of its effects or achieves similar or related effects      In my opinion  there is no relevant secondary meaning connoted by the mark HERBAGRA  An implication of sponsorship or association might qualify as such a secondary meaning or connotation  but I am not persuaded that the mark itself has that secondary meaning here    CONCLUSION     The appeal should be allowed  the decision of the Delegate reversed and the orders of the Delegate set aside  The application to register the trade mark should be refused  Karam should pay Pfizer s costs of this appeal and of the opposition proceedings before the Delegate    I certify that the preceding fifty six   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment
