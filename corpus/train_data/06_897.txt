 Brennan and Deane JJ  in a joint judgment  sought to clarify what would be considered a  separate and disparate  matter  At     their Honours said       Perhaps it is not possible to devise so precise a formula that its application to the facts of any controversy would determine accurately what claims are disparate and what claims are not  Whatever formula be adopted as a guide   and the formula of  common transactions and facts  is a sound guide for the purpose   it must result in leaving outside the ambit of a matter a  completely disparate claim constituting in substance a separate proceeding  a non federal matter which is  completely separate and distinct from the matter which attracted federal jurisdiction  or  some distinct and unrelated non federal claim   Citations omitted   Their Honours continued at      The scope of a controversy which constitutes a matter is not ascertained merely by reference to the proceedings which a party may institute  but may be illuminated by the conduct of those proceedings and especially by the pleadings in which the issues in controversy are defined and the claims for relief are set out  But in the end  it is a matter of impression and of practical judgment whether a non federal claim and a federal claim joined in a proceeding are within the scope of one controversy and thus within the ambit of a matter      In short  this Court will have jurisdiction to hear and determine the cross claim in so far as it concerns the claimed sixth publication defamation  even though the claim raises no federal claim  if it shares a  common substratum of facts  with the principal proceeding  or if the claims are related in the sense that the determination of one is essential for the determination of the other referred toStack v Coast

Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Edensor Nominees Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     discussedHunt Australia Pty Ltd v Davidson s Arnhemland Safaris     ALR   The respondents relied on Hunt Australia Pty Ltd v Davidson s Arnhemland Safaris     ALR     Hunt   in support of the proposition that this proposed claim fell within the associated jurisdiction  In Hunt   a Full Court held that  on the facts of that case  a defamation claim was not completely separate and distinct from a claim under s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and therefore the court had jurisdiction to decide it  The circumstances of Hunt   though different  are not completely dissimilar to the present case  The parties in Hunt were competitors and the dominant purpose of the defamatory publication was  so the court at first instance found  to injure the other party  The Court held that there was a common substratum of facts even though the publication that gave rise to the misleading and deceptive conduct claim was separate from the publication that gave rise to the defamation claim  see Hunt at       I accept that the alleged sixth publication forms part of the one controversy and  for the reasons I am about to give  can be said to arise out of the same substratum of facts  The respondents  case is that the applicants have waged a campaign of defamatory conduct against them as part of the applicants  attempt to seize market share from the respondents  The cause of action with respect to the sixth publication is related to the other defamation claims pleaded by them  Similar factual and legal issues arise in respect of all the respondents  defamation claims  The applicants conceded that at least some of the respondents  defamation claims arise out of the same circumstances as the federal matters pleaded by them  In any case  as already noted  the applicants no longer contest the court s jurisdiction over the first to fifth defamation claims  I can discern no relevant distinction between the claim with respect to the sixth publication and the other claims  It is to be borne in mind that there is an issue as to whether the applicants were motivated by express malice in making the first publication  and there is a common temporal connection with respect to all the defamation claims and the remaining issues in the proceeding   Accordingly  I would grant leave to the respondents to amend their pleading in the manner they have sought referred toReading Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Mutual Provident Society   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases
