SZJFI v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedMinister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v NAMW   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Scarlett FM correctly found that the Tribunal did not have any obligation to notify the applicant of any information under s  A   The only information used by the Tribunal in an adverse way was derived from the applicant s oral evidence at hearing  and from general country information about Falun Gong practitioners and document fraud in China  The information from the oral evidence at hearing falls within the exception in s  A b    as it was information  that the applicant gave for the purpose of the application   The information from the general country information falls within the exception in s  A a    as it was  not specifically about the applicant or another person and is just about a class of persons of which the applicant or other person is a member  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v NAMW   FCAFC   at           FCAFC         FCR       citedSBBS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The asserted basis for the allegation of bias was that the Tribunal did not believe the appellant  His Honour noted this to be a circular and unconvincing argument  There was no evidence of bias or bad faith in the decision of the Tribunal  SBBS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at         His Honour then considered whether the Tribunal refused the application without evidence  rejected this and had regard to the positive duty imposed on the Tribunal by s   of the Act to be positively satisfied that the relevant criteria for grant of a visa had been satisfied   The third ground was dismissed by his Honour who found that the independent country information was irrelevant relating as it did to the Chinese Government crackdown on Falun Gong  the situation in Tianjin where the appellant claims to have taken up Falun Gong in    The information concerned the years     and as his Honour found could not therefore be characterised as being out of date   The Notice of Appeal contains the following grounds         The Tribunal failed to carry out its statutory duty  The Tribunal failed to notify me the reason or part of the reasons for affirming the decision  The Tribunal failed to inform me why the information is relevant to my application  and I was not given an opportunity to comment upon the reason         The Tribunal had bias against me and did not consider all the information and evidence provided for my application for a protection visa  The Tribunal misunderstood my claims and could not consider my application according to s  R of the Migration Act         Transcribed without alteration    The first ground  in effect  alleges a breach of s  A of the Act   The second asserts bias  that the Tribunal failed to consider all the information which accompanied the protection visa application and that it misunderstood his claims and could not consider his application according to s  R of the Act    The respondent made the following submissions  It is well established that bias  an aspect of bad faith  is a serious allegation involving personal fault on the part of the decision maker  It must be clearly proved by evidence  It is rare for a Court to find that an administrative decision maker acted in bad faith  especially where the only thing said to be in support of this is the decision record  see SBBS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs     ALR   at       There is no evidence of bias  or apprehended bias  in any of the material before the Court  The mere fact that the Tribunal found that the applicant was no credible  and did not believe the applicant s claims  does not establish bias on the part of the Tribunal member   This ground is not particularised  There is no evidence to support the allegation that the Tribunal misunderstood any of the applicant s claims citedO Brien v
