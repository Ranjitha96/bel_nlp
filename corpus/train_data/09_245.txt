Lamason v Australian Fisheries Management Authority   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedBienke v Minister for Primary Industries and Energy     ALR  The test for validity of a legislative instrument is  whether there is a  real connection  between the delegated legislation and the purpose for which the Parliament conferred the authority to make the law under challenge  Gummow J in Bienke v Minister for Primary Industries and Energy     ALR   at    The applicant contends that the  Relative Price Factor  derived for a fishing permit package for the northern inshore and Area E areas of the Fishery in item   in the table in s   of the Management Plan was derived by a method that was irrational  unreasonable and capricious  and was against the weight of evidence and submissions to the Authority  with the consequence that item   should be declared invalid  For the reasons which follow  the applicants  challenge to s   of the Management Plan fails  and the declaration of invalidity they seek will be refused  The Fishery And to the observation of Gummow J in Bienke v Minister for Primary Industries and Energy     ALR     at         Great caution must be shown in judicial review     of determinations resting upon factual matters where  i  the determinations in question were made after prolonged public debate and  ii  being legislative in character  the determinations were subject to disallowance by either House of Parliament and  iii  the disputed matters of fact turn upon expert knowledge and opinion  there is dispute between the experts  and there was no cross examination upon that conflict  In Bienke   Gummow J was concerned with a challenge by the owners of prawn trawlers to a management plan for the Northern Prawn Fishery promulgated in    The applicants argued  amongst other things  that a number of determinations by the relevant Minister relating to the plan and changes to it were ultra vires and unreasonable  It was also said that the plan was invalid  on the basis that it deprived the applicants of the ability to fish  which was  in effect  the indirect acquisition of property without providing for just terms as required by the Constitution   A  just terms  compensation claim was pleaded in the present case  but abandoned by the applicants appliedDirector of Animal and Plant Quarantine v Australian Port Ltd and Others   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlIn Director of Animal and Plant Quarantine v Australian Pork Ltd and Others   FCAFC         FCR     the Full Court of the Federal Court was concerned with the review of an administrative decision to grant a Permit to import pig meat  pursuant to the ADJR Act  It was contended that the recommendation of the Import Risk Analysis Report was infected by Wednesbury unreasonableness  The nature of the decision making function in that case was described by Heerey and Lander JJ at       The legislation does not suggest that quarantine decisions are to be made on an assumption that every scientific fact is known about every conceivable disease or pest that might be introduced into Australia  or that such decision are to be delayed until all such facts are discovered and accepted  On the contrary  quarantine decisions have to be made in the existing state of knowledge  Imponderables have to be weighed and value judgements made  No specific criteria are laid down  other than the condition to be established must limit the level of quarantine risk to one which is  acceptably low  which necessarily assumes there will be some risk  At   Heerey and Lander JJ said        If in some steps  or sub steps  of the process in relation to PMWS the Panel used estimate  or analogy  or indeed speculation  the Panel might be guilty of unscientific procedures  However APL had to show that the ultimate decision was not just unreasonable  but so unreasonable that no other similarly qualified decision maker would have made it  That test necessarily allows for some degree of unreasonableness  Even if error in reasoning is disclosed  a conclusion of Wednesbury unreasonableness requires a major step further     Emphasis added   In the case of a legislative instrument  such as the present  the matter has to go even further than Wednesbury unreasonableness  The observations of their Honours at     have a resonance to the present proceedings        That process involved fact finding and the making of value judgments and risk assessments in a complex scientific setting  The good faith and scientific competence of those engaged in the task is not in question  While there is room for debate as to some aspects of the IRA Report  the Panel did not carry out its task irrationally or unreasonably  The Court is not empowered to adjudicate on the factual correctness or otherwise of the IRA Report citedMinister for Primary Industries   Energy v Austral Fisheries Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlSpigelman CJ referred  at   to the observations of Lockhart J in Minister for Primary Industries and Energy v Austral Fisheries Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     Delegated legislation may be declared to be invalid on the ground of unreasonableness if it leads to manifest arbitrariness  injustice or partiality  but the underlying rationale is that legislation of this offending kind cannot be within the scope of what Parliament intended in authorising the subordinate legislative authority to enact law citedMinister for Primary Industry and Energy v Davey     FCR  Gummow J noted  at   that the common law right or liberty to fish in the sea and in tidal navigable rivers is a public not a proprietary right  and as such  is amendable to abrogation or regulation by legislation  citing Minister for Primary Industry and Energy v Davey     FCR   at        In the context of the present case it is helpful to recall that par   of the Northern Fisheries Plan then under challenge set out the objectives and measures for obtaining them  Subparagraphs     and     stated        For the purposes of subsection  B  of the Act  the objectives of this plan are       a  to conserve the stocks of prawns in the area of the fishery   b  to reduce the fishing pressure on the stocks of prawns in the area of the fishery  and   c  to promote the economic efficiency of the fishery          The measures for attaining the objectives specified in paragraph     shall include       a  the determination of the fishing capacity of the fishery   b  the determination of the number of units of fishing capacity for the fishery available to a unit holder for allocation and assignment  which shall be renewable and transferable  and   c  the facilitation of the withdrawal of units and boats from the fishery    Emphasis supplied  Gummow J  at   said that certain determinations by the Minister were said to be invalid  a  because they were made ultra vires  and  b  because the determinations were unreasonable and irrational in the Wednesbury sense  or  disproportionate   At   Gummow J said        when the issue concerns not the exercise of discretion by the validity of delegated legislation  the question is     whether there is a  real connection  between the delegated legislation and the purpose for which the Parliament conferred the authority to make the law under challenge appliedMurrumbidgee Groundwater Preservation Association Inc v Minster for Natural Resources   NSWCA  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  htmlA case not dissimilar in principle to the present was Murrumbidgee Groundwater Preservation Association Inc v Minister for Natural Resources   NSWCA    In that case  the Minister had made a Water Sharing Plan for the Lower Murrumbidgee Groundwater Sources   which was a legislative instrument under the Water Management Act    NSW   The appellant  who was an association of primary producers  unsuccessfully challenged the validity of the Plan in the Land and Environment Court and appealed to the Court of Appeal on a number of grounds  including one based on irrationality  Spigelman CJ  with whom Beazley and Tobias JJA agreed  said  at     The Appellant s case on irrationality has its factual foundation in the limited interconnectivity within the aquifers the subject of the Plan  Although it is accepted that each aquifer is a single geological formation  it is submitted that the absence of interconnectivity is such that it is not rational to treat this formation as a single body of water for the purposes of a plan under the Act  At   his Honour summarised the contentions by the appellant     Under this plan  the transferor will receive a windfall by obtaining consideration for an asset  being the entitlement which they may never have used and which in the future could not use  The transfer of entitlements provides no environmental benefit  it could never have been utilised  but the holder of the licence receives financial consideration  which may be quite substantial  from the transferee who can utilise the licence  Continuing    The effect is that the transferee suffers a financial detriment which is to the benefit of the transferor  In these circumstances  although there may be windfall gains and losses  there is no net benefit for the acquifer or the environment               the absurdity of the Plan is emphasised by the fact that many of those who will acquire water will have expended considerable sums in developing their properties  in some cases with the active encouragement of the government  only to now pay money for water rights without which part of their capital investment in infrastructure may be lost               the applicants submit that the consequences of the Plan is to give a windfall to some and inflict financial hardship on others  And at         the limited degree of interconnectivity which is accepted by all experts leads to a level of unfairness that indicates irrationality or illogicality  Where there is a challenge to the exercise of a statutory power on the basis of irrationality or unreasonableness  Spigelman CJ said  at         Perhaps the most appropriate formulation is whether the decision is  illogical  irrational or lacking a basis in findings or inferences of fact supported on logical grounds  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Ex Parte Applicant S     HCA         ALJR   at   and         consideredP W Adams v Australian Fisheries Management Authority     ALD  Branson J observed in P W Adams v Australian Fisheries Management Authority     ALD     at       Plainly  there is a difference between  maximising economic efficiency in the exploitation of fisheries resources  and maximising the economic efficiency of individual participants in the fishing industry  The objectives of the AFMA are objectives intended to be pursued in the public interest  they are not intended to require AFMA to pursue  assuming that it would be possible for it to do so  the separate interests of individual participants in the fishing industry  Of course  in many circumstances  the respective interests of individual participants in the fishing industry and the public interests which AFMA is required by its objectives to pursue in the performance of its functions will be consistent  In some circumstances they will not be consistent consideredSecretary  Department of Primary Industries and Energy v Collins   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlHeerey J in Secretary  Department of Primary Industries and Energy v Collins   FCA         FCR   was concerned with the Great Australian Bight Trawl Fishery Preliminary Management Plan  determined by the Minutes under s  B of the Fisheries Act    Cth   His Honour said  at     The starting point is the proposition that the Plan has the force of law           Parliament clearly intended that a plan of management      should create detailed rights and obligations in relation to a fishery     The provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act concerning tabling before and disallowing by Parliament are to apply      Thus a plan of management stands on quite a different legal footing from policy statements or guidelines  The Minister and the Secretary  like all other citizens  are bound by the law contained in a plan of management just as they are by the law in the Act itself  It is now accepted that the Management Plan is a legislative instrument  and is amenable to challenge only under the Judiciary Act   It was suggested that item   of the s   table of the Management Plan was not  reasonably appropriate and adapted to obtain the objectives  of maximising economic efficiency set out in s   of the FM Act citedSouth Australia v Tanner   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlAdapting the words of Gummow J  the question of validity in the present case is whether the determination of the Management Plan goes beyond what could reasonably be adopted for the purpose of allocating statutory fishing rights in the Fishery and promoting the economic efficiency of the Fishery  it not being enough that the Court itself might think that the Plan as amended inexpedient or misguided  see South Australia v Tanner   HCA         CLR   at   citedWilliams v Melbourne Corporation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlSpigelman CJ said  at     With respect to a power to make a plan of the character under consideration in the present case  I find particularly helpful the formulation of Sir Owen Dixon in Williams v Melbourne Corporation   HCA         CLR   at      To determine whether the bylaw is an exercise of a power  it is not always enough to ascertain the subject matter of the power and consider whether the bylaw appears on its face to relate to that subject  The true nature and purpose of the power must be determined and it must often be necessary to examine the operation of the bylaw in the local circumstances to which it is intended to apply  Notwithstanding that ex facie there seemed a sufficient connection between the subject of the power and that of the bylaw  the true character of the bylaw may then appear to be such that it could not reasonably have been adopted as a means of attaining the ends of the power  In such a case the bylaw will be invalid  not because it is inexpedient or misguided  but because it is not a real exercise of the power  Spigelman CJ adopted the words of Dixon J  as he then was  in Williams v Melbourne Corporation   which involved a power to regulate traffic  Dixon J said  at         The ultimate question in the present case appears to me to be whether  when applied to the conditions of Melbourne  the bylaw involves such an actual suppression of the use of the streets for the purposes of the necessary transit of an important and ordinary commodity as to go beyond any restraint which could be reasonably adopted for the purpose of preserving the safety  convenience and proper facility of traffic in general  Spigelman CJ made the important observation  at     It is always necessary to commence with the identification of the particular statutory power  understood in its context  and to assess the exercise of that power against the high standard of unreasonableness or of irrationality which the outcome must reach before the Court can legitimately infer that the legal limits to the exercise of the power have not been observed so that  to adopt the formulation from Williams v Melbourne Corporation quoted above  the Plan  could not reasonably have been adopted as a means of attaining the ends of the power  and  therefore   is not a real exercise of the power   Spigelman CJ said  at     Inevitably  when significant changes are made to an established regulatory regimes  there will be winners and losers  Considerations of equity are quintessentially matters for political decision making  I am not satisfied that anything in the nature  scope and purpose of the Act prevents the Minister from implementing a scheme which operates to the detriment of some persons and to the advantage of others  in a manner not determined by availability of water but by broader considerations of what the Minister regards as equitable  And  at         What is fair or unfair in such a context is a matter on which reasonable minds can differ  In view of the conflicting interests involved  a broad brush approach of general application is not  in my opinion  irrational
