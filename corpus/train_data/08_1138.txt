cth aat  html  The applicant made a request to the respondent  a court created under Ch III of the Constitution   for certain documents  The respondent declined to grant that request  The applicant s request for internal review of the decision was granted  but the decision was affirmed after internal review  The applicant then sought review of the respondent s decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal  the Tribunal   The Tribunal s decision was to affirm the decision under review  The decision and reasons for decision  which are designated as Bienstein and Family Court of Australia   AATA       AAR     were given on   April    The applicant appealed to this Court from that decision of the Tribunal  By s   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth   the AAT Act   a party to a proceeding before the Tribunal may appeal to this Court from a decision of the Tribunal in that proceeding  but the right of appeal is limited to a question of law   The object of the FOI Act is set out clearly in s       The object of this Act is to extend as far as possible the right of the Australian community to access to information in the possession of the Government of the Commonwealth by   a  making available to the public information about the operations of departments and public authorities and  in particular  ensuring that rules and practices affecting members of the public in their dealings with departments and public authorities are readily available to persons affected by those rules and practices  and  b  creating a general right of access to information in documentary form in the possession of Ministers  departments and public authorities  limited only by exceptions and exemptions necessary for the protection of essential public interests and the private and business affairs of persons in respect of whom information is collected and held by departments and public authorities  and  c  creating a right to bring about the amendment of records containing personal information that is incomplete  incorrect  out of date or misleading    It is the intention of the Parliament that the provisions of this Act shall be interpreted so as to further the object set out in subsection   and that any discretions conferred by this Act shall be exercised as far as possible so as to facilitate and promote  promptly and at the lowest reasonable cost  the disclosure of information   Section   provides  For the purposes of this Act   a  a court shall be deemed to be a prescribed authority   b  the holder of a judicial office or other office pertaining to a court in his or her capacity as the holder of that office  being an office established by the legislation establishing the court  shall be deemed not to be a prescribed authority and shall not be included in a Department  and  c  a registry or other office of a court  and the staff of such a registry or other office when acting in a capacity as members of that staff  shall be taken as a part of the

Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC       FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In Bizuneh v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC       FCR     a Full Court rejected an application for leave to appeal from a direction of a judge to a registrar under O   r  A of the Federal Court Rules  the Federal Court Rules   not to accept an application and accompanying affidavit for filing  At     the Full Court said  No judicial act is carried out by the Registrar in so acting  The Registrar continues to perform an administrative function  albeit that the act of the Registrar may bear upon the ultimate performance of judicial power  Insofar as r  A gives the Registrar a discretion to seek a direction from a judge as to performance of the Registrar s duties  the direction sought is administrative in character  It is a direction provided by a judge to assist the Registrar in the task of administration and is not a determination of right made by a judge after hearing or considering arguments or submissions upon an application to the Court seeking the exercise of judicial power  Rule  A provides for a judge to act in aid of administration of the Court  There is no application to the Court by motion or otherwise and no requirement for a party to be heard  It involves determination of administrative obligations with respect to documents presented to a Registrar having regard to the character of the documents on their face  No order or decree intended to bind a party and no determination of right is made by a judge where assistance is provided to a Registrar under r  A   It appears to follow from the Full Court s judgment that both the decision of the registrar to seek a direction of a judge  and the decision of the judge to direct the registrar  are decisions of an administrative character  Unfortunately  the Full Court does not seem to have had the benefit of citation of the apparently contrary view of Toohey J in Letts   In Paramasivam v Randwick City Council   FCA     Sackville J took the view that he was bound by Bizuneh to decide that both the registrar seeking a direction of a judge  and the judge giving the direction  pursuant to O   r  A of the Federal Court Rules   made decisions of an administrative character  At     his Honour referred to Edwards   Letts and Bizuneh  At     his Honour drew attention to the fact that the Full Court had not referred to Letts   and expressed doubts about the correctness of the reasoning in Bizuneh   whilst acknowledging that it was binding on him  His Honour made orders adding as respondents to the proceeding before him the deputy registrar who had made the decision to seek the direction of a judge and the judge who gave the direction to refuse to accept the documents  Subsequently  in Paramasivam v Randwick City Council  No      FCA     effectively by consent  Sackville J set aside both the decision to seek a direction  and the direction  on the ground referred to in s  d  of the ADJR Act   apparently on the basis that his Honour had foreshadowed in the first judgment at      This was that both the registrar and the judge had taken into account other documents previously filed by the same applicant  whereas O   r  A requires that the originating process  appears   on its face to be an abuse of the process of the Court or to be frivolous or vexatious  citedDrake v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALR   The applicant was wrong to suggest that  simply because the respondent did not adhere to its original decision  the Tribunal should have ordered it to make a new decision  The Tribunal was required to review the decision of the respondent itself  and to make the correct or preferable decision in accordance with the law and on the facts as it found them after its hearing  See Drake v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALR   at   per Bowen CJ and Deane J  The fact that the respondent appeared to have retreated somewhat from its original decision did not mean that the decision had disappeared  Nor did the Tribunal possess statutory power to compel the respondent to make another decision on this basis  Section  D of the AAT Act confers on the Tribunal power to remit the decision to the person who made it for reconsideration  That power does not include power to compel the original decision maker to make a decision different from that made in the first place   Section  D  provides that  if the decision is remitted  the original decision maker may affirm or vary the decision  or set aside the decision and substitute a new decision   There is no requirement that the Tribunal exercise the power to compel reconsideration  only a discretion to do so  No error of law can result from a failure to exercise the power   In principle  there is nothing wrong with the Tribunal encouraging the parties to an application for review to resolve their differences  Section  C of the AAT Act makes specific provision for the Tribunal to act in accordance with agreement reached between the parties or their representatives as to the terms of a decision of the Tribunal  if it is satisfied that a decision in those terms or consistent with those terms would be within the powers of the Tribunal  It may be that  in the circumstances  when the applicant had made clear a number of times her intention to press for a decision of the Tribunal  rather than to agree to limiting her access to documents to those available under the Family Court Rules or to those offered to her by the respondent  the Tribunal went too far and delayed too long in attempting to persuade her to settle  This could not be characterised as an error of law  At the most  it was a well intentioned but perhaps misguided attempt to have the proceeding resolved otherwise than by a decision of the Tribunal   To the extent to which there was delay in the Tribunal proceeding  the delay appears to have been partly due to the applicant s illness  and to her consequent inability or unwillingness to move along her end of the proceeding  Whatever the objects of the FOI Act may say about promptness  it is not an error of law for the Tribunal not to hear and determine an application within any particular period after the filing of the application  Managing the large number of cases that come before the Tribunal is challenging enough without imposing on the Tribunal deadlines in particular types of cases  The object of promptness in s   of the FOI Act is exhortatory  not mandatory  Lack of promptness is not error of law discussedFingleton v The Queen   HCA       CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The senior member then set out the terms of s   of the FOI Act   and a passage quoted from the judgment of the High Court in Fingleton v The Queen   HCA       CLR   at   per Gleeson CJ  to which I refer below  The senior member then referred to MacKeigan v Hickman     SCR     to which Gleeson CJ had referred in Fingleton   for its comments by the Supreme Court of Canada on the limits of the power to investigate the reasons for a decision to assign a judge to a case  The senior member then continued     The Tribunal has considered the nature of the documents relevant to Ms Bienstein s request  and finds that the documents refer to organisational matters such as Court lists and the assigning of judicial officers to particular cases  As noted in Fingleton  these are matters affecting litigants and the public  and are intimately related to the independent and impartial administration of justice  They are not documents of internal administration     For these reasons under s   of the FOI Act the Tribunal finds that the relevant documents are not documents that relate to matters of an administrative nature  so the FOI Act does not apply to the request for access to the documents   The questions of law specified in the applicant s notice of appeal are in the following terms    Whether a Respondent who claims to have grounds for challenging the Tribunal s jurisdiction is compelled either to issue the challenge and have it determined at the outset or submit to the jurisdiction for the duration of the proceeding    What bearing  if any  do the following statutory provisions have on the s   enforceable right of access provision of the Freedom of Information Act         a  Sections       and   FOI Act   generally                      b  Order   Rule   Family Court Rules in the context of Tribunal   proceedings regarding an FOI request to the Family Court of   Australia for access to one s own case management documents                Whether it is Tribunal s role in Part VI FOI Review proceedings to determine which of the Applicant s rights in respect of the request remain to be satisfied and promptly direct the Respondent to satisfy those rights in a timely manner    Whether an Applicant in Part VI Review proceedings has an immediate right to receive in the Respondent s s   statement full and honest disclosure of the Respondent s relevant document holding  an account of the steps the Respondent took in the search and decision making process  and documents to evidence the account given    Whether documents relating to the case management of matters before the Family Court of Australia necessarily fall within the s   FOI Act exclusion and whether the High Court decision in Fingleton v The Queen   HCA     June   supports such a conclusion  It is clear that the notice of appeal was prepared without legal assistance  The questions of law are framed in an abstract way  rather than by reference to specific issues decided by the Tribunal or to specific reasons given by it for its decision  Grounds   and   clearly raise the effect of s   of the FOI Act   and therefore raise for consideration the correctness of the Tribunal s decision that all of the possible documents sought in the applicant s request did not relate to matters of an administrative nature  The other questions of law raised concern aspects of the way in which the Tribunal dealt with the applicant s application for review of the respondent s decision  prior to the Tribunal making its decision  These concerns of the applicant are reflected in the orders sought in her notice of appeal  which are expressed in the following terms    Declare that documents related to the management of cases proceeding in a court or tribunal are documents of the court or tribunal relating matters of an administrative nature and  as such  fall outside the s   FOI exclusion    Declare that the Tribunal s role during the course of proceedings and when making a final decision is to promote and enforce the Applicant s rights in relation to the FOI request in question    Declare that the Tribunal has an obligation to ensure that Respondents comply fully and without undue delay with provisions of s   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act     Directed the Respondent to file an appropriately amended s   statement  incorporating an amended decision with schedule of all documents within scope of the request that had been located  an account of the searches it had conducted and objective documentary evidence in support of the account    Set aside the Tribunal decision and remit the matter to be dealt with according to law        Make a costs order in favour of the Applicant   The concern of the applicant with the manner in which her request for access to documents was dealt with by the respondent  both initially and while it was pending in the Tribunal  is reflected in the grounds advanced in the notice of appeal  These grounds cover approximately six pages  The applicant sets out in some detail the history  which I have set out above  including some substantial quotes from correspondence and other documents  Woven into this history are indications that the applicant takes issue with various statements made on behalf of the respondent and with the course taken by the Tribunal in relation to her application to review  She also clearly takes issue with the view of the respondent  and that of the Tribunal  in relation to the application of s   of the FOI Act    As I have said in   the Tribunal relied on a passage quoted from the judgment of Gleeson CJ in Fingleton v The Queen   HCA       CLR   at     where his Honour said  The answer to that question  and to the respondent s argument  requires closer examination of s   of the Magistrates Act   In truth it covers a number of matters closely related to issues of judicial independence  Sub sections   and   of s   cover the whole range of matters relevant to the orderly and expeditious exercise of the jurisdiction and powers of the Magistrates Courts  and include the organising of court lists  the allocation of magistrates to particular localities  and the assigning of magistrates to particular work  Arrangements of that kind are not merely matters of internal administration  They affect litigants and the public  Within any court  the assignment of a judicial officer to a particular case  or a particular kind of business  or a particular locality  is a matter intimately related to the independent and impartial administration of justice  This was the basis of the decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in Rajski v Wood  where it was held that the nomination or allocation of a judge to hear a particular case was not justiciable  As was pointed out in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang  where it is the function of a head of jurisdiction to assign members of a court to hear particular cases  the capacity to exercise that function  free from interference by  and scrutiny of  the other branches of government is an essential aspect of judicial independence  The same may be said of the capacity to exercise that function free from the threat of civil or criminal sanctions   When viewed in the context of the judgment of Gleeson CJ  this passage may not lead to the conclusion that the Tribunal drew from it   In Fingleton   the Chief Magistrate of Queensland had been convicted of the offence of unlawful retaliation against a witness under s  B of the Criminal Code  Qld   the Criminal Code    The facts were that the Chief Magistrate had determined that a magistrate should be transferred to Townsville  The magistrate filed an application for review of that determination  The magistrate wrote to the Magistrates Association  seeking assistance with her application  A Co ordinating Magistrate  who was also Vice President of the Magistrates Association  provided an affidavit to assist the magistrate in the review proceeding  The Chief Magistrate then sent to the Co ordinating Magistrate a letter calling on him to show cause why he should not be removed from the position of Co ordinating Magistrate  The letter referred specifically to the affidavit in support of the magistrate s review application   On appeal to the High Court  there was raised for the first time s   of the Criminal Code   which provided  Except as expressly provided by this Code  a judicial officer is not criminally responsible for anything done or omitted to be done by the judicial officer in the exercise of the officer s judicial functions  although the act done is in excess of the officer s judicial authority  or although the officer is bound to do the act omitted to be done   The power the exercise of which by the Chief Magistrate gave rise to the charge was found in s   of the Magistrates Act    Qld   the Magistrates Act    Particularly relevant was the express power in s  d    of nominating a magistrate to be a Supervising Magistrate or a Co ordinating Magistrate for the purpose of the allocation of work of the Magistrates Court  In conjunction with s   of the Acts Interpretation Act    Qld  the power to appoint included a power to remove  It was also necessary to consider s  A of the Magistrates Act   which provided  A magistrate has  in the performance or exercise of an administrative function or power conferred on the magistrate under an Act  the same protection and immunity as a magistrate has in a judicial proceeding in a Magistrates Court   One of the issues determined by the High Court in Fingleton was whether  in combination  s  A of the Magistrates Act and s   of the Criminal Code gave immunity to the Chief Magistrate in exercising the power given to her by s  d  of the Magistrates Act   In his reasons for judgment  Gleeson CJ dealt at length with this issue  At     his Honour summarised the competing contentions on the issue  The argument for the appellant in this Court was that s   of the Magistrates Act conferred on the appellant as Chief Magistrate a series of administrative functions and powers  that she acted in the performance or exercise of those powers  that she had the same protection and immunity as she had in the exercise of her judicial functions  and that  except as expressly provided by the Code  she was not criminally responsible for anything done by her in the exercise of her administrative functions  even if the act done was in excess of her administrative authority  The argument for the respondent turned upon a question of construction of s  A and  in particular  the words  administrative function or power conferred on  a  magistrate under an Act   The respondent submitted that those words did not cover s   of the Magistrates Act itself  The argument called in aid two considerations  one textual  the other related to the rationale of immunity   His Honour then proceeded to deal with what he described as the textual consideration  This involved the question whether the phrase  under an Act  in s  A of the Magistrates Act referred only to functions or powers conferred on magistrates by legislation other than the Magistrates Act   or whether it included such powers and functions conferred by the Magistrates Act itself  By contrast  the consideration related to the rationale of immunity involved a comparison of the sorts of functions and powers conferred by s   of the Magistrates Act with the sorts of functions and powers conferred by various other statutes  as to which there was a need for the protection of magistrates from interference with their independence in the decision making process  The question that Gleeson CJ answered in the passage from his judgment  which I have quoted in   above  is posed in   of his Honour s judgment  Such independence is important in relation to the exercise by magistrates of the various responsibilities conferred on them by other Acts of the kind set out above  What  the respondent asks  does it have to do with matters of internal court administration and discipline of the kind dealt with by the Magistrates Act itself  It is to be noted that  in the passage quoted in   above from his Honour s judgment  Gleeson CJ described s   of the Magistrates Act as covering a number of matters  closely related to issues of judicial independence   In other words  they were not themselves issues of judicial independence  but closely related  His Honour referred to the organising of court lists  the allocation of magistrates to particular localities and the assigning of magistrates to particular work  In saying that arrangements of that kind  are not merely matters of internal administration  but that they  affect litigants and the public  his Honour was not saying that those matters fell within the exercise of judicial power  Rather  Gleeson CJ was underlining the public importance of these aspects of court administration  because of their close relationship to issues of judicial independence  Following the passage quoted in   above  in   of his Honour s reasons for judgment  Gleeson CJ said  The responsibilities conferred upon a Chief Magistrate by s   would cover some mundane issues of a kind that arise in the administration of any substantial organisation  On the other hand  some of those responsibilities  and especially those involving decisions which directly or indirectly determine how the business of Magistrates Courts will be arranged and allocated  concern matters which go to the essence of judicial independence  The selection of supervising and Co ordinating Magistrates is a matter that falls into that category  It is  therefore  incorrect to say that the functions and powers conferred on the Chief Magistrate by s   are unrelated to the rationale for the immunity in question  As to some of those functions the rationale is directly relevant  As to some it may be of no relevance  or of limited relevance  As to others  its relevance may depend upon the circumstances   In Fingleton at   McHugh J expressed his agreement with the reasons of Gummow and Heydon JJ with respect to the issue relevant to this case  At     Gummow and Heydon JJ said  The appeal in this Court thus turns upon the construction of s  A of the Magistrates Act   The submissions for the respondent fix upon the phrase therein  conferred on the magistrate under an Act   The respondent seeks to introduce a limitation upon those words so that the phrase is to be understood as if it read  under any Act other than this Act   Section   of the Magistrates Act conferred upon the appellant a range of administrative functions or powers  They included the nomination of Co ordinating Magistrates  the allocation of magistrates to particular localities and the power of reprimand  Indeed  it was a demand made by the appellant upon a Co ordinating Magistrate to show cause why he should not be removed from that post which gave rise to the charge against her under s  B of the Code  Attainment of the evident purpose of s  A will be limited if it were to be given the qualified reading for which the respondent contends  For these reasons  which concern the construction of s  A  and those on this issue developed by the Chief Justice in his judgment  the appellant was not liable to be held criminally responsible for the conduct alleged against her   For reasons that he set out at     Kirby J came to the same conclusion on the question of judicial immunity  At   Hayne J expressed his agreement with the reasons of Gummow and Heydon JJ  Each of the members of the High Court other than Kirby J therefore expressed their agreement  directly or indirectly  with the reasons given by Gleeson CJ   What emerges from Fingleton   and particularly from the passage quoted by the Tribunal  of relevance to this case is the proposition that there will be powers and functions exercised and performed within a court  even by the judicial officers of that court  that are of an administrative nature  Some of those powers and functions will be such that  of their very nature  they are so close to the overriding consideration of judicial independence as to be an essential part of the adjudicative function  It follows that the exercise of those functions  although it might be termed  administrative  ought to be protected from scrutiny by other arms of government  or by members of the public  Not all of the powers and functions properly characterised as being of an administrative nature will be so closely related to judicial independence that they need this kind of protection  In some cases  it will be necessary to look at the particular exercise of a power  or the particular act or acts in performance of a function  in their context  to determine whether public or executive scrutiny of them would endanger the necessary independence  This accords with the sort of distinction expressed by Senator Evans when he moved the amendment that became ss   and   of the FOI Act   between documents relating to matters of an administrative nature  and documents the exposure of which to the public view would threaten the independence which is a necessary element of the exercise of adjudicative functions by courts and tribunals  It is this distinction that is of the highest relevance in determining the purpose  and therefore the proper construction  of s    and  incidentally  of s   of the FOI Act    Reference was made by counsel for the respondent to a number of other authorities  either on s   of the FOI Act or on similar legislation  It is necessary to look at those authorities  to see whether they provide any useful guidance to the construction of s     as relevant to this proceeding distinguishedLegal Aid Commission of Western Australia v Edwards     ALR   There is a line of authority  to which Deputy President Walker referred  concerning whether a determination that a court should accept documents for filing  or reject them as an abuse of the court s processes  falls within the phrase  decision of an administrative character  in the ADJR Act   In Legal Aid Commission of Western Australia v Edwards     ALR     Toohey J held that a decision of a deputy registrar of the Family Court of Western Australia to reject an application for taxation of a bill of costs  on the ground that the court did not have jurisdiction to deal with a dispute between the Legal Aid Commission and the solicitors for a legally aided party  was a decision of an administrative character  At     his Honour pointed out that the decision was not made under the direction of the court  apparently meaning under the direction of a judge  By contrast  in Letts v Commonwealth     FCR   at     Toohey J held that a registrar of the High Court  who sought the direction of a justice with respect to an attempt to file initiating process  had not made a decision of an administrative character  At   his Honour said  The Registrar was in truth exercising the jurisdiction of the High Court to control frivolous or vexatious applications  a jurisdiction that may be exercised through officers of the court as well as justices   His Honour distinguished Edwards on the basis that the decision the subject of Edwards  was not readily susceptible of review by a judge of that Court   It appears to follow from the Full Court s judgment that both the decision of the registrar to seek a direction of a judge  and the decision of the judge to direct the registrar  are decisions of an administrative character  Unfortunately  the Full Court does not seem to have

Registrar  Family Court of Australia  v Altman   FCA         FCR     the Full Court dealt with an appeal from a decision of the Tribunal  constituted by its then President  O Connor J  in Re Altman and Family Court of Australia     ALD    Her Honour had reached the conclusion that an unrevised transcript of reasons for judgment pronounced in open court by a judge of the respondent was a document that the respondent was required to give access to under s   of the FOI Act   Because the unrevised transcript was produced by the agency responsible for providing transcript of court proceedings  the case turns largely on the meaning of the expression  a document of the court  in s     and is therefore of little relevance to the present case  In the course of the Full Court s judgment  at   the Court did approve the conclusion of O Connor J that the unrevised transcript was not a document of an administrative nature  Clearly  the giving of reasons for judgment and the practice of revising the transcript of those reasons for publication as the reasons for judgment are at the very heart of the judicial process  and the ready availability of the unrevised transcript to the public could undermine the independence of the judiciary   Loughnan has since been discussed in a couple of decisions of the Tribunal  In Re O Sullivan and Family Court of Australia     ALD     Senior Member Dwyer dealt with a case in which access was sought to the handwritten notes of a Family Court counsellor  In her reasons  the learned senior member discussed Loughnan in the context of determining whether the counsellor s notes were documents of the court  Having concluded that they were  at   the senior member found that the notes were not a document relating to matters of an administrative nature  because of the professional duties of the counsellor  It is unnecessary to decide in the present case whether that conclusion was correct  In Re Simring and High Court of Australia   AATA       AAR     Deputy President Walker dealt with a request for access to a document created in the course of dealing with an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court  The learned deputy president took the view that  because the document had been brought into existence within the chambers of a judge  as part of the judicial deliberative process  it was a judicial document  and not a document relating to matters of an administrative nature  The deputy president regarded Loughnan as not in point  At   the deputy president referred to the words  relates to matters of an administrative nature  in s   of the FOI Act in the following terms  The language used is relatively flexible and focuses on the general nature of the document rather than on the presence in the document of any administrative features whatever  however insignificant they might be in relation to the document s general nature  Even if the document in issue dealt incidentally with some administrative matters

organisation citedMacKeigan v Hickman     SCR   The senior member then set out the terms of s   of the FOI Act   and a passage quoted from the judgment of the High Court in Fingleton v The Queen   HCA       CLR   at   per Gleeson CJ  to which I refer below  The senior member then referred to MacKeigan v Hickman     SCR     to which Gleeson CJ had referred in Fingleton   for its comments by the Supreme Court of Canada on the limits of the power to investigate the reasons for a decision to assign a judge to a case  The senior member then continued     The Tribunal has considered the nature of the documents relevant to Ms Bienstein s request  and finds that the documents refer to organisational matters such as Court lists and the assigning of judicial officers to particular cases  As noted in Fingleton  these are matters affecting litigants and the public  and are intimately related to the independent and impartial administration of justice  They are not documents of internal administration     For these reasons under s   of the FOI Act the Tribunal finds that the relevant documents are not documents that relate to matters of an administrative nature  so the FOI Act does not apply to the request for access to the documents distinguishedParamasivam v Randwick City Council   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  It appears to follow from the Full Court s

decision of the Tribunal  constituted by its then President  O Connor J  in Re Altman and Family Court of Australia     ALD    Her Honour had reached the conclusion that an unrevised transcript of reasons for judgment pronounced in open court by a judge of the respondent was a document that the respondent was required to give access to under s   of the FOI Act   Because the unrevised transcript was produced by the agency responsible for providing transcript of court proceedings  the case turns largely on the meaning of the expression  a document of the court  in s     and is therefore of little relevance to the present case  In the course of the Full Court s judgment  at   the Court did approve the conclusion of O Connor J that the unrevised transcript was not a document of an administrative nature  Clearly  the giving of reasons for judgment and the practice of revising the transcript of those reasons for publication as the reasons for judgment are at the very heart of the judicial process  and the ready availability of the unrevised transcript to the public could undermine the independence of the judiciary notfollowedRe Bartucciotto and Guardianship and Administration

Constitutional Court of South Africa  and cited the reference to  matters of administration bearing directly on the exercise of  the  judicial function  from Valente v The Queen     SCR   at    His Honour then said  The adjudicative function of a court  considered as an institution  was seen as comprehending matters such as the assignment of judges  sittings of the court and court lists  as well as related matters of allocation of court rooms and direction of the administrative staff engaged in carrying out that function  Judicial control over such matters was seen as an essential or minimum requirement for institutional independence  The distinction between adjudicative and administrative functions drawn in the context of discussions of judicial independence is not clear cut  Nevertheless  the powers conferred by s   of the Magistrates Act include powers that fall squarely within the rationale of the immunity in question   Gleeson CJ therefore held that the words  under an Act  in s  A of the Magistrates Act applied to the functions and powers given to the Chief Magistrate by s    Accordingly  s   of the Criminal Code was applicable to them and the appeal should be allowed
