The Suzlon companies argued that the evidence before me  from the part heard  but now resolved  motion which I dealt with on   November   together with the additional emails provided with written submissions after the further hearing of this application on   November   established a sufficient case for service outside the jurisdiction to satisfy the requirements of O   r  b  and  c   These requirements were summarised by Finn and Weinberg JJ and myself in Ho v Akai Pty Ltd  in liq      ACLC       FCAFC   at   in the following terms  As has been observed on many occasions  the prima facie case requirement has to be met at the outset  usually on an ex parte basis  and without the advantage of discovery and other procedural aids to the making out of a case  see e g  Merpro Montassa

S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at    For present purposes it is sufficient to say that a prima facie case for relief is made out if  on the material before the court  inferences are open which  if translated into findings of fact  would support the relief claimed  Western Australia v Vetter Trittler Pty Ltd  in liq      FCR   at    Or  to put the matter more prosaically as Lee J did in Century Insurance  in provisional liquidation  v New Zealand Guardian Trust   FCA        What the Court must determine is whether the case made out on the material presented shows that a controversy exists between the parties that warrants the use of the Court s processes to resolve it and whether causing a proposed respondent to be involved in litigation in the Court in Australia is justified   The Full Court noted that  because of the construction given in Bray v F Hoffman La Roche Ltd   FCAFC         FCR   by of the majority of the Court to what is now O   r  c  a finding that there was a prima facie case on one aspect of the claim against Mr Bangad has the consequence that he may be proceeded against on other bases as well  That is because it is only necessary that a prima

that on the material before me  inferences were open which  if translated into findings of fact  would support the relief claimed on each of the bases in the claims falling within items     and   described above  Ho   FCAFC         ACLC   at      On the material before me  the inference was available that Mr Bangad was unable to explain to his employer  or to Mr den Hartog  the commercial justification for the impugned documents and the relationship they evidenced between the Suzlon and Headway companies  If Mr den Hartog gave evidence to the effect of the material in his emails  an inference could be drawn that he  on behalf of Beluga  had been misled into entering into the transactions for the carriage of goods to Port Kembla on the basis that he understood that the Headway companies were associated with  rather than independent and at arms length from  the Suzlon companies  That inference would be supported  in the absence of explanation  by the fact that Suzlon Infrastructure guaranteed Headway Shipping s performance of the time charter  apparently before it was even made  If the transactions were at arms length  an explanation would be needed  which is not presently before me  as to why Suzlon Infrastructure would guarantee a time charter entered into by Headway Shipping with Beluga for the time charter of the Beluga Fantastic   There was no evidence of any reward or benefit passing to Suzlon Infrastructure or any other Suzlon company for this guarantee  The inference was also open that the Headway companies would earn a profit from performing the time charter and carrying the Suzlon companies  goods   It was difficult to see  in the absence of an explanation  the commercial rationale for the related company of the shipper and consignee  both Suzlon companies  guaranteeing the owners under a time charter of the vessel for its performance by the party  Headway Shipping  contracting with the shipper for the carriage of its goods to Australia

CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Of course  one story is good until another is told  Pontifical Society for the Propogation of Faith v Scales   HCA         CLR   at   per Dixon CJ  There may well be explanations for this state of affairs  But  I was satisfied  prima facie  that it was appropriate to permit service on Mr Bangad in India  This was because of the present absence of any explanation of the apparently uncommercial nature of the guarantee of the time charter and Mr Bangad s apparent involvement with the Headway companies when the impugned documents and the transactions  which they evidenced  were made  The prima facie case asserted by the Suzlon companies was further strengthened by the material indicating Mr Bangad s inability to explain to his employer his purposes for his entering into the impugned transactions and his inability  when confronted by Mr den Hartog  to explain why he had told Mr den Hartog that the Suzlon and Headway companies were associated  rather than at arms length  and why Mr den Hartog s letter accepting appointment as a director of Headway Shipping had been backdated   Of course  much of the material currently in evidence had been presented in circumstances of urgency and would not necessarily be admissible in its current form at a final hearing  However  I was satisfied that there was sufficient in the material before me to warrant drawing an inference that they were sufficient to support the exercise of the Court s power to permit service out of the jurisdiction on Mr Bangad   I was fortified in this view because the Headway had accepted that  whatever the strengths and weaknesses of the allegations made by the Suzlon companies  they raised a tribal issue which ought be determined at a five day hearing early next year  That is not to suggest that the Headway companies have not vigorously denied the allegations  as they have  Rather  it revealed the underlying litigious reality that the Suzlon companies had raised a case to be answered against the Headway companies  which have appeared  raising their involvement in the serious claims against Mr Bangad that would  if their case were accepted  translate into findings of fact that would support the grant of the relief they claim      I certify that the preceding forty nine   numbered paragraphs are a true
