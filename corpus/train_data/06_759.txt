cases which considered the question at an earlier stage when the jurisdiction of the court was challenged referred toPS Chellaram   Co Ltd v China Ocean Shipping Co   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The plaintiff is ordinarily resident outside Australia within the provisions of O   r  a  of the Federal Court Rules and  on the evidence  I am satisfied that it has no assets in Australia  The plaintiff did not contend to the contrary  nor did it argue that there has been delay in the bringing of the application  or that an order for security for costs will in any way stifle the proceedings  Furthermore  the plaintiff accepts that  in these circumstances  there must be weighty reasons why an order for security for costs should not be made  In PS Chellaram   Co Ltd v China Ocean Shipping Co   HCA         ALR   McHugh J said  at      However  for over two hundred years  the fact that a party  bringing proceedings  is resident out of the jurisdiction and has no assets within the jurisdiction has been seen as a circumstance of great weight in determining whether an order for security for costs should be made  Indeed  for many years the practice has been to order such a party to provide security for costs unless that party can point to other circumstances which overcome the weight of the circumstance that that person is resident out of and has no assets

www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  This principle is well established and has been applied on a number of occasions  see  eg  Logue v Hansen Technologies Ltd   FCA         FCR   at           per Weinberg J  Silveira v Australian Institute of Management   FCA   at   per Stone J  Balderrama v Commissioner for Australian Federal Police   FCA   at   per Emmett J referred toGartner v Ernst and Young  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The plaintiff s main  and indeed only  submission is that the defendant s application for security for costs should be refused because it is very unlikely  having regard to the merits of the respective claims  that the plaintiff will be ordered to pay the defendant s costs  It is clear that I cannot determine the merits of the plaintiff s claim and the defendant s set off and counterclaim on this application  However  the plaintiff s prospects of success are relevant on an application for security for costs  Gartner v Ernst and Young  No     FCA    In this case  it is not the defendant who is submitting that the plaintiff s claim appears weak and that this is a factor in favour of granting security  It is a plaintiff submitting that its case is so strong that security for costs should not be ordered   The plaintiff claims that it carried out repairs to the ship between   February   and   March    The plaintiff claims that the first instalment of the agreed price  namely  the sum of US  was paid prior to the ship leaving the shipyard  The balance of the agreed price  namely  the sum of US  was to be paid by the defendant within   days  It was not paid  and on the plaintiff s case the benefit of a discount was therefore lost and the sum of US  became due and payable by the defendant  Little was said about that matter in the submissions before me and I will proceed on the basis that  for the purposes of this application  the plaintiff s claim is for US    It seems to be common ground that  initially at least  it was a term of the repair contract that the work would be performed within a period of   days
