sometimes the case with self represented litigants has adopted a  scatter gun  approach to her case  The applicant has cited a significant number of grounds in support of her application for leave to appeal  However in my view key questions are those I have stated in the previous paragraph  and in that light it is clear that the application for leave to appeal must be dismissed because I find no fault in his Honour s reasoning     The decision of the Federal Magistrate was to refuse an application for a stay of proceedings listed for hearing on   December    The applicant s grounds in support of her application are largely irrelevant to that decision  In my view the only grounds of any substance or relevance to the application before me are      a  whether the Federal Magistrate erred in refusing to stay the proceedings because Ms George had earlier in   commenced other proceedings in the Supreme Court of Queensland  and  b  whether the Federal Magistrate erred in refusing to stay the proceedings because Ms George could not be ready for trial commencing   December        In relation to the Supreme Court proceedings  the applicant has  in my view  misunderstood the basis upon which his Honour found that the Federal Magistrates Court had exclusive jurisdiction to hear the matter which the applicant sought to bring before the Supreme Court of Queensland  I also consider that Ms George has misunderstood the relevance of principles articulated in Fencott v Muller and Philip Morris to these proceedings     Section   Bankruptcy Act provides    The Federal Court and the Federal Magistrates Court have concurrent jurisdiction in bankruptcy  and that jurisdiction is exclusive of the jurisdiction of all courts other than       a  the jurisdiction of the High Court under section

Greenwood J observed    In Scott v Bagshaw   FCA         FCR     the Full Court of this court again considered the source and scope of the court s jurisdiction in bankruptcy in proceedings in which the trustee of a family trust asserted an equitable charge over three properties in support of a loan made to the registered proprietors  a husband and wife  The trustees in bankruptcy of the estate of the husband denied any entitlement in the appellant trustee to an equitable mortgage of Torrens title land and contended that the appellant s claim related to a provable debt under s   of the Bankruptcy Act   The appellant required leave under s  b  to commence the proceeding    Applying the earlier authorities  the court described s   as the  seminal  source of the court s jurisdiction in

kinds of questions about the consequences  Many of those questions will depend for their answers on the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act   One class of such questions relates to the nature of the rights of persons to property  Austin J held that nothing in the Bankruptcy Act precludes the exercise in such cases of the well established jurisdiction of courts other than those mentioned in s    to determine and declare rights to property and make orders as to its destination   But that undoubted jurisdiction will yield to any aspect of the jurisdiction for determination and declaration of such rights which the Bankruptcy Act itself places in the hands of s   courts  In Scott v Bagshaw the Full Federal Court noted that among the matters so placed in the hands of those courts  is  applications to declare for or against the title of the trustee to any property   Because this is one of the matters s   of the Act requires  the Court  to hear an open court  it is identified as a

Supreme Court of New South Wales did not have jurisdiction to entertain a motion for leave pursuant to s  b  to continue the proceeding    The facts of this case bear strong similarities to those in Scott v Bagshaw   It appears that Ms George  who is a bankrupt  has sought to commence proceedings in the Supreme Court of Queensland  claiming that property which would otherwise fall within the terms of her bankruptcy  and to which accordingly her trustee in bankruptcy would have title  is actually the subject of a separate trust  and therefore outside the terms of her bankruptcy  In my view  this is clearly an  application to declare for or against the title of the trustee to any property  for the purposes of s  f  Bankruptcy Act   To paraphrase the words of the Full Court in Scott v Bagshaw at      the undoubted effect of an order being made in the terms sought by  Ms George  would be that a declaration would be made against the title of the  trustee in bankruptcy   Upon the  trustee in bankruptcy  becoming trustee  the title to the properties   became vested in them  subs   and s   of the Act  The consequence of any such order must therefore be that it would have a necessary adverse effect on the title of the  trustee in bankruptcy  to the extent that it established title in  Ms George as trustee   That is a matter that falls within the jurisdiction in bankruptcy citedFencott v Muller   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html   Any further or such order the Court deems fit     The application before me arises from a hearing in the substantive proceedings on   November   before Burnett FM  where Ms George sought a stay of hearing of particular matters listed for hearing on   December    The matters Ms George sought to have stayed in the substantive proceedings were as follows     The Heads of Agreement dated   February   remain valid and enforceable      As at   February   the legal and beneficial ownership of lot   on SP  County of Stanley  Parish of Moggill  title reference    the Landing Place property  vests in the applicant as trustee of the bankrupt estate      There is no trust in favour of Alexandra George  the bankrupt  or any other person in respect of the Landing Place property  and     As at   February   the legal and beneficial ownership of items listed in schedule A vests the trustee of the bankrupt estate     These matters related to paras       and   of the trustee in bankruptcy s Amended Application filed   November       The application for a stay in the substantive proceedings before his Honour resulted from the commencement of separate proceedings by Ms George in the Supreme Court of Queensland  the Supreme Court proceedings  in April    The Supreme Court proceedings involved claims by Ms George for declarations that she was trustee for her son in respect of property the subject of the substantive proceedings  in particular the Landing Place property  I note that the learned Federal Magistrate found  at   that there was a common substratum of facts and issues arising in relation to claims by Ms George in the Supreme Court of Queensland  and claims by the trustee in bankruptcy in the substantive proceedings  This finding is not disputed by the respondents before me  although in Court this morning Ms George disputed his Honour s finding that she was not necessarily in disagreement with this finding  I understand from submissions of Counsel for the trustee in bankruptcy that  after the trustee in bankruptcy was joined as a party to the Supreme Court proceedings by order of the Court  there was commonality between the parties to the Supreme Court proceedings and the parties to the substantive proceedings  The joinder of the trustee in bankruptcy to the Supreme Court proceedings is not in dispute     The application brought by Ms George before his Honour for a stay of the substantive proceedings was listed for hearing before his Honour on   November    It is not in dispute that  on that morning  Ms George applied for an adjournment of the stay application for a number of reasons including  in summary  a power cut which had affected her ability to be ready for the hearing  the fact that she had been served with material by the respondents approximately   hours   minutes late  and that she was ill on that day with medical certificates to support that assertion     The Federal Magistrate refused to adjourn the hearing of Ms George s application for a stay and  after hearing the application  refused it  His Honour s reasons appear in Fletcher   George  No     FMCA      Fletcher   George  No       In dismissing the application for a stay of the substantive proceedings the key findings of his Honour can be summarised as follows    There are presently on foot in the Federal Magistrates Court and the Supreme Court of Queensland proceedings which press common matters  The determination of title to the Landing Place property by either the Federal Magistrates Court or the Supreme Court of Queensland would determine the ultimate issues  If the title were properly attributable to the bankrupt the assets would vest in the trustee in bankruptcy  alternatively if the property were held by the bankrupt on trust other rights would follow  at         It was accepted by all parties save Ms George that the Federal Magistrates Court and the Federal Court were invested with exclusive jurisdiction under the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   Bankruptcy Act  and that the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction in respect of such matters  at    His Honour referred to Meriton Apartments Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales   FCAFC   as authority for the proposition that contests concerning matters within s   Bankruptcy Act fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts  His Honour found that the matter of real property and chattels as particularised in paras       and   of the Amended Application filed   November   involved questions of determining the title of the trustee in bankruptcy and must be settled in the federal courts  or alternatively falls within the accrued jurisdiction of the courts  at    Fencott v Muller   HCA         CLR   and Philip Morris Inc v Adam P Brown Fashions Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   were also relevant authorities     Notwithstanding the absence of commonality of parties because at that time the trustee in bankruptcy was not a party to the Supreme Court proceedings  the interest of the trustee in bankruptcy in the Supreme Court proceedings had been flagged and identified  and the trustee in bankruptcy has reserved his position   As I have already observed the trustee in bankruptcy was subsequently joined to the Supreme Court proceedings by order of that Court     On the basis that the Federal Magistrates Court was the proper Court to hear the matter involving dispute as to ownership of  inter alia   the Landing Place property  the application for a stay was refused     In relation to submissions of Ms George with respect to the pleadings not having been closed  and that there were further issues to be raised in the pleadings  his Honour found      o the trial in the substantive proceedings raised substantially the same issues that have been the subject of pleadings and interlocutory steps in the Supreme Court proceedings  o although Ms George claimed that she wished to amend her statement of claim again  as the plaintiff in the proceedings before the Supreme Court she had had significant opportunity since the commencement of that action to articulate her claim  and strictly speaking her cause of action notionally arose at the time of her bankruptcy three years ago  o the proceedings before the Federal Magistrates Court and the Supreme Court had an extensive history  Delays appeared largely to have been occasioned by the desire of Ms George to amend pleadings and raise new issues  o Ms George was a capable and articulate person  not in employment  and with ample time to prepare the case in the substantive proceedings  o evidence in the Supreme Court proceedings could be used in the substantive proceedings      The rights of the parties required resolution  particularly since Ms George had been bankrupt for almost three years and the costs to creditors were escalating  It was appropriate that the matter should proceed to trial on the due date    Fencott v Muller is not relevant because it relates to the Trade Practices Act    Cth     The matter properly belongs in the Supreme Court of Queensland because it is a civil matter comprising of contract law  law of equity  trusts and fraud and has no elements of bankruptcy to be determined  Parliament can not confer jurisdiction on a federal court with respect to a matter simply because it is associated even closely associated with one of the matters mentioned    The respondents are inappropriately forum shopping  The first respondent was aware of the Supreme Court proceedings for   months before filing an application in the Federal Magistrates Court    The applicant would not receive a fair trial in the Federal Magistrates Court   Leave to appeal

of separate proceedings by Ms George in the Supreme Court of Queensland  the Supreme Court proceedings  in April    The Supreme Court proceedings involved claims by Ms George for declarations that she was trustee for her son in respect of property the subject of the substantive proceedings  in particular the Landing Place property  I note that the learned Federal Magistrate found  at   that there was a common substratum of facts and issues arising in relation to claims by Ms George in the Supreme Court of Queensland  and claims by the trustee in bankruptcy in the substantive proceedings  This finding is not disputed by the respondents before me  although in Court this morning Ms George disputed his Honour s finding that she was not necessarily in disagreement with this finding  I understand from submissions of Counsel for the trustee in bankruptcy that  after the trustee in bankruptcy was joined as a party to the Supreme Court proceedings by order of the Court  there was commonality between the parties to the Supreme Court proceedings and the parties to the substantive proceedings  The joinder of the trustee in bankruptcy to the Supreme Court proceedings is not in dispute     The application brought by Ms George before his Honour for a stay of the substantive proceedings was listed for hearing before his Honour on   November    It is not in dispute that  on that morning  Ms George applied for an adjournment of the stay application for a number of reasons including  in summary  a power cut which had affected her ability to be ready for the hearing  the fact that she had been served with material by the respondents approximately   hours   minutes late  and that she was ill on that day with medical certificates to support that assertion     The

  Fletcher   George  No       In dismissing the application for a stay of the substantive proceedings the key findings of his Honour can be summarised as follows    There are presently on foot in the Federal Magistrates Court and the Supreme Court of Queensland proceedings which press common matters  The determination of title to the Landing Place property by either the Federal Magistrates Court or the Supreme Court of Queensland would determine the ultimate issues  If the title were properly attributable to the bankrupt the assets would vest in the trustee in bankruptcy  alternatively if the property were held by the bankrupt on trust other rights would follow  at         It was accepted by all parties save Ms George that the Federal Magistrates Court and the Federal Court were invested

the title of the trustee in bankruptcy and must be settled in the federal courts  or alternatively falls within the accrued jurisdiction of the courts  at    Fencott v Muller   HCA         CLR   and

bankruptcy was not a party to the Supreme Court proceedings  the interest of the trustee in bankruptcy in the Supreme Court proceedings had been flagged and identified  and the trustee in bankruptcy has reserved his position   As I have already observed the trustee in bankruptcy was subsequently joined to the Supreme Court proceedings by order of that Court     On the basis that the Federal Magistrates Court was the proper Court to hear the matter involving dispute as to ownership of  inter alia   the Landing Place property  the application for a stay was refused     In relation to submissions of Ms George with respect to the pleadings not having been closed  and that there were further issues to be raised in the pleadings  his Honour found      o the trial in the substantive proceedings raised substantially the same issues that have been the subject of pleadings and interlocutory steps in the Supreme Court proceedings  o although Ms George claimed that she wished to amend her statement of claim again  as the plaintiff in the proceedings before the Supreme Court she had had significant opportunity since the commencement of that action to articulate her claim  and
