  FCA  In Electrolux Home Products Pty Ltd v Australian Workers  Union   FCA     Electrolux No      the Court considered whether a claim that the employer contribute the equivalent of     per cent of an employee s weekly wage for a scheme to protect long service leave and other entitlements in an external trust deed pertained to the relationship of employer and employee  Justice Merkel at   conveniently summarised the relevant principles as follows    The general approach to be adopted in determining the characterisation of an industrial claim is to look at the substance of the demand and to identify the aspect that is central to the claim  or a critical part of it  having regard to the context in which the claim is made  see Re The Amalgamated Metal Workers Union of Australia  Ex parte Shell Co  of Australia Ltd   HCA         CLR     Shell   at      The claim is not to be construed as if it were a document creating legal rights and obligations  see Shell at    Finally  a claim can be properly characterised as pertaining to the relationship of an employer and its employees notwithstanding that parts of a claim that are machinery provisions giving effect to the claim  see Shell at   or ancillary aspects of it  see R v Portus  Ex parte Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd   HCA         CLR     Portus   at   may not pertain to that relationship  If a claim pertains to the requisite relationship in accordance with the above principles it is because it is in respect of a matter that pertains to that relationship followedElectrolux Home Products Pty Ltd v

http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlFurther  the union submits that the payments made by the employer to the insurer for income protection insurance should simply be seen as a reward for services  in the same way that a salary is a reward for services  The union relies upon the judgment of Steven J in Portus at   where his Honour said    The necessary quality of a subject matter

paid annual holidays or retirement benefits    would  I think  satisfy this requirement     As evidence that payments are merely another form of reward for services  the union emphasises the fact that the clause requires payments of premiums to be made by the corporation to the insurer only whilst the Maritime Officer is in the employ of the corporation  adopting the reasoning of the High Court in Re Manufacturing Grocers  Employees Federation of Australia and Another  Ex parte The Australian Chamber of Manufactures and Another   HCA         CLR     the Superannuation Case   at   questionedRe National Union of Workers  Re Agreement with Exel  Australia  Logistics Pty Ltd     IR  The union also relies upon the decision of the Full Bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in Re National Union of Workers  Re Agreement with Exel  Australia  Logistics Pty Ltd     IR    In that decision  the Full Bench upheld the validity of a clause pursuant to which an employer was to pay insurance premiums to an insurer nominated by the National Union of Workers for   Safety Net insurance    Such insurance was to protect future income  If an employee decided to terminate such insurance  an increment was to be added to the employee s wages  In the event of insurance premiums being increased  the employee was provided the right to terminate such insurance or to agree to a greater deduction from his or her wages  In its judgment  the Full Bench in Exel quoted in full paragraph   of Merkel J s judgment in Electrolux No      as set out at   in this judgment  and then continued at     The payee in this case is an insurer which has issued a policy over the income of the employee  Does such a payment relate to  an incident of the employment  We have no doubt that a scheme for income protection insurance  in which the employer pays the premium  pertains  In this case  there is an income protection insurance scheme which allows that if premiums rise the employer and the employee are to pay a share of the premium  In those circumstances at least  a provision for the employee s share of the premium to be deducted by the employer from the employee s wages and remitted to the insurer also pertains  We think that such a payment relates to an incident of the employment in the sense in which Menzies J  used that expression in Portus   For that reason cl     is a matter that pertains to the relevant relationship  The Full Bench in Exel equated a scheme for income protection insurance to a scheme for long service leave entitlement protection  However  there are significant conceptual differences between such schemes  For example  the long service leave benefits under consideration in Electrolux No    accrued during the long service of the employee and arose directly from the relationship of employer and employee in that the protection of the long service leave entitlement only arose if the employee became entitled to such benefit arising from their relationship with the employer  Such benefits are significantly different to a scheme as envisaged by the clause pursuant to which premiums are required to be paid to an insurer by an employer for possible future payments  the entitlement to which may arise out of a cause wholly unrelated to the employment  Further  the scheme in Electrolux No    sought to protect employees against the loss of entitlements which accrued as a result of the relationship between employer and employee  An entitlement connotes a right to a benefit  An income protection scheme does not protect employees against the loss of future entitlements  since it can hardly be said that an employee has a right to an income from the company if  because of a disability unconnected with their employment  they are unable to continue to work for the company  The decision of the Full Bench in Exel may possibly be explained upon the basis that the employer paid the premium for income protection insurance in lieu of remuneration to the employee in accordance with the reasoning of the High Court in the Superannuation Case at    This was demonstrated by the fact that if the employee chose to opt out of the insurance his or her wage was to be increased by     per cent  Unfortunately  the details of the proposed income protection insurance considered in Exel are not apparent from the judgments of the Full Bench  For example  it is not known whether the insurance was payable in respect of disability resulting from work related causes  or whether such causes were unrelated to employment  Without such information  it is not possible to accept the Full Bench s findings as stating a general principle that all employer sponsored schemes for income protection insurance necessarily arise out of the employment relationship  If the decision is intended to operate as a principle of universal application  this Court respectfully declines to follow it  The Court concludes that the income protection insurance scheme proposed by the clause cannot be said to be analogous to any of the schemes referred to by the authorities relied upon by the union  It is not sufficiently connected to the employment relationship and consequently cannot be said to pertain to the relationship between corporation in its capacity as an employer  and the Maritime Officers in their capacity as employees  The scope of the clause has the consequence that insurance benefits could be payable arising out of circumstances having no direct connection to the employee s relationship with the employer  For this reason  the clause cannot be justified even on the more abstract level that the preservation of a disabled employee s salary is a matter that pertains to employment  Income protection insurance as reward for services The findings so far have focused on the benefit which flows to the employee as a result of the income protection insurance payments  and whether that benefit is or is not sufficiently connected with employment  However  the union has also submitted that the proper characterisation of payment of premiums by the employer to an insurance company for income protection insurance is as a reward for services  As Steven J said in the passage cited above  the subject matter must still pertain to the relationship between the employer and employee  In the Superannuation Case payments were found to be in lieu of remuneration  thus providing a necessary link to the employer and employee relationship  This was also the case in Electrolux No    and Exel   In the absence of similar evidence that the payments of insurance premiums by the employer were a reward for services and in view of the Court s finding that the benefits do not pertain to the relationship between employee and employer  the claim that such payments are merely a reward for services cannot be sustained  Can the clause be read down followedThe Queen v Hamilton Knight and Others  Ex parte Commonwealth Steamship Owners Association   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn The Queen v Hamilton Knight and Others  Ex parte Commonwealth Steamship Owners Association   HCA         CLR   the High Court recognised that a causal connection between the employment and the injury was a vital consideration in determining whether workers compensation benefits could be found to be directly connected with the relationship between the employer and employee  see Dixon CJ at   Kitto J at    In the present case there is no necessity that there be a causal connection between the employment and the injury which triggers income protection insurance benefits  since the event giving rise to the insurance benefit may be unconnected with the employment  Immediately before the passage of Steven J in Portus cited at   of this judgment  his Honour said    Not every demand for reward for work performed will render the subject matter of the demand an industrial matter  The matter demanded must always pertain to the employer employee relationship     It follows that the mere assertion by the union that such payments of insurance premiums are a reward for services does not  without more  establish the necessary nexus to the employment relationship  The union s reliance on the High Court in the Superannuation Case at   where it said   the obligation of the employer to make payments ends with the relationship between him and his employee   is insufficient to establish that nexus  This particular passage was used in the context of distinguishing superannuation from pensions  which had been found in Hamilton Knight to not pertain to the relationship between employer and employee  rather than to provide a reason why superannuation could be considered to pertain to the relationship between employer and employee followedThe Queen v Portus and Another  Ex parte Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited and Others   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe union relies on the decision of the High Court of Australia in The Queen v Portus and Another  Ex parte Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited and Others   HCA         CLR   and subsequent decisions of the High Court and Federal Court of Australia considered hereunder which concern the relationship of employer and employee in support of its submission that income insurance protection arises out of the relationship between employer and employee  Further  the union submits that the payments made by the employer to the insurer for income protection insurance should simply be seen as a reward for services  in the same way that a salary is a reward for services  The union relies upon the judgment of Steven J in Portus at   where his Honour said    The necessary quality of a subject

fact that the clause requires payments of premiums to be made by the corporation to the insurer only whilst the Maritime Officer is in the employ of the corporation  adopting the reasoning of the High Court in Re Manufacturing Grocers  Employees Federation of Australia and Another  Ex parte The Australian Chamber of Manufactures and Another   HCA         CLR     the Superannuation Case   at    In Portus the High Court considered whether an attempt to impose an obligation on banks to pay union dues out of monies earned by employees in accordance with authorities given by such employees gave rise to an   industrial matter   as defined in s   of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act  The High Court in Portus found that the dispute arising out of such demand did not constitute an   industrial matter   as defined in s   since the payments for union dues were to be made by the employer only after income had been earned by the employee  Menzies J at   observed that the pivotal question was whether the imposition upon an employer of an obligation to make deductions for the purpose of making the subject payment   affects the industrial relationship of employers and employees    Having observed that the payment was to be made out of   earned salaries   his Honour at   said    In my opinion  the relationship that would be affected by such an obligation is a financial relationship of debtor and creditor arising from the earning of salary  not the industrial relationship in which the salary has been earned and has become payable  What is sought  in reality  is to make the employer the financial agent of the employee for the benefit of the association     In my opinion  the facts before the Court disclose a dispute which is not an industrial dispute  It is  in truth  a dispute between the association and the banks about whether or not the banks should perform for the association a dues collecting service   See also Walsh J at   and Steven J at    In the Superannuation Case the High Court found that a demand that employers contribute to a superannuation scheme related to an   industrial matter   within the meaning of s   of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act  At     their Honours said    First  it was said that the claims are for payments in respect of which employees will have no entitlement until the relationship of employer and employee has ceased to exist  The answer was made that the employee will receive a vested interest in the money paid  albeit not in possession  when the contributions are made by the employer to the fund  Whether or not this be so  the fact that there is no immediate benefit to employees from the payments to be made by employers  at any rate in any tangible form  does not in our view mean that those payments cannot pertain to the relations of an employee with his employer    payments do not cease to be remuneration for service during the relationship merely because the benefit from them is deferred until after the service has been finally performed and the relationship has ended  The obligation of the employer to make payments ends with the relationship between him and his employee unlike the obligation of an employer to pay a pension  which necessarily extends beyond the period of employment  It is in our view of no significance that an employee receives no immediate benefit  other than such interest as he might have in the superannuation fund  from the payment of contributions to the fund by his employer     Next  it was submitted that  since the payments claimed are to be made to the trustees of superannuation funds who are third parties  they involve relationships which are not those of employers and employees  It is obvious that the relationship between an employer and the trustee of a superannuation fund is not that of employer and employee  but that is hardly to the point  As the decision in Reg  v  Portus  Ex parte A N Z  Banking Group Ltd   shows  the identity of the payee is ordinarily not of significance in determining whether payments made by an employer to a person other than his employee constitute an industrial matter  But the opposite is the case where the payments are to a superannuation fund  because the character of the payee and the capacity in which he receives the payments provides the very connexion with the relationship between the employer and employee which is necessary if those payments are to be an industrial matter  Because the payments are to a superannuation fund  they form  to use the words of Menzies J   an incident of the employment    There is no reason why those payments should be seen in any other way than as contributions by an employer to a fund for the benefit of an employee  No doubt the payments represent money earned in an industrial relationship  but they do not represent money to which an employee is himself presently entitled     Footnotes omitted   In Electrolux Home Products Pty Ltd v Australian Workers  Union   FCA     Electrolux No      the Court considered whether a claim that the employer contribute the equivalent of     per cent of an employee s weekly wage for a scheme to protect long service leave and other entitlements in an external trust deed pertained to the relationship of employer and employee  Justice Merkel at   conveniently summarised the relevant principles as follows    The general approach to be adopted in determining the characterisation of an industrial claim is to look at the substance of the demand and to identify the aspect that is central to the claim  or a critical part of it  having regard to the context in which the claim is made  see Re The Amalgamated Metal Workers Union of Australia  Ex parte Shell Co  of Australia Ltd   HCA         CLR     Shell   at      The claim is not to be construed as if it were a document creating legal rights and obligations  see Shell at    Finally  a claim can be properly characterised as pertaining to the

Electrolux No      confirmed that the principles discussed in the preceding paragraphs apply to the Act  Gleeson CJ said at     The Court  in Portus at     approved statements in R v Kelly  Ex parte Victoria to the effect that  the relations of employers and employees  refers to the industrial relationship  and not to matters having an indirect  consequential and remote effect on that relationship   Footnote omitted   When considering whether the clause is connected with the relationship between an employer in its capacity as an employer and an employee in its capacity as an employee  the relationship had to be   direct and not merely consequential   in order to be the subject of an industrial dispute under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act  see the Superannuation Case at   see also Gleeson CJ s statement at   in Electrolux No      That is  the obligation imposed upon the corporation must arise inherently from the relationship of employer and employee  The union sought to equate the income protection insurance scheme with superannuation contributions as considered in the Superannuation Case   Superannuation contributions have been recognised as a form of payment in lieu of remuneration  see the Superannuation Case at   see also     wherein the Court referred to the fact that superannuation payments were commonly regarded as an aspect of the terms and conditions of employment  However  the benefit to be obtained under the clause and the circumstances in which it becomes payable are very different to a superannuation entitlement  for the reasons explained below  Firstly  the quantum of the benefit which accrues under superannuation entitlements is directly connected with the service performed by the employee  This is demonstrated by the fact that generally the greater the size of the employee s salary and the greater the length of time worked  the greater the superannuation benefit that accrues  even though receipt of such benefit is postponed until an event such as retirement occurs  and even though the exact dollar amount of the eventual benefit is unlikely to be the same as what was contributed by the employer  This was recognised by the High Court in the Superannuation Case when it said at         the superannuation schemes which are envisaged are to provide benefits either upon the accumulation principle so that the extent of those benefits will depend on the level of the contribution to the particular scheme  or as defined benefits which will be fixed    it is said that an employee will have a vested interest in the fund and thus in the contributions when they are made  although his interest will not fall into possession until he retires or otherwise establishes his entitlement  In its judgment  the Full Bench in Exel quoted in full paragraph   of Merkel J s judgment in Electrolux No      as set out at   in this judgment  and then continued at     The payee in this case is an insurer which has issued a policy over the income of the employee  Does such a payment relate to  an incident of the employment  We have no doubt that a scheme for income protection insurance  in which the employer

also the case in Electrolux No    and Exel   In the absence of similar evidence that the payments of insurance premiums by the employer were a reward for services and in view of the Court s finding that the benefits do not pertain to the relationship between employee and employer  the claim that such payments are merely a reward for services cannot be sustained  Can the clause be read down
