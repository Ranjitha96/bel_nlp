Industrial Court of New South Wales     IR   On   December   Greenwood J heard two motions in the Bank s Federal Court proceeding  By the first  the OMB parties sought an order pursuant to s   of the Cross vesting Act that the proceeding be transferred to the Supreme Court  By the second  the Bank parties sought an order that particular paragraphs of the defence of the OMB parties be struck out

Queensland Limited v Industrial Court of New South Wales  No      FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Subsequently  on   September   Logan J ordered that a number of paragraphs of the amended defence of the OMB parties be struck out  Bank of Queensland Limited v Industrial Court of New South Wales  No      FCA     On   September   the OMB parties filed an application for leave to appeal from the judgment of his Honour  Logan J  and that application  together with any ensuing appeal  will be heard by a Full Court on   November    In the meantime  Greenwood J vacated the dates for the hearing of the Bank s Federal Court proceeding commencing on   October   pending the hearing of the leave application and any ensuing appeal from Logan J s judgment   This is the state of play in the Bank s Federal Court proceeding at the time of writing these reasons   Traderight  New South Wales  Pty Ltd  Traderight   together with a number of individuals  commenced proceedings in the Equity Division of the Supreme Court claiming relief pursuant to ss   and   of the TPA  ss   and   of the FTA  NSW  s   of the IR Act  s  GM of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission Act    Cth   the ASIC Act  and damages for breach of contract and breach of duty  in relation to an OMB Agreement between the Bank and Traderight to establish an owner managed branch of the Bank in Castlereagh Street  Sydney  the Traderight Supreme Court proceeding   The amended statement of claim sets out a series of meetings between Bank representatives and a number of the plaintiffs  a sequence of contended representations at various times  reliance upon the representations  the falsity of those representations  detriment and consequential loss and a claim for remedial orders  The pleading contends that particular agreements including the OMB Agreement arising out of the particular events are susceptible of orders declaring the agreements void ab initio  among other orders    The OMB parties seek that all the matters  including the Bank s Federal Court proceeding  be heard by one court and one judicial officer  the Supreme Court  as being the only court that can hear all matters   Greenwood J did not agree to transfer the Bank s Federal Court proceeding to the Supreme Court  The next best thing the OMB parties can ask for  in order to avoid multiple trials of fact on the same issues and involving the common parties  witnesses etc  is that the rest of the related matters be transferred to the Supreme Court   Further  any proposal put forward in relation to cross vesting must deal with the reality of the Traderight proceedings and the fact that the only court that can hear the entirety of the Traderight proceedings is the Supreme Court   The Traderight proceedings are entirely unaffected by the Bank s Federal Court proceeding  The Traderight Group is not a party to that proceeding   The Bank s preliminary attempt to strike out the s   component of the Traderight proceedings failed  This means that  regardless of what Greenwood J decides in respect of the Bank s  constitutional challenge  the s   issue will be alive in the substantive proceedings in respect of at least the Traderight proceedings that are already before the Supreme Court   The only court that has jurisdiction to hear all aspects of the case is the Supreme Court  The Bank accepts that this Court does not have jurisdiction to hear the s   claims   When I put this to senior counsel for the Bank parties during the hearing of the motions  he responded   It s an issue which we ventilated with his Honour Logan J the week before last in the strike out application  It s a complex argument  We don t intend  if your Honour doesn t mind      to ventilate it fully before your Honour but we can tell your Honour it s been raised with his Honour Logan J as part of the strike out application   His Honour s  Logan J s  response to that ventilation is instructive  At   of his Honour s reasons  he observed   There is Full Bench authority in the New South Wales Industrial Commission  in Court Session  which would support an argument that  the making of representations known to be acted upon by a person in considering entry into a contractual relationship and on the basis of which representations an agent as the representor intends the person to act may well  quite apart from any other connection with the contract subsequently made  be itself an arrangement whereby work is performed in an industry  or  at the least  a collateral arrangement to such a contract or arrangement  Ace Business Brokers Pty Ltd v Phillips Treby     IR   at      Contrary to the submission of the BoQ parties  it is thus not impossible for a representation to constitute an  arrangement   Further  if it is one  as the amended summons apparently alleges  and the submissions of the BoQ parties seem to ignore  whereby a person performs work in an industry  that arrangement  if unfair  may  all other things being equal  be the subject of relief under s   of the NSW Act  The Independent Contractors Act may or may not intrude on the ability to grant that relief  but that is not a matter for summary resolution   For these reasons  I do not think there is any utility in adjourning these motions to await the outcome of the Bank s Federal Court proceeding  It would be a total injustice to the OMB parties  at its present rate of progress  it could take years  For the same reasons  it is more appropriate  there can be no argument that the Rossmick Federal Court proceeding and the Jude Federal Court proceeding are respectively related  in the relevant statutory sense  to the Rossmick IC proceeding and the Jude IC proceeding  that these proceedings be determined by the Supreme Court  the same court will then hear all four proceedings   On this basis alone  I am of the view that these proceedings should be transferred to the Supreme Court referred toBishop v Bridgelands Securities Pty Ltd     FCR   The Bank parties submitted that in considering whether the proceedings would be consolidated or heard together  similar issues arise under Rule     of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules    NSW  as would arise on an application for joinder in reliance on O   r  b  of the Federal Court Rules   Matters relevant to the exercise of the discretion in respect of the latter rule were considered by Wilcox J in Bishop v Bridgelands Securities     FCR    Of particular relevance to this application is the passage at     where his Honour said   Similarly  although all applicants might propose to rely upon some common  or similar facts  there may be such differences between the evidence intended to be relied upon in support of the claims of particular applicants as to make it inexpedient to join the claims  The discrete material may overbear that which is common to all the claims  Again  there may be cases in which the sheer number of the claims  if joinder is permitted  will impose an undue burden on the respondent  although it seems to me unlikely that this will be so except in cases where separate evidence is proposed to be adduced in support of individual claims   It is inherent in the OMB parties  submissions that they propose to lead evidence from the OMB parties  the Traderight applicants and  it seems  others which will fall into the category of evidence governed by s   of the Evidence Act    Cth    That is  it appears to be the OMB parties  intention to call evidence from one person that representation X was made to that person for the purpose of persuading the Court that it is more likely that the same representation was also made to one or other of the various applicants   The Bank parties drew the Court s attention to a selected passage in Bishop   FCR  where Wilcox J considered matters relevant to the exercise of the Court s discretion  This case was decided by reference to O   r   of the Federal Court Rules so it cannot be relied upon as authoritative on how the Supreme Court is likely to make future case management decisions with respect to these matters under r     of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules    In any event  the case assists the OMB parties cross vesting motion  as the following excerpt at   indicate   As the discretion conferred by sub rule  b  is  in terms  unconfined  it would be inappropriate to specify circumstances in which it might be applied  Everything must depend upon the facts of the particular case  But it is appropriate to consider what principles ought to guide the exercise of such a discretion  The basic principle  as it seems to me  is that the Court should take whatever course seems to be the most conducive to a just resolution of the disputes between the parties  but having regard to the desirability of limiting  so far as practicable  the costs and delay of the litigation  Considerations of costs and delay may often support the grant of leave under sub rule  b  but  in my opinion  leave ought not to be granted unless the Court is affirmatively satisfied that joinder is unlikely to result in unfairness to any party  Secondly  regard must be had to practical matters  For example  if would normally be inappropriate to grant leave for the joinder of applicants who were represented by different solicitors  There must be a single solicitor  or firm of solicitors  who is accountable for the conduct of the proceeding on the applicants  side of the case   It is clear that the OMB parties in the proceedings before this Court and the plaintiffs in the Traderight proceedings are all represented by McCabe Terrill Lawyers citedJacara Pty Ltd v Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  There is no attempt in the OMB parties  material to identify with precision the evidence which falls into this category  There are merely general assertions  For evidence to be admissible under s  l  of the Evidence Act   it must have significant probative value  In determining whether evidence has significant probative value  the Court would take into account the differences in the representations alleged to have been made as well as the timing of the representations  cf  Jacara Pty Ltd v Perpetual Trustees WA Ltd   FCA         FCR   at       To the extent that an assumption can be made that the evidence of various of the OMB parties will reflect the allegations in their statements of claim  then it is apparent that there are substantial differences with respect to representations said to have been made to the OMB parties in the respective proceedings   From the Traderight statement of claim  it is apparent that the Traderight proceedings concern events occurring between   January   and   August    There are   meetings pleaded and in   of them  representations are said to have been made  Those claimed to have made representations are Mr Allsop  Ms Quinn  an unnamed branch manager

edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  On   April   Spender J granted leave to the OMB parties to appeal against Greenwood J s judgment  The Full Court that heard this appeal rightly construed it as being restricted to challenging the orders of the primary judge made on the strike out application  indeed  it was common ground that no appeal could be brought against an order dismissing an application to cross vest proceedings to another court under the Cross vesting Act  s   of that Act  On   May   the appeal was allowed in part  a number of paragraphs of the defence of the OMB parties were struck out with the OMB parties being granted leave to re plead generally  Rossmick No    Pty Ltd v Bank of Queensland Limited   FCAFC     On   June   Greenwood J set the Bank s Federal Court proceeding down for hearing on   October    On   July   the OMB parties filed and served an amended defence and on   July   the Bank parties filed a motion seeking to strike out a number of paragraphs of the amended defence  This motion was heard by Logan J on   and   July   when his Honour reserved   This was the state of play in the Bank s Federal Court proceeding when the transfer motions in the Rossmick
