appellant only identified  in support of an inference of apprehended bias  the second s  A letter and the Tribunal s ultimate findings  at    His Honour observed that absent a response by the appellant to that letter  there was nothing upon which to base a conclusion that the Tribunal s mind was closed  His Honour commented further that it was unsurprising that  in the absence of a response from the appellant  the matters raised in the second s  A letter ultimately formed at least part of the reasons why the Tribunal affirmed the delegate s decision and the two coincided  His Honour also noted that the fact that the second s  A letter disclosed a predisposition on the part of the Tribunal is not indicative of a closed mind  at   citing Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs v Jia   HCA         CLR   at       per Gleeson CJ and Gummow J  appliedSZEPZ v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs     FCR   As to the alleged breach of s  A of the Act  the information with regard to letters from members of the Awami League was contained in advice received from the Australian High Commission in Dhaka  That information was put to the appellant for comment in the first s  A letter sent by the first Tribunal  It was not contained in the second s  A letter  However  as Cameron FM pointed out  the s  A information was sent by the Tribunal to the appellant  at    The fact that the first s  A letter was sent by the first Tribunal and not the reconstituted Tribunal  does not make it any less a letter pursuant to s  A  of the Act for the purposes of the second hearing  at    Federal Magistrate Cameron referred in this respect to SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs     FCR     In his notice of appeal setting forth the grounds of appeal from the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court the appellant raises  in effect  the same grounds as those raised before his Honour   The first ground asserts error on the part of the Federal Magistrate and failure to provide relief because it is said the reconstituted Tribunal cannot rely on the first s  A letter  sent by the first Tribunal   The second ground alleges that there was a reasonable apprehension that the Tribunal member had made up his mind to affirm the decision of the delegate at the time when the reconstituted Tribunal sought to comply with its obligations under s  A of the Act  The particulars given of that ground set forth the tests to be applied in the determination of apprehended bias and an assertion that the Tribunal member had already decided to affirm the decision of the delegate at the time that the letter was sent   As to the first ground  I do not see any error in the reasoning of the Federal Magistrate or his Honour s reliance on SZEPZ   The information that formed part of the reason for decision of the reconstituted Tribunal  which it was obliged to provide to the appellant for comment  was the information as to false documents that was contained in the first s  A letter  As such  it was available to the reconstituted Tribunal to rely upon it without further requirement that it be sent to the appellant again  Although it is for the member of the reconstituted Tribunal to provide the consideration of what would be the reason or part of the reason for affirming a decision under review  the sending of information for the purposes of s  A  of the Act and the receipt of information for the purposes of s  A b  does not depend on the identity of the particular member constituting the Tribunal   SZEPZ at       I also agree with his Honour s reasons for rejecting the claim of apprehended bias  No basis to support this ground has been made out  The appellant appeared before me in person assisted by an interpreter  When asked to expand upon this ground  he asserted that the Tribunal had made its decision in bad faith but was unable to provide particulars other than his wish to have the decision set aside so that he could put more information  being further material that was not before the Tribunal at the time of his decision  to the Tribunal in order to enable it to come  he said  to a different conclusion   I have not discerned jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal nor error on the part of the Federal Magistrate   It follows that the appeal must be dismissed  The appellant is to pay the first respondent s costs   I certify that the preceding twelve   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice

Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FMCA    The appellant claimed that      the Tribunal had already made up its mind to affirm the delegate s decision by the time it sent the second s  A letter
