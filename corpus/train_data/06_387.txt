to further amend pleadings  after examination of the first and second respondents in relation to the description of persons concerned with the printing production and publication of the newspaper know as the  C atalyst             The applicant  who is self represented  in the principal proceedings  seeks various claims for relief  for damages and declarations  He applies to the Court for damages for defamation pursuant to the Defamation Act    Qld  for breach of s  of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  a compensation order pursuant to s H of the Corporations Act    Cth  for breach of the civil penalty provisions s      and   pursuant to the Corporations Law   for conspiracy to injure at common law  together with various ancillary declarations and orders      The applicant alleges    That between   August   and   September    and in the proposed Amended Statement of Claim   which I will return to later  from   August   to   November   the     respondents    did agree and conspire with each other and other persons unknown to the applicant to injure to the applicant by unlawful means and to commit offences against the laws of the Commonwealth and the state of Queensland and to wit to defame and injure the applicant in the conduct of his business  So to conspire would constitute an offences under s D of the Crimes Act   pursuant to s    of the Criminal Code    Cth  s b d f  of the Criminal Code Act    Qld   Cth  for which  if convicted the said respondents  would be liable to be imprisoned      Similar allegations were repeated in the next paragraph  concluding  and to wit defraud the applicant and injure his economic well being ss     B d  and    e  of the Trade Practices Act     for which  if convicted the said respondents  would be liable to be imprisoned         The applicant claims that at all material times he conducted himself in the business as a public accountant under his own name at Burleigh Heads in Queensland     The Statement of Claim continues that between the same dates  and at the same places  the same parties did proceed to implement those arrangements or understandings by writing  printing and causing to be published a document titled  The Catalyst  Volume   Issue    The Statement of Claim refers to a story on the front page of that publication  which had the headline  Sharples Money Trail Leads to Senior Liberal        The story asserted that there was an agreement by Tony Abbott  a Minister in the Federal Government  to fund an action which the applicant took in the Supreme Court of Queensland  relating to the validity of the registration of One Nation as a political party in Queensland  and further asserted that the applicant wrote to Mr Abbott  which letter  amongst other things  said  Attached is a list of moneys I have expended on the cause and your personal cheque by return mail is requested in satisfaction thereof       The article further said  This astounding hard evidence shows to what extent Abbott and the Liberal Party will go to force One Nation and Pauline Hanson out of politics  They have a lot to lose       The applicant alleges he  has been injured in his personal and professional reputation and otherwise dammed    He  has suffered economic loss   alleging a minimum of   and  special damages   alleging a minimum of        It is necessary to consider the jurisdiction of this Court in a claim for defamation  brought under the Defamation Act    Qld      The Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  s   provides    Jurisdiction in associated matters       To the extent that the Constitution permits  jurisdiction is conferred on the Court in respect of matters not otherwise within its jurisdiction that are associated with matters in which the jurisdiction of the Court is invoked      The jurisdiction conferred by subsection   extends to jurisdiction to hear and determine an appeal from a judgment of a court so far as it relates to a matter that is associated with a matter in respect of which an appeal from that judgment  or another judgment of that court  is brought           Under s     this Court is empowered to determine the applicant s claim in defamation  if it is associated with a matter or matters that fall within the Court s jurisdiction  The question is whether the claim in defamation is  associated  with the federal claims     In Fencott v Muller   HCA         CLR   at       the majority  Mason  Murphy  Brennan and Deane JJ  said   On the other hand  particular legal proceedings may relate to part only of what should properly be seen as the one larger  matter       The concept of  matter  as a justiciable controversy  identifiable independently of the proceedings which are brought for its determination and encompassing all claims made within the scope of the controversy  was accepted by a majority of the court in  Philip Morris v Brown   HCA         CLR   Barwick CJ said  at    It is settled doctrine in Australia that when a court which can exercise federal jurisdiction has its jurisdiction attracted in relation to a matter  that jurisdiction extends to the resolution of the whole matter  This accrued federal jurisdiction is not limited to matters incidental to that aspect of the matter which has  in the first place  attracted federal jurisdiction  It extends  in my opinion  to the resolution of the whole matter between the parties  This accrued jurisdiction carries with it the authority to make such remedial orders as are necessary or convenient for or in consequence of that resolution  For this purpose  the court exercising federal jurisdiction may enforce rights which derive from a non federal source  This exercise of this jurisdiction  which for want of a better term I shall call  accrued  jurisdiction  is discretionary and not mandatory  though it will be obligatory to exercise the federal jurisdiction which has been attracted in relation to the matter         The majority continue   CLR   at        However  federal judicial power is attracted to the whole of a controversy only if the federal claim is a substantial aspect of that controversy  A federal claim which is a trivial or insubstantial aspect of the controversy must  of course  itself be resolved in federal jurisdiction  but it would be neither appropriate nor convenient in such a case to translate to federal jurisdiction the determination of the substantial aspects of the controversy from the jurisdiction to which they are subject in order to determine the trivial or insubstantial federal aspect  Again  impression and practical judgment must determine whether it is appropriate and convenient that the whole controversy be determined by the exercise of federal judicial power        In Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally and Another   HCA         CLR   the High Court determined that the Federal Court is not competent to hear matters which are solely State matters  In my judgment  the constitutional  matter  of the applicant s claim is the alleged agreement or conspiracy to publish the article in   The Catalyst  which is set out in the Statement of Claim  This matter is not  in my view  one of which it can clearly be said to involve no federal aspect  I will therefore consider whether it is just to extend time to bring proceedings  notwithstanding the periods of limitation have expired     The applicant claims against all of the respondents   Damages including aggravated and exemplary damages  together with interest pursuant to the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  and costs for         a  breach of section   when read with s     of the Trade Practices Act    Cth     b  defamation pursuant to the Defamation Act    Qld     c  criminal conspiracy to injure defame and defraud the applicant in his professional business     d  breaches of for contravention of civil penalty provisions ss   and   as defined by s  DA of the Corporations Law      e  compensation order pursuant to section  H of the Corporations Act              During the hearing of this Motion  the applicant admitted that the essence of his claim was defamation  When asked by the Court    Are  the declarations sought  not simply dependent on your making good your claims in respect of defamation and other breaches of the trade practices and corporations laws    the applicant stated   They don t stand apart from it  except perhaps the order for declaration  but I suppose that s tied to the defamation action in any case     emphasis added    Further  in his affidavit dated   November   the applicant said     I was legally advised  in early March   that the evidence of Mr  Ettridge was insufficient to found a claim for damages for defamation     emphasis added      It is clear that a  matter  may properly found a claim based on s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and a claim for defamation  The Federal Court  per Bowen CJ  Lockhart and Fitzgerald JJ in Global Sportsman Pty Ltd   anor v Mirror Newspapers Ltd   anor     Global Sportman      ALR   said at    There is no definable boundary between conduct which is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive and material which is defamatory  Material which is defamatory does not fall outside the operation of sub s   of the Act merely for that reasons any more than it is brought within the operation of sub s   by reason only that it is defamatory  If the operation of sub s   was limited to exclude material because it was defamatory  not only newspaper publishers  but all corporations would be exonerated  Such a proposition would severely restrict the broad generality of s             I referred to Global Sportsman in Lloyd s Ships v Davros     ALR   and noted  at       if a statement for which a corporation is responsible is made in trade or commerce and  if the statement contains or conveys a misrepresentation  the making of it will constitute conduct which is misleading or deceptive or likely to misled of deceive  The fact that the material is defamatory does not for that reason fall outside the operation of s   nor is it brought within the operation of s   because it is defamatory         Counsel for the respondents  Mr Tim Matthews  argued that in commencing proceedings on   October   the applicant was out of time in relation to the claim for damages based on the  alleged  defamation  It was further submitted that the claims for breaches of the Trade Practices Act and Corporations Act are also out of time     In the case of the tort of defamation  time starts to run at the date of publication  The Limitation of Actions Act    Qld  s  a  provides    Actions of contract and tort and certain other actions     The following actions shall not be brought after the expiration of   years from the date on which the cause of action arose      a  subject to section  AA   an action founded on simple contract or quasi contract or on tort where the damages claimed by the plaintiff do not consist of or include damages in respect of personal injury to any person        The original Statement of Claim was filed on   October    The impugned conduct there is said to have occurred between   August   and   September       Atkinson J gave Reasons for Judgment  in proceedings in the Supreme Court of Queensland on August     the effect of which led to the deregistration of Pauline Hansons  One Nation

party have leave to amend any document in the proceeding  in either case in such manner as the Court thinks fit          All necessary amendments shall be made for the purpose of determining the real questions raised by or otherwise depending on the proceeding  or of correcting any defence or error in any proceeding  or of avoiding multiplicity of proceedings        Where an application to the Court for leave to make the amendment mentioned in sub rules     or   or paragraph  a  is made after the relevant period of limitation current at the date of the commencement of the proceeding has expired  the Court may  nevertheless  grant such leave in the circumstances mentioned in that sub rule if it thinks it is just to do so        Federal Court Rules   O   r   allows for the amendment of pleading without leave    A party may  without leave  amend any pleading of his once at any time before the pleadings are closed           Federal Court Rules   O   r   provides    Subrule   does not permit an amendment that would have an effect inconsistent with any statute that limits the time within which an action or proceeding of a particular kind may be brought or instituted        Federal Court Rules   O   r   provides for the disallowance of amendment    If a party amends a pleading under sub rule     the Court may  subject to sub rule   by order disallow the amendment           In the present circumstances  O   r   confers a discretion on the Court to extend the time within which to bring proceedings  from   September   to   October    if it thinks it is just to do so       The issue for the Court is whether the applicant should be permitted to rely on his new and extended allegation  yet to be pleaded  that  between   August and   November   certain things happened  The applicant has provided no evidence explaining why this change in the period was introduced into the Statement of Claim     On   November   the Court gave the applicant leave to amend the Statement of Claim  Those Orders were as follows         Leave is granted to the applicant to amend the principal proceedings to remove  Gympie Times Pty Ltd ACN       as fifth respondent in those proceedings

aspect of the controversy must  of course  itself be resolved in federal jurisdiction  but it would be neither appropriate nor convenient in such a case to translate to federal jurisdiction the determination of the substantial aspects of the controversy from the jurisdiction to which they are subject in order to determine the trivial or insubstantial federal aspect  Again  impression and practical judgment must determine whether it is appropriate and convenient that the whole controversy be determined by the exercise of federal judicial power        In Re Wakim  Ex parte McNally and Another   HCA         CLR   the High Court determined that the Federal Court is not competent to hear matters which are solely State matters  In my judgment  the constitutional  matter  of the applicant s claim is the alleged agreement or conspiracy to publish the article in   The Catalyst  which is set out in the Statement of Claim  This matter is not  in my view  one of which it can clearly be said to involve no federal aspect  I will therefore consider whether it is just to extend time to bring proceedings  notwithstanding the periods of limitation have expired     The applicant

of the Corporations Act              During the hearing of this Motion  the applicant admitted that the essence of his claim was defamation  When asked by the Court    Are  the declarations sought  not simply dependent on your making good your claims in respect of defamation and other breaches of the trade practices and corporations laws    the applicant stated   They don t stand apart from it  except perhaps the order for declaration  but I suppose that s tied to the defamation action in any case     emphasis added    Further  in his affidavit dated   November   the applicant said     I was legally advised  in early March   that the evidence of Mr  Ettridge was insufficient to found a claim for damages for defamation     emphasis added      It is clear that a  matter  may properly found a claim based on s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  and a claim for defamation  The Federal Court  per Bowen CJ  Lockhart and Fitzgerald JJ in Global Sportsman Pty Ltd   anor v Mirror Newspapers Ltd   anor     Global Sportman      ALR   said at    There is no definable boundary between conduct which is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive and material which is defamatory  Material which is defamatory does not fall outside the operation of sub s   of the Act merely for that reasons any more than it is brought within the operation of sub s   by reason only that it is defamatory  If the operation of sub s   was limited to exclude material because it was defamatory  not only newspaper publishers  but all corporations would be exonerated  Such a proposition would severely restrict the broad generality of s             I referred to Global Sportsman in Lloyd s Ships v Davros     ALR   and noted  at       if a statement for which a corporation is responsible is made in trade or commerce and  if the statement contains or conveys a misrepresentation  the making of it will constitute conduct which is misleading or deceptive or likely to misled of deceive  The fact that the material is defamatory does not for that reason fall outside the operation of s   nor is it brought within the operation of s   because it is defamatory         Counsel for the respondents  Mr Tim Matthews  argued that in commencing proceedings on   October   the applicant was out of time in relation to the claim for damages based on the  alleged  defamation  It was further submitted that the claims for breaches of the Trade Practices Act and Corporations Act are also out of time     In the case of the tort of defamation  time starts to run at the date of publication

or include damages in respect of personal injury to any person        The original Statement of Claim was filed on   October    The impugned conduct there is said to have occurred between   August   and   September       Atkinson J gave Reasons for Judgment  in proceedings in the Supreme Court of Queensland on August     the effect of which led to the deregistration of Pauline Hansons  One Nation

questions raised by or otherwise depending on the proceeding  or of correcting any defence or error in any proceeding  or of avoiding multiplicity of proceedings        Where an application to the

the present circumstances  O   r   confers a discretion on the Court to extend the time within which to bring proceedings  from   September   to   October    if it thinks it is just to do so       The issue for the Court is whether the applicant should be permitted to rely on his new and extended allegation  yet to be pleaded  that  between   August and   November   certain things happened  The applicant has provided no evidence explaining why this change in the period was introduced into the Statement of Claim     On   November   the Court gave the applicant leave to amend the Statement of Claim  Those Orders were as follows         Leave is granted to the applicant to amend the principal proceedings to remove  Gympie Times Pty Ltd ACN       as fifth respondent in those proceedings         Leave is granted to the applicant to amend the name of the fourth respondent in the principal proceedings to read  Ross Bensted  rather than  Ross Binstead  consideredLloyd s Ships v Davros     ALR    That leave be granted to further amend pleadings  after examination of the first and second respondents in relation to the description of persons concerned with the printing production and publication of the newspaper know as the  C atalyst             The applicant  who is self represented  in the principal proceedings  seeks various claims for relief  for damages and declarations  He applies to the Court for damages for defamation pursuant to the Defamation Act    Qld  for breach of s  of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  a compensation order pursuant to s H of the Corporations Act    Cth  for breach of the civil penalty provisions s      and   pursuant to the Corporations Law   for conspiracy to injure at common law  together with various ancillary declarations and orders      The applicant alleges    That between   August   and   September    and in the proposed Amended Statement of Claim   which I will return to later  from   August   to   November   the     respondents    did agree and conspire with each other and other persons unknown to the applicant to injure to the applicant by unlawful means and to commit offences against the laws of the Commonwealth and the state of Queensland and to wit to defame and injure the applicant in the conduct of his business  So to conspire would constitute an offences under s D of the Crimes Act   pursuant to s    of the Criminal Code    Cth  s b d f  of the Criminal Code Act    Qld   Cth  for which  if convicted the said respondents  would be liable to be imprisoned      Similar allegations were repeated in the next paragraph  concluding  and to wit defraud the applicant and injure his economic well being ss     B d  and    e  of the Trade Practices Act     for which  if convicted the said respondents  would be liable to be imprisoned         The applicant claims that at all material times he conducted himself in the business as a public accountant under his own name at Burleigh Heads in Queensland     The Statement of Claim continues that between the same dates  and at the same places  the same parties did proceed to implement those arrangements or understandings by writing  printing and causing to be published a document titled  The Catalyst  Volume   Issue    The Statement of Claim refers to a story on the front page of that publication  which had the headline  Sharples Money Trail Leads to Senior Liberal        The story asserted that there was an agreement by Tony Abbott  a Minister in the Federal Government  to fund an action which the applicant took in the Supreme Court of Queensland  relating to the validity of the registration of One Nation as a political party in Queensland  and further asserted that the applicant wrote to Mr Abbott  which letter  amongst other things  said  Attached is a list of moneys I have expended on the cause and your personal cheque by return mail is requested in satisfaction thereof       The article further said  This astounding hard evidence shows to what extent Abbott and the Liberal Party will go to force One Nation and Pauline Hanson out of politics  They have a lot to lose       The applicant alleges he  has been injured in his personal and professional reputation and otherwise dammed    He  has suffered economic loss   alleging a minimum of   and  special damages   alleging a minimum of        It is necessary to consider the jurisdiction of this Court in a claim for defamation  brought under the Defamation Act    Qld      The Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  s   provides    Jurisdiction in associated matters       To the extent that the Constitution permits  jurisdiction is conferred on the Court in respect of matters not otherwise within its jurisdiction that are associated with matters in which the jurisdiction of the Court is invoked      The jurisdiction conferred by subsection   extends to jurisdiction to hear and determine an appeal from a judgment of a court so far as it relates to a matter that is associated with a matter in respect of which an appeal from that judgment  or another judgment of that court  is brought           Under s     this Court is empowered to determine the applicant s claim in defamation  if it is associated with a matter or matters that fall within the Court s jurisdiction  The question is whether the claim in defamation is  associated  with the federal claims     In Fencott v Muller   HCA         CLR   at       the majority  Mason  Murphy  Brennan and Deane JJ  said   On the other hand  particular legal proceedings may relate to part only of what should properly be seen as the one larger  matter       The concept of  matter  as a justiciable controversy  identifiable independently of the proceedings which are brought for its determination and encompassing all claims made within the scope of the controversy  was accepted by a majority of the court in  Philip Morris v Brown   HCA         CLR   Barwick CJ said  at    It is settled doctrine in Australia that when a court which can exercise federal jurisdiction has its jurisdiction attracted in relation to a matter  that jurisdiction extends to the resolution of the whole matter  This accrued federal jurisdiction is not limited to matters incidental to that aspect of the matter which has  in the first place  attracted federal jurisdiction  It extends  in my opinion  to the resolution of the whole matter between the parties  This accrued jurisdiction carries with it the authority to make such remedial orders as are necessary or convenient for or in consequence of that resolution  For this purpose  the court exercising federal jurisdiction may enforce rights which derive from a non federal source  This exercise of this jurisdiction  which for want of a better term I shall call  accrued  jurisdiction  is discretionary and not mandatory  though it will be obligatory to exercise the federal jurisdiction which has been attracted in relation to the matter         The majority continue   CLR   at        However  federal judicial power is attracted to the whole of a controversy only if the federal claim is a substantial aspect of that controversy  A federal claim which is a trivial or insubstantial aspect of the controversy must  of course  itself be resolved in federal jurisdiction  but it would be neither appropriate nor convenient in such a case to

than  Ross Binstead  appliedWarramunda Village Inc v Pryde   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html   Any material in response to the applicant s material in support of his motion for an extension of time should be filed and served by   pm on Friday   December         These comprehensive directions appear to have been misconstrued by the applicant  An Amended Statement of Claim was filed by the applicant on   December    This document goes well beyond what the applicant had  foreshadowed       The Amended Statement of Claim has changed the pleading of the date of publication  from  between   August and   September   to  between   August   and   November    The effect of this change is to plead a cause action for which the limitation period has expired  Secondly  in his Amended Statement of Claim  the applicant has added a respondent  being Catalyst Newspapers Proprietary Limited     There was nothing in the grant of leave that gave the applicant the ability to add a party or to amend the substance of the claim  as the applicant has done  In particular  it is not competent  without leave  to amend a pleading if the effect of the amendment was to plead a cause of action in respect of which the relevant period of limitation had expired     Because Mr Sharples is acting for himself  I think the better course is to consider his notice of motion to be an application for an extension of time in which to bring his proposed causes of action  the relevant periods of limitation having expired     In an affidavit filed   November   the applicant provides various reasons for his failure to lodge his claim within time  He says that although he became aware of the publication in late   he received legal advice in March   that he had insufficient evidence to found a claim in damages  He further asserts that  despite his best endeavours  he could not receive a copy of the article to enable him to pursue his action until searching the Queensland State Archives in September    He contends the newspaper was not available by normal means  being posted out to supporters and members of the party     In his affidavit  the applicant also contends     I verily believe no prejudice will be occasioned by the respondents by an order extending time  should such an order  as a matter of law  be required to found these proceedings       I verily believe there is an addition to my own interests in this litigation a public interest in bring to account people who wrongfully misuse and abuse the constitutional freedom of speech in this country  for personal advantage         One difficulty the applicant faces is his claim that he first obtained a copy of the newspaper article in late September    Only at this time  the applicant claims  did he have sufficient evidence to institute legal proceedings against the various respondents  However  the applicant seeks to show a republication of the article  He points to an affidavit of Mr Ettridge  who swears that   sometime  in December   he received a copy of the Catalyst newspaper by post  Of course  this is after   November   the end point of the period for which he contends in the Amended Statement of Claim filed   December       The applicant contends that publication occurs   not just when the newspaper is printed  It s when it is when people read it  Every time people read something like that  it s re published  And that s the time frame that should be applied here   He further stated   the person is defamed every time someone reads it       The only evidence before the Court of publication  or re publication of the article  is to Mr Ettridge   sometime   in December    This is the date that the applicant contends the limitation period should commence  this is the date the applicant seeks to have as the   publication point       The applicant contends that his ignorance of the publication should be no bar against his claim  that he did not have any reasonable way of knowing about the alleged defamation until it was told to him verbally  and he could thus make proper inquiry and obtain a copy of the newspaper     The applicant s reasoning poses problems  If the applicant s contentions are correct  and it is  just  to extend time to bring an action to the time a party learns that he has suffered damage  then there would effectively be no limitation period in respect of defamation  Unfortunately for the applicant  except for exceptions of fraudulent concealment and the like  limitation periods do not start to run from the period a person learns they have suffered damage     In the original Statement of Claim the conduct on which of the respondents on which he complains is said to have taken place between   August   and   September    The applicant s proceedings were not commenced until   October   which is after the affluxion of the period of limitation of six years  Even with the changes introduced by the Amended Statement of Claim filed on   December   which extended the period so that the relevant period was   August   to   November   the causes were then out of time     The right to bring actions under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  at the time was within the period of three years  The period of limitation by subsequent amendments to the Trade Practices Act has now been extended to six years  but those amendments were not retrospective  The applicant on any view of the relevant time period is out of time and statute barred in respect to breaches of the Trade Practices Act    Cth      In respect of claims based on the Corporations Law    Cth  or compensation pursuant to the Corporations Act    Cth  the relevant limitation periods again were no more than three years     Viewing the matter more generally  the present application by the applicant  is one made in early   for an extension of time to bring proceedings in respect of conduct that occurred at the latest by the end of December    Nothing in the material before the Court provides a basis for concluding that it would be just for the period within which to bring proceedings to be extended this time      The claims for damages  with their various statutory foundations are statute barred and those claims should be struck out  see Kim v Minister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and the Commonwealth of Australia   FCA         As to the applicant s claims for declarations  s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  provides    Declarations of right         The Court may  in relation to a matter in which it has original jurisdiction  make binding declarations of right  whether or not any consequential relief is or could be claimed      A suit is not open to objection on the ground that a declaratory order only is sought               The purpose of declarations were discussed by this Court in Warramunda Village Inc v Pryde   FCA     where the Court  discussing the power in s     said at par       The remedy of a declaration of right is ordinarily granted as final relief in a proceeding  It is intended to state the rights of the parties with respect to a particular matter with precision  and in a binding way  The remedy of a declaration is not an appropriate way of recording in a summary form  conclusions reached by the Court in reasons for judgment  This is even more strongly the case when the conclusion is not one from which any right or liability necessarily flows         In the light of my conclusions about the various claims for damages  the present case is not one in which there would be any basis for the making of the declarations sought     For the above reasons the Notice of Motion by the applicant seeking that the  Time for issuing of these proceedings be extended if required by law until           October   be dismissed and that the relief claimed in par   of the applicant s Notice of Motion filed   November   namely   That leave be granted for further amended pleadings after the examination of the First and Second Respondents in relation to the description of persons concerned with the printing  production and publication of the newspaper known as the catalyst  be refused     On the Notice of Motion by the First and Second Respondents  the Court orders that the applicant s application and statement of claim be struck out  as statute barred     The
