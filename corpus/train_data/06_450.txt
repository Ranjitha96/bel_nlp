Traxon Industries Pty Ltd ACN       v Emerson Electric Co   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedDelco Australia Pty Ltd v Equipment Enterprises Incorporated trading as Kukla Trenchers   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The causes of action pleaded are based on conduct engaged in in the United States  Even though the duties pleaded depend upon conduct in Australia that does not mean that their breach by acts outside Australia gives rise to a cause of action  arising in the Commonwealth  under O   r  a   As von Doussa J observed in Delco Australia Pty Ltd v Equipment Enterprises Incorporated trading as Kukla Trenchers   FCA     the authorities establish that  cause of action  within the meaning of O   r  a  does not refer to all the elements of the cause of action  It refers rather to the act on the part of the defendant which gave the plaintiff his cause for complaint  In Distillers Co  Biochemicals  v Thompson   AC   at   Lord Pearson said  at     It is not the right approach to say that  because there was no complete tort until the damage occurred  therefore the cause of action arose wherever the damage happened to occur  The right approach is  when the tort is complete  to look back over the series of events constituting it and ask the question  where in substance did this cause of action arise      Theory no  iii  is that the cause of action arose within the jurisdiction if the act on the part of the defendant  which gives the plaintiff his cause of complaint has occurred within the jurisdiction  That is the rule laid down in Jackson v Spittal   LR  CP   which is an authoritative case  and the rule is inherently reasonable  as the defendant is called upon to answer for his wrong in the courts of the country where he did the wrong      In my opinion the causes of action in breach of confidence and breach of fiduciary duty are not demonstrated  on the current state of the pleadings  to be proceedings to which O   r   applies   The question that then arises is whether  given that the causes of action in misleading or deceptive conduct and breach of contract are within O   r   that is sufficient to satisfy the requirement that the rule  applies to the proceeding  within the meaning of O   r  b   As to that von Doussa J in Delco Australia said  at      In this Court r  n  makes express provision for a proceeding where a proceeding does not fall squarely within one of the heads enumerated in the earlier paragraphs  In my opinion r  n  makes it clear that an originating process to be served out of the Commonwealth must be confined to causes of action that fall wholly within one or several of the heads in r    An originating process that includes a claim that does not fall within one or more of the heads is not an originating process that meets the description of r   in that it is not one  in  any of the cases described in the rule  It is not a  proceeding to which rule   applies  so as to meet the requirement of r  c b   A similar conclusion was expressed by Wilcox J in Tycoon Holdings Ltd v Tencor Jetco Inc     FCR   at     In the circumstances  because of the inclusion of the claims for breach of confidence and breach of fiduciary duty  it is not possible to conclude that  the proceeding  is one to which O   r   applies  The order sought by Traxon cannot be made on the current state of the pleadings  It will be necessary to reconsider the pleadings and either plead those facts which would make it clear that the causes of action referred to fall within the scope of the rule or to abandon those causes of action citedDistillers Co  Biochemicals  v Thompson   AC   The causes of action pleaded are based on conduct engaged in in the United States  Even

relief sought  was expounded in Sydbank Soenderjylland A S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd     FCR   at    The Court quoted with approval a passage from the judgment of Heerey J in Merpro Montassa Ltd v Conoco Specialty Products Inc     FCR   at   where his Honour said           the requirement of O   r  c  has to be met at the outset of the proceedingS  It does not suggest the kind of scrutiny that would occur in a submission of no case to answer following the closure of an applicant s case at trial    It may be therefore that a court at this stage might draw inferences more readily in favour of an applicant  bearing in mind  among other things  that the applicant will not have had the advantage of discovery  subpoena and other procedural aids to the making out of a prima facie case at trial      As I observed in Western Australia v Vetter Trittler Pty Ltd  In liq      FCR   at          A prima facie case is made out if  on the material before the Court  inferences are open which it translated into findings of fact  would support the relief claimed      The requirement for a prima facie case is satisfied by demonstration of a prime facie case  for the relief sought by the party on the proceeding   Where the relief sought is based upon more than one cause of action  it is sufficient that there is a prima facie case demonstrated for at least one of the causes of action relied upon  In my opinion it is sufficient to say for the moment that a prima facie case within the meaning of O   r  c  is raised in respect of the cause of action in breach of contract  It is questionable whether there is a prima facie case shown for misleading or deceptive conduct without more than the alleged breach of the promises embodied in the agreements  There is a disquieting confusion about the documentation comprising the written part of the so called Distribution and Confidentiality Agreement made in    Having regard  however  to my conclusions that the proceeding is not one to which O
