Victoria  Ex parte State Public Services Federation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Arts Victoria Act    Vic  creates the office of Director  Arts Victoria  and provides for the appointment of a body called the Victorian Council of the Arts  Section   of that Act provides  in relation to the Department of Premier and Cabinet       The objects of the Department under this Act are       a  to develop and improve the knowledge understanding appreciation   and practice of the Arts in Victoria       b  to increase the availability and accessibility of the Arts to the public of   Victoria       c  to encourage and assist in the provision of facilities to enable the Arts   to be performed or displayed       d  to continually survey and assess the position of the Arts in Victoria   and to report to the Parliament at least once in every year on the   condition of the Arts in Victoria and to suggest ways in which the Arts   may be further and better assisted       e  to administer the Acts and enactments for which the Minister is   responsible       f  to advise and co operate with other Departments of the Government   public statutory authorities municipalities and other persons or bodies   concerned with the promotion or practice of the Arts in Victoria   It is clear that the Trust is not a State Government department  for the purposes of the phrase  State Government Departments and Instrumentalities  in the award clauses with which this case is concerned  There is a clear contrast between the Trust and Arts Victoria  which is described as a division of what is undoubtedly a State Government department  The test for determining whether a particular body is an  instrumentality  of a State  within the ordinary meaning of that term  is found in Re Anti Cancer Council of Victoria  Ex parte State Public Services Federation   HCA         CLR   at   where the High Court said       It is well settled that union eligibility rules are to be interpreted liberally and according to their ordinary and popular meaning  However  the expression  State instrumentality  is one that carries much the same meaning in popular usage as in a legal context  That meaning directs attention to the purpose or end served  so that a body is a State instrumentality if it is empowered to and does  in fact  serve some State government purpose  And that is so even if it is neither a servant nor an agent of the State    Footnotes omitted  In the Anti Cancer Council case  the court held that the Anti Cancer Council of Victoria  the ACCV  was not a  State instrumentality  within the meaning of that expression in a trade union s eligibility rules  The ACCV was not under ministerial control  Its only function that might have been described as serving a State Government purpose was the receipt of reports and the keeping and compiling of a register  for which the ACCV received a small amount of government funding  Significantly  there was no obligation imposed on the ACCV with respect to the reports it received or the cancer register  The court held that the ACCV fell within another limb of the rule of the trade union in question  which defined those eligible for membership   Counsel for the respondent attempted to rely on the capitalisation of the initial letter of the word  Instrumentalities  in each of cl  A a ii  of the   Award and cl      b  of the   Award  as well as in the earlier Victorian award  as indicative that a particular meaning of the word had been intended  Capitalisation of the initial letters of words in headings is a common practice  Inappropriate capitalisation of the initial letters of words  when not used in headings  is also common  It is unlikely to indicate the use of a term of art  In any event  if a conscious decision had been made to use the word  Instrumentalities  as a term of art  the option of defining it in the award was available  It is unlikely that whoever drafted the   Award made a conscious decision to use a term of art  and to indicate that a term of art had been used solely by the use of an initial capital letter  I do not accept that the fact that the word  Instrumentality  has a capital initial in the   Award and the earlier Victorian award that replaced it can be said to be indicative of a term of art  This is so  even when the word is contrasted with the word  instrumentality  in the clause considered by the High Court in the Anti Cancer Council case consideredFederated Municipal and Shire Council Employees  Union of Australia v Melbourne Corporation   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Among the authorities cited for the central proposition is the passage in the judgment of Isaacs and Rich JJ in Federated Municipal and Shire Council Employees  Union of Australia v Melbourne Corporation   HCA         CLR   at     where their Honours said       If a municipality either   is legally empowered to perform and does perform any function whatever for the Crown  or   is lawfully empowered to perform and does perform any function which constitutionally is inalienably a Crown function   as  for instance  the administration of justice   the municipality is in law presumed to represent the Crown  and the exemption applies  Otherwise  it is outside that exemption  and  if impliedly exempted at all  some other principle must be resorted to  The making and maintenance of streets in the municipality is not within either proposition  distinguishedR v Industrial Court of South Australia  Ex parte Australian Broadcasting Commission     SASR   Counsel for the respondent relied on R v Industrial Court of South Australia  Ex parte Australian Broadcasting Commission     SASR    The Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia held that the Australian Broadcasting Commission  the ABC  was not an  instrumentality or agency of the Government of the Commonwealth  within the meaning of s   of the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act      SA   At   Bray CJ  with whom Hogarth J agreed  referred to Electricity Trust of South Australia v Linterns Ltd   SASR   in which it was held that the Electricity Trust of South Australia was a government instrumentality  as it managed the undertaking for the supply of electricity and the mining of coal in South Australia  exercised its functions on behalf of the Crown  and was the means or agency for managing a Crown asset  At     Bray CJ conceded that the ABC might be regarded as an instrumentality of the Commonwealth  but expressed the view that it could not be regarded as an instrumentality of the  Government  of the Commonwealth  His Honour took the view that the word  Government  with a capital initial  in s   meant the executive government of the Commonwealth  At   his Honour examined various provisions of the statute creating the ABC  emphasising the degree of autonomy from the executive government enjoyed by the ABC  with ministerial control only over a small number of specified functions  or in some exceptional specified circumstances  and the obligation of the ABC to indemnify the Postmaster General in respect of any claim for anything done by the Postmaster General s Department at the request of the ABC  His Honour also pointed out that there was nothing in the statute declaring that the ABC held its assets on behalf of the Crown  At     Bray CJ also regarded as relevant the question whether the degree of ministerial control was sufficient to entitle the ABC to the shield of the Crown  Assuming it to have been decided correctly  the ABC case is readily distinguishable from the present referred toElectricity Trust of South Australia v Linterns Ltd   SASR   Counsel for the respondent

from the present citedSuperannuation Fund Investment Trust v Commissioner of Stamps  SA    HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In the present case  one of the most striking features of the Trust is the extent to which it is subject to ministerial control  By s   of the VAC Act  the Trust s management of the Victorian Arts Centre is expressly subject to the general direction and control of the relevant Minister of the Crown  The Trust can only perform functions outside those expressly conferred by s   if the Minister approves of such functions  see s h   The exercise of the Trust s borrowing power is only possible with the approval of the Treasurer  under s    The extent of ministerial control is such that the Trust would be very likely to have the benefit of the immunity of the Crown from the application of legislation not expressed to bind the Crown  or from being sued or convicted of a criminal offence  In determining whether a statutory authority has such immunity  the extent to which it is subject to ministerial control under its establishing legislation is of great importance  See Superannuation Fund Investment Trust v Commissioner of Stamps  SA    HCA         CLR   at     per Stephen J  and State Bank of New South Wales v Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia   HCA         CLR   at   citedState Bank of New South Wales v

State Bank of New South Wales v Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia   HCA         CLR   at     Another significant indicator that the Trust is established to serve a government purpose is the grant to it  by s  A of the VAC Act of the power to make by laws  The delegation of legislative power suggests that the Trust carries on governmental activity  See State Bank of New South Wales at     The examination of the legislative history  and of the current state of the VAC Act  makes it difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Trust is both empowered to serve  and does serve a State Government purpose  That purpose is the control and management of a significant public asset  which successive governments of Victoria have wished to make available for the economic and cultural enrichment of the citizens of Victoria  The information on the Trust s web site confirms this view  The Trust therefore falls clearly within the ordinary meaning of the phrase  State instrumentality    Counsel for the respondent submitted that the expression  State Government Departments and Instrumentalities  in cl  A a ii  of the   Award and cl      b  of the   Award should not bear its ordinary meaning  His submissions were based on the history of the making of the two awards and the circumstances surrounding them  He also advanced a number of other arguments about the construction of the relevant provisions  including the argument that a purposive construction of them should be adopted citedLiquor  Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union v Prestige Property Services Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Counsel for the respondent also attempted to argue that I should have regard to possible anomalies that might arise from the application of cl  A a ii  of the   Award and cl      b  of the   Award to high rise buildings  occupied by a mix of tenants  only some of which were State Government entities  This argument is completely irrelevant to the present case  There is no suggestion that the Victorian Arts Centre is occupied by any entity other than the Trust  The question of multiple occupancy of buildings and the application of cl  A a ii  of the   Award is dealt with in Liquor  Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union v Prestige Property Services Pty Ltd   FCA     a judgment delivered subsequent to the hearing of the present case   For these reasons  I am persuaded that the word  Instrumentalities  when used in the composite phrase  State Government Departments and Instrumentalities  in cl  A a ii  of the   Award and cl      b  of the   Award is used in its ordinary and natural meaning  When so used  as I have already found  it encompasses the Trust   It follows that the respondent has been in breach of its obligations  imposed by cl  A a ii  of the   Award and cl      b  of the   Award  to pay the allowances required by those clauses to its employees engaged in performing cleaning services at the Victorian Arts Centre followedEMCL Pty Ltd v Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd  No        ALR   I also propose to make an order that the respondent pay to each of the persons it employed at the Victorian Arts Centre the amount agreed to be outstanding  To each amount there should be added interest  pursuant to s  A of the WR Act  In this respect  the applicant s claim is modest  Because of the difficulty of calculation of interest when it is payable on a series of payments that were due over a long period  the applicant has asked for interest only from   June   ie  on the total sum owed to each employee in respect of the two periods claimed  The applicant calculated that interest only up to the date when the case was being heard  It should be calculated to the date of judgment  As to the rate  the applicant sought interest at   per cent per annum  that being the operative rate at   June   pursuant to the Penalty Interest Rate Act    Vic   It is appropriate to choose that rate for the reasons advanced in EMCL Pty Ltd v Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd  No        ALR   at   and Textile  Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Givoni Pty Ltd   FCA   at     The rate of interest was increased to     per cent from   June   and to   per cent from   July   but counsel for the applicant forwent any entitlement to a rate greater than   per cent  The order that I make for payment to each employee will therefore include an amount of interest on the sum owing to that employee at   June   at the rate of   per cent per annum  non compounding  from   June   to the date of judgment followedTextile  Clothing and Footwear Union of
