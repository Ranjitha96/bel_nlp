Wiegand v Comcare Australia   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedHart v Comcare   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  This is the second occasion upon which this matter has been before the Court by way of an appeal under s   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act    Cth  against a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal dismissing a claim for compensation under the provisions of the Safety  Rehabilitation and Compensation Act    Cth   the SRC Act    If the Tribunal in this matter had been able to deal with the applicant s claim on the basis of what was understood to be the true construction of s   of the SRC Act at the time of Mr Wiegand s first appeal to the Tribunal  he would have been awarded the compensation he claimed  As the law is now to be understood in light of the decision of the Full Court in Hart v Comcare   FCAFC     the Tribunal acknowledged it had no option but to dismiss the application to it given its findings   At the hearing of this application before me I permitted Mr Wiegand  with the concurrence of Comcare  to raise a new question of law  That new question impugned two critical findings of the Tribunal on the basis that there was no evidence to support either of them  To anticipate what I have to say  I am not satisfied that the Tribunal erred in the way suggested  In these circumstances  as Mr Wiegand reluctantly conceded  I would be obliged to apply Hart and dismiss the application   Mr Wiegand was employed in the Australian Taxation Office from May   until January    In May of   he made his claim for compensation attaching a medical certificate from a psychiatrist which contained a diagnosis of major depression with the stated date of injury as approximately January    The Tribunal indicated in its reasons that the causes of this condition were a large number of  situations and events  which occurred during Mr Wiegand s employment by the ATO     Whilst his evidence suggests that some particular events had a more significant effect on him than others  I find that the combination of a large number of employment related situations and events  including those to which I have referred in paragraphs   and   above  or Mr Wiegand s perception of them  led to his developing major depression  I further find that he was suffering from this condition  or an aggravation of this condition  as at   January   when he failed to return to work at the ATO  and that this condition was materially contributed to by his employment  Reasons par         I would note in passing that par   refers to eleven  situations and events  and par   to    other situations and events   Only one of these was not employment related   Later in its reasons the Tribunal observed  at par   that a large number of the asserted stressors took place prior to October   that Dr Coyte s opinion Dr Coyte was Mr Wiegand s treating psychiatrist was that they had an increasing and compounding effect  and that the pre October   stressors materially contributed to the subsequent development of Mr Wiegand s depression   Accordingly in light of Hart   it confirmed Mr Wiegand s disentitlement to compensation   In Hart   a claimant for compensation under the SRC Act complained of depression  anxiety and adjustment disorder caused by events associated with three applications for promotion in the Department of Defence  The Tribunal in that matter found that the adjustment disorder was first suffered during the events at the time of  and connected with  the procedures employed in relation to three promotions for which the appellant had applied unsuccessfully  It found that her condition was materially contributed to  a  by the failure to obtain promotions and  b  by the events at the time of  and connected with  the procedures employed in the process leading up to the decisions as to the promotions  While it recognised that any disease suffered as a result of the failure to obtain promotion was excluded by s     disease resulting from the other concurrent cause was not  Accordingly it determined that compensation was payable to the applicant in that case   An appeal to this Court resulted in the appeal being allowed and the decision of the Tribunal being set aside  The primary Judge found that the distinction drawn between the two causes was in the circumstances  spurious   On appeal to the Full Court  the appellant argued that the distinction was a valid one  where there were two operative causes  one being compensable and the other not  given the beneficial purpose of the legislation  the approach taken by the Tribunal in that case ought be adopted  For its part on the appeal Comcare raised by way of Notice of Contention that the findings made by the Tribunal were sufficient to meet the words of the proviso  such that there was no  injury  as defined   The Full Court in a joint judgment agreed with that contention  It said at   that     The task is one of statutory construction  This is a beneficial statute  Nevertheless  comformably with that  it is necessary to construe the words used by the Parliament      The so called proviso in the definition does not exclude causes  It provides that if a disease of injury which would otherwise fall within the definition  any such  is one which answers a description  relevantly here   suffered as a result of     the failure to obtain a promotion  the disease or injury is not an  injury  as defined  The words are satisfied here  There was no debate that the factual findings made by the Tribunal amount to a conclusion that the disease or injury suffered was as a result of the failure to obtain the promotions     In order to succeed  the appellant must assert  as she does  that operative causes are not excluded and that given the provision s purpose some modifier should be read into the words to restrict the effect of the exclusion to circumstances where there were no other employment related causes  We do not agree  The operation of the provision had the evident purpose of removing from the field of compensation a disease  injury or aggravation which was a result of something  We see no evident purpose to remove from the field of compensation a disease  injury or aggravation which was only a result of that thing  The words do not readily admit that construction  The cases on multiple causes in tort or general law do not assist that enquiry     It will in any case be for the Tribunal to examine the facts  assess the reasons for the disease  injury or aggravation and come to conclusions in respect thereof  Whether in any given case  those findings allow a conclusion that the condition was suffered as a result of one or more of the matters referred to in the proviso  may be a factual question  or perhaps a legal question  Here  however  the findings were clear  The failure to obtain the promotions materially contributed to the condition and there is no issue but that the condition was suffered as a result of the failure to obtain the promotion   Subject to what I have to say about Mr Wiegand s no evidence claim  in light of the findings made and the decision in Hart the present application must be dismissed  While I am obviously bound to apply Hart   I consider that it produces a harsh outcome in cases such as the present where a psychiatric condition is the product of the cumulative effect of quite some number of stressors experienced over a long period of time  which stressors happen to include a very small number that fall within the s   exclusion   As I have indicated  Mr Wiegand accepts that unless he can impugn the findings made by the Tribunal in relation to the   promotion and the   compassionate leave  his application must be dismissed because of Hart s case  He challenges both of those findings on the basis that there was no evidence to support them appliedTreloar v The Australian Telecommunications Commission     FCR   Two of the relevant events which were found by the Tribunal to have contributed in a material degree to Mr Wiegand s disease were  i  a failure to be promoted in   and  ii  a failure to obtain compassionate leave in    In arriving at this conclusion the Tribunal appears to have applied unexceptionably the decision of the Full Court in Treloar v The Australian Telecommunications Commission     FCR   at   in determining whether the above two events contributed in  a material degree  to his disease   The Tribunal dealt with such evidence as related to the former of these at     of its reasons  These paragraphs  other than par   refer to evidence which suggested the promotion matter  aggrieved  or had a  significant impact  on  Mr Wiegand  or else reflected conduct of the ATO that concerned him  More significant is the following passage in the oral evidence of Dr Coyte on which the Tribunal relied in par    It is as follows     THE D PRESIDENT  Doctor  I wonder if you would look at the report of the decision of the Federal Court in Mr Wiegand s appeal to the Federal Court  in    Do you have that there  It was part of exhibit   tendered this morning  I think  I wonder if you would go to paragraph   of that report and you will see a series of dot points within paragraph     Yes      I wonder if you would just take a moment to read through those particular dot points    How far would you like me to go with this      I think continue to the end of paragraph     Okay     I didn t realise there were so many pages but if I just ask you a general question perhaps to the end of paragraph   and then paragraph   which is very brief      That     Thank you  Now  you understand from having read that  that that is a summary prepared by the Federal Court Judge of the concerns which Mr Wiegand had about events that had happened in the course of his employment    Yes     And which he thought contributed to his ill health  Paragraph   contains what are described as the major events  but not necessarily all of the events  The question is  in the course of his consultations with you has he mentioned those events to you    I could say  yes  he has  Not in as much detail as some of these     No  Certainly  apart from matters of detail  there is nothing new in there that you haven t heard about before    No  there is nothing new     Did all of those matters appear to be of concern to Mr Wiegand    When he related them to me    Yes    Yes      Do you consider that all of those matters contributed to the onset of his depression  or alternatively  to the aggravation of his depression    Yes  I do    TR      at pp     I should interpolate that the   failure to be promoted and its aftermath was one of the events referred to in par    The Tribunal  in par   went on to conclude       Whilst  as I have already found  there was a combination of many events that caused Mr Wiegand s depressive condition  it appears from the evidence before me that this first failure to be promoted marked the beginning of Mr Wiegand s psychological concerns  I find from the above evidence that this event was one of the causative factors for his developing major depression and that it was not an insignificant factor  This factor was an excluded event within the proviso to the definition of  injury     Mr Wiegand s complaint in relation to the promotion incident centred in large measure on the fact that it was only towards the very end of a protracted hearing in the Tribunal that Hart s case became an issue  it having just been decided by the Full Court   Up until then the case had been run by him on grounds suggested by the earlier decision of von Doussa J which related to the reality of his  perceptions   For this reason little attention was given to the   promotion in the course of the proceedings  He contends that his psychiatrist  Dr Coyte  was reluctant to assign diagnostic significance to individual past events such as the   promotion event  Equally Mr Wiegand sought to explain away the significance of the transcript referred to above by saying that  while Dr Coyte agreed that the factors referred to by von Doussa J  including the failure to be promoted  contributed to the onset of his depression  Dr Coyte did not agree that they contributed in a material degree  Given the decision of the Full Court in Treloar s case on the significance of the word  material  in this context  I do not consider there is any substance in this supposed difference  As the Full Court observed in Treloar at   once a causal connection is established between an employment event and the ailment suffered  it matters not that the contribution be large or small    Given Dr Coyte s evidence  there was some evidentiary basis for the Tribunal making the finding that it did  Whether that finding was in fact erroneous or not is not a matter of present relevance  I have referred above to the threshold posed by a no evidence case  Mr Wiegand in the circumstances is unable to cross it  This conclusion of itself would be sufficient to dismiss the application   I should add for the sake of completeness that I have reached a like view on the compassionate leave question  The evidence of its contributing effect might be considered slight but there nonetheless was evidence of such a contribution before the Tribunal citedSchmid v Comcare   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  I should state at the outset  as has been acknowledged by others  see Schmid v Comcare   FCA   at par     there is a high threshold for treating a finding of fact as giving rise to an error of law  I would note that in Roads Corporation v Dacakis     VR   at   it was said         a finding of fact will only be open to challenge as erroneous in law if there is no probative evidence to support it  and not also if it is not reasonably open on the evidence  whilst an inference will only be open to challenge as being erroneous in law if it was not reasonably open on the facts  emphasis in original    I emphasise this matter because an appeal to this Court under s   can only be made on a question
