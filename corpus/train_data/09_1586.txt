Australian Securities   Investments Commission v Fortescue Metals Group Ltd  No     FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toAdler v Australian Securities   Investments Commission   NSWCA         FLR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  htmlThe rule in Jones v Dunkel was discussed however in Adler v Australian Securities   Investments Commission   NSWCA         FLR     Williams v Australian Securities   Investments Commission   NSWCA         ACSR     a judgment handed down before the High Court s Rich ruling  where the New South Wales Court of Appeal ruled that the trial judge  Santow J     NSWSC       ACSR     made no error in so far as his findings against Mr Adler  his company and Mr Williams were aided by Jones v Dunkel inferences against both those individuals and the company  In that proceeding ASIC had sought  inter alia   disqualification orders as well as pecuniary penalties  Giles JA  with whom Mason P and Beazley JA agreed  considered the High Court criminal cases discussed above and noted at   that proceedings for civil penalties do not share the same fundamental features of a criminal trial  His Honour stated that civil penalty proceedings are expressly to be maintained by civil law processes  not by a criminal trial with its fundamental features     He concluded that it was open for Jones v Dunkel inferences to be drawn against Mr Adler  his company  and Mr Williams in the proceedings     The rulings in Adler were therefore made on the footing that the privilege against exposure to penalty was attracted through ASIC s seeking of pecuniary penalties  but this did not prevent the trial judge from applying the rule in Jones v Dunkel  the rule and privilege both falling within the rules of evidence and procedure for civil matters that the court was bound to apply pursuant to s  L of the act when hearing proceedings for a declaration of contravention or a pecuniary penalty order  The High Court refused an application for special leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal s decision in Adler     HCATrans       May    The transcript reveals that the special leave point argued was the issue of procedural fairness in dealing with the imposition of pecuniary penalties and disqualification under the civil penalties regime of the Act  there was no discussion of the rule in Jones v Dunkel  consideredAnaconda Nickel Ltd v Tarmoola Australia Pty Ltd   WASCA         WAR  http www austlii edu au au cases wa WASCA  htmlForrest had known Huston for a number of years prior to this  Huston acted as solicitor for Anaconda Nickel Ltd in proceedings in the Supreme Court of Western Australia culminating in an appeal to the Full Court  Anaconda Nickel Ltd v Tarmoola Australia Pty Ltd   WASCA         WAR    These proceedings concerned the enforceability of a short letter said to be a  heads of agreement   In certain respects it bears a remarkable similarity to the framework agreements  The majority  Ipp J  Pidgeon J agreeing  held that the heads of agreement was a valid and binding agreement  Huston helped prepare the draft as well as the final   November Letter concerning the three framework agreements provided by FMG to the ASX that day  He attended a meeting with Mr Tony Walsh  Assistant Manager Issuers of the ASX  on   November   relevantly to discuss this draft for the purpose of providing further information to the ASX as to the terms of the framework agreements  I have concluded that  for this purpose  Huston would have considered the terms of the related   November Letter and the three framework agreements referred to in that letter  He did not advise the FMG Board or Forrest that these agreements were not legally binding or that the   November Letter was to that extent incorrect or not reasonably based  Given his role in FMG  had he formed that view  I find that he should have and would have informed the board  That he did not  entitled the board and Forrest to continue to regard the disclosures concerning the legal effect of the framework agreements as correct  or at least that they were reasonably based  That this was so is fortified by evidence of actual advice given by Huston to the FMG board that the framework agreements were legally binding as disclosed  The FMG board minutes of its   January   meeting  attended by Huston  record his advice to the board that the CMCC Framework Agreement was binding  So too did an email sent by him on   March   to Forrest  Christopher Catlow  David Liu  Rowley  Alan Watling and other FMG executives concerning the AFR Article in which he repeated this advice  relying in particular upon the Anaconda decision  The   March   email was not disclosed in ASIC s pleading  While the minutes of the   January board meeting were set out as a particular of two allegations concerning FMG s and Forrest s knowledge of the Chinese Contractors  attitude towards the framework agreements and of the legal effect of the agreements  ASIC did not particularise the material passage in the minutes where Huston s legal advice to the board was set out  nor did it refer to this passage in its opening or closing submissions  This is so  despite the fact that  in relation to ASIC s s   case  it asserted  amongst other things  that FMG ought to have been aware of the legal effect of the framework agreements asserted by ASIC by first obtaining competent legal advice  Huston was a very experienced and competent commercial solicitor  I was not referred to these documents during the trial until the closing address by Forrest s senior counsel  Mr Myers QC  Their content  combined with other evidence  demonstrates that there was no basis for ASIC to assert dishonesty on the part of FMG  its board and in particular  Forrest  I make the same criticism of the description applied to FMG and by implication its board and particularly Forrest in the way ASIC s case was opened  It was asserted that FMG engaged in a concerted and designed course of conduct in which it made false  misleading and exaggerated statements to the ASX of which Forrest was the architect  In my view the evidence does not support such serious allegations  The principal basis  it seems  depends on ASIC s submission that the framework agreements are self evidently not binding build and transfer agreements  I rejected that argument  I consider that there was a reasonable basis for FMG  through its board  including Forrest  to have held the view that the framework agreements were binding as claimed  It was supported by Huston s professional oversight to ensure the legal enforceability of FMG s agreements as well as his later positive advice to the effect that they were such  It was a view consistent with Forrest s knowledge of the Anaconda case  It finds arguable support in other authority  Significantly too  CREC approved the terms of the   August Media Release before FMG made the notifications to the ASX on   August    The release described the CREC Framework Agreement as a  binding agreement to build and finance the railway component of Fortescue Metals Group Ltd s     billion Pilbara iron ore project   In the release Mr Qin Jiaming  Qin  the President of CREC  is quoted as saying that the contract presented an excellent opportunity for CREC to develop internationally and that CREC was fully confident about its capacity to build the rail project  It was described by him as a  marriage  immediately following the high level ceremony when the parties signed the Joint Statement which rendered the agreement binding  I find that the terms of the   November Media Release provided to CHEC and CMCC was likewise approved  at least not disavowed  by them before disclosure to the ASX by FMG  For at least these reasons  it is important that allegations of dishonesty should be made only where there is a reasonable evidentiary basis for them  It is my opinion that on the totality of the evidence available to ASIC there was no such basis in this case  Notwithstanding that ASIC s assertions as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements differs from that disclosed by FMG to the knowledge of Forrest  this difference  which  in effect  is a difference of opinion does not of itself provide a basis for alleging dishonesty against FMG  its board and in particular Forrest  FMG s opinion was underpinned by the oversight and advice of its in house counsel Huston  Forrest had his knowledge and experience in Anaconda to draw upon   Documents demonstrating these significant matters were available to ASIC  In light of these it is difficult to discern why ASIC ran a case alleging that FMG s board could not have made the disclosures it did if it had obtained competent legal advice  The board of FMG had no reason to doubt the correctness of Huston s view as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements  He was employed by FMG primarily to ensure that all of FMG s agreements were legally enforceable  The reasonableness of FMG s opinion was strongly contended for by senior counsel for both FMG and Forrest at trial  It was an opinion which I consider was reasonably open  In my view  these allegations of dishonesty should not have been made  I have no hesitation in concluding that FMG and its board  including Forrest  honestly and reasonably held the opinion that the framework agreements were legally enforceable in the sense asserted in FMG s disclosures  They did not hold the opinions propounded by ASIC  Those opinions do not self evidently and obviously arise upon a consideration of the terms of the framework agreements  PART   EVIDENTIARY MATTERS   Standard of proof ASIC submits in written closing submission that the authorities such as Anaconda  Pagnan SpA  Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games Ltd     NSWLR   and Uranium Equities v Fewster   WASCA         WAR   relied on by FMG state that whether or not the parties intended to contract  they must agree on such terms  normally described as essential terms  such that the contract could be enforced or made complete by implying terms or applying considerations of reasonableness  I will consider these authorities further  In Anaconda   WASCA       WAR     the Court of Appeal found that a binding contract had been made when a heads of agreement containing five clauses was signed  the last paragraph of which said that the heads of agreement  constituted an agreement in itself intended to be replaced by a fuller agreement not different in substance or form   At   Ipp J referred to the following statement by Sugerman J  approved by Menzies J in Thorby v Goldberg   HCA         CLR   at    It is a first principle of the law of contracts that there can be no binding and enforceable obligation unless the terms of the bargain  or at least its essential and critical terms  have been agreed upon  So  there is no concluded contract where an essential or critical term is expressly left to be settled by future agreement of the parties  Again  there is no binding contract where the language used is so obscure and incapable of any precise or definite meaning that the court is unable to attribute to the parties any particular contractual intentions  In Uranium Equities   WASCA       WAR     the parties to the putative agreement had been negotiating over a proposed mining joint venture  but no heads of agreement had been executed  The Court found that the trial judge was right in concluding that the parties did not intend to be bound by anything said or done by them until such time as the heads of agreement had been executed  The Court went on to state on the question of uncertainty at   that it is  trite  that  even when the requisite intention is present  a contract can fail for uncertainty  The Court said it is also trite that only the omission of an essential term will have the effect that a contract is so incomplete or uncertain as to render it invalid  citing Ipp J in Anaconda   WASCA       WAR   at     The Court referred to the statement of Lloyd LJ from Pagnan SpA     Lloyd s Rep at   and found that when regard was had to all the circumstances the parties did not intend to be bound by anything said or done by them until such time as the heads of agreement had been executed   The Court concluded that although some of the matters left over by the parties for future negotiation were important  none were essential to the efficacy of the alleged agreement in the sense that the agreement could not be enforced without it  ASIC also points to the absence of the following from the framework agreements  no provision for choice of contractors or the selection of materials  no definition of  practical completion  and no specifications for any design elements of the infrastructure  The documents referred to in the Recitals to each agreement would have  no doubt  assisted in clarifying the matters absent from the agreements  In light of those documents  following the approach of Ipp J in Anaconda   WASCA       WAR   at     it may have been possible to conclude that  despite the long list of matters said to render the framework agreements uncertain and incomplete  there was a binding contract  workable by implying terms or on the proper construction of the agreement  The court will apply orthodox principles of implying terms by reference to the implied duty to co operate and use considerations of reasonableness  to give effect to that intention  Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games   NSWLR   Moffat Property Development Group Pty Ltd v Hebron Park Pty Ltd   QCA    The asserted uncertainty or incompleteness may therefore be overcome once the requisite intention to contract is found to be present  In Anaconda   WASCA       WAR     the issue was whether a binding contract for Anaconda  a company interested in lateritic nickel  to explore and mine for base metals on the tenements of Tarmoola  a company interested mainly in gold  had been made when a heads of agreement containing five clauses was signed  the last paragraph of which said that the heads of agreement   constitutes an agreement in itself intended to be replaced by a fuller agreement not different in substance or form    Tarmoola argued that there was no intention to contract  no agreement on essential terms  and that the agreement was incomplete and uncertain  By majority  the WA Full Court rejected these arguments and held that the heads of agreement was a binding contract  Ipp J  with whom Pidgeon J agreed  found that contractual intention was present  His Honour endorsed the existence of the fourth Masters v Cameron category in stating   It is well recognised that parties may enter into a valid contract containing a limited number of terms comprising those terms essential to the bargain that they wish to conclude  in the expectation that at a later date a further contract will be arrived at containing additional terms that would facilitate and clarify the initial contract  That is to say  a binding contract may be arrived at even though it leaves unresolved many matters which might arise in future   Since Anaconda was decided by the Court of Appeal on   February   it has been cited  considered or applied without disapproval in a number of contract law cases involving questions of incompleteness or uncertainty  for example  Duskwood Pty Ltd v Bellara Willows Pty Ltd   per Steytler J at   Liristis Holdings Pty Ltd v Wallville Pty Ltd   NSWSC   per Barrett J at   African Minerals Limited v Pan Palladium Limited   NSWSC   per Einstein J at   Thompson v White   Ors   NSWCA   per Tobias JA with whom Ipp and McColl JJA agreed at   Tasman Capital Pty Ltd v Sinclair   NSWCA   per Giles JA with whom McColl JA and Young CJ in EQ agreed at     Donald Fin Enterprises Pty Ltd v APIR Systems Ltd     ACSR   per Edmonds J at     Strzelecki Holdings Pty Ltd v Cable Sands Pty Ltd  No     WASC   per Murray J at    The approach taken in G R Securities   NSWLR   Anaconda   WASCA       WAR   and Tasman Capital   NSWCA   was followed very recently by the Queensland Court of Appeal in Moffat Property Development Group   QCA     mentioned above  which underlined the importance of the parties  manifest intention to contract  The issue was whether a contract for the sale of rural residential land had been made by an exchange of letters  The Queensland Court of Appeal held that the parties intended to be legally bound through their exchange of correspondence and that there was a contract even though matters such as the timing of completion and arrangements at settlement  the precise timing of the payment of the deposit  the place of settlement  responsibility for insurance  GST issues and the terms of a put and call option were not spelt out in the correspondence  Keane JA delivered the court s judgment  His Honour   a  accepted McHugh JA s point in G R Securities that  the decisive issue is always the intention of the parties       b  said  the terms of the correspondence exchanged between the parties contemplated the execution of a further contract as the means whereby the bargain which they had concluded would be implemented  It is necessarily implicit in such an agreement that the parties will co operate to do what must be done to make the further agreement     c  adopted McHugh JA s approach in G R Securities and explained that the implied obligation of each party to co operate with the other to ensure each side obtains the benefit of its bargain serves to supply the deficiencies     d  cited Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games   NSWLR at   in stating   I am of the view that there can be no doubt as to the orthodoxy of referring to  implied terms or     considerations of reasonableness  in order to determine whether the parties   consensus is sufficiently comprehensive to be legally binding      Forrest had known Huston for a number of years prior to this  Huston acted as solicitor for Anaconda Nickel Ltd in proceedings against Tarmoola Australia Pty Ltd in the Supreme Court of Western Australia    WASCA         WAR    These concerned the enforceability of a short letter said to be a  heads of agreement   In certain respects it bears a remarkable similarity to the framework agreements  The then Full Court  in   by majority  Ipp J  Pidgeon J agreeing  held that the heads of agreement was a valid and binding agreement  The judgment in that case was the foundation of the view held and the advice given by Huston  It was a case which was already well known to Forrest  He had been Anaconda s CEO at the time of the litigation and its signatory to the heads of agreement which was the subject matter in the case  FMG and Forrest in particular  at least from the beginning of Oct   if not before  were focused on ensuring that FMG s agreements were legally enforceable  This included the framework agreements  It is apparent that one of Huston s principal roles at FMG was to oversee and ensure the legal enforceability or  as Forrest sometimes described it  the  bankability  of FMG s agreements  On   October   Forrest distributed a lengthy email to  amongst others  FMG executives and Huston in which he welcomed Huston to the team  Paragraph   with the heading  Legally binding contracts  included the following    Some agreements have been written in an ad hoc way with the best means available to the executive responsible  Unfortunately  on a full Bankers legal due diligence some of these may not pass the enforceability test       Gentlemen  please ensure with Peter complete legal enforceability on the agreements that we are all relying to construct FMG  The text of the email  almost entirely  concerns the three framework agreements  In context  therefore  I take this request by Forrest to be referring to  or at least to include  those agreements  Forrest concluded by saying      I am happy with the release  subject to P  Huston s sign off on the enforceability  to go   This appears to be a reference to a press release concerning an iron ore contract with a Chinese company called Hebei  It again evidences Forrest s quite specific concern that FMG s agreements were legally enforceable  On   October   after the execution of the CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements but before the formal Joint Statement signing ceremony in Beijing on   November   when those agreements became binding  Forrest sent an email to various FMG personnel  including Huston  where he referred approvingly to David Liu and his co ordination of the arrangements with the three Chinese Contractors  He also thanked Huston for his contribution  He said   Peter   Huston  thanks for the rappid  sic  fire support tonight  Hope we got your instructions right these contract  sic  better be bankable because people are signing them  David pls get the two we worked on today down to Peter for his all clear       I take the word  bankable  in this context to mean such as to satisfy potential FMG financiers  in the course of their due diligence process  as to the  legal enforceability  of these contracts  It is clear from the combination of the   January minutes and Huston s   March email that  in his opinion  the CMCC Framework Agreement was a binding build and transfer agreement  The case to which he referred was Anaconda Nickel Ltd v Tarmoola Australia Pty Ltd   WASCA       WAR   which I have referred to previously  That case concerned the enforceability of a letter containing   clauses and described as a  heads of agreement  signed by Forrest who then was Chief Executive of Anaconda  The letter concluded  in terms not dissimilar to clause   in each of the framework agreements   The above forms a heads of agreement which constitutes an agreement in itself intended to be replaced by a fuller agreement not different in substance or form  The respondent  Tarmoola  signed the letter confirming its agreement to the tems and conditions set out in it  The parties then entered into negotiations for the  fuller agreement  but those negotiations were unsuccessful  No  fuller agreement  was concluded  Anaconda   amongst other relief  sought a declaration that the heads of agreement was a valid and binding contract  The respondent argued that it was not so bound on a number of bases  including lack of intention to create a binding legal relationship because so many important matters had been omitted  lack of certainty and completeness of the contract  The appeal was successful and the declaration was granted  Tarmoola s application to the High Court for special leave to appeal  P  was discontinued  Huston   I infer  during the period he was overseeing FMG s agreements  had a detailed knowledge of this case and the reasons for judgment  He was Anaconda s instructing solicitor in that case  As ASIC pleads  Huston was an experienced and practising commercial solicitor  He had  as I have said  been directly involved in preparing the   November Letter which concerned all three framework agreements  One of Huston s principal responsibilities was to ensure that FMG s agreements were legally enforceable  He had not suggested to the FMG Board  including Forrest  that the framework agreements were not legally enforceable  His opinion expressed in the   January   board minutes and the   March   email that the CMCC Framework Agreement was binding necessarily must have applied to the other two framework agreements  FMG s and Forrest s opinion as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements was shaped and informed by Huston s involvement  They had the benefit of his dedicated professional oversight and later his advice as to the legal enforceability of the framework agreements  Forrest as CEO  was directly involved in the Anaconda case and would have been well aware of the judgments both at first instance and on appeal as well as the discontinuance of Tarmoola s application for special leave to appeal to the High Court  Forrest then had the benefit of legal advice in relation to the legal enforceability of a similar agreement  Huston alluded to this in his   March   email when he stated  referring to the Anaconda decision   Thus if journalist s  want to know why Andrew  Forrest  considers the  C MCC agreement to be binding he is amongst other things relying on his own direct experience from this  S upreme Court Case  All relevant FMG staff had been told by Forrest in early October to ensure  through Huston  that FMG agreements were legally enforceable  The evidence also demonstrates that  contrary to ASIC s assertion  Huston did give legal advice to FMG as to the legal enforceability of the framework agreements  In particular  the   January minutes show that the FMG board turned its mind to the question of whether the CMCC Framework Agreement was binding following the statement by Mr Ma at the   January meeting  that it sought legal advice on that question from Huston and that he answered the question in the affirmative  If  as I think likely  although I make no finding  he was asked to advise on the issue of the legal enforceability of the CREC Framework Agreement prior to the   August notification  it is reasonable to infer that his opinion and reasons for it were  or would have been  the same as he later twice provided to FMG s board  I consider that Forrest exercised his powers and discharged his duties with the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person would exercise if they were a director or officer of FMG in FMG s circumstances  and if they occupied the offices of Forrest within FMG and had the same responsibilities within FMG as Forrest  Forrest  as I have explained earlier in detail  as a consequence of his own appreciation of the decision in Anaconda  his reliance on the legal oversight and advice of Huston  and his appreciation that the Chinese Contractors held the same view that the framework agreements were legally binding  had reasonable grounds for approving or permitting to be made the disclosures  complained of by ASIC  by FMG between August   and March    I am well satisfied that Forrest acted reasonably to ensure that FMG both complied with s   of the Act and did not contravene s  H of the Act  He did not breach s   of the Act as alleged by ASIC or at all  Given the conclusions to which I have come concerning ASIC s case under s  H I do not consider it necessary to deal with Forrest s further defence based in s   concerning the Business judgment rule  For all these reasons ASIC s Application against each of the defendants should be dismissed  ASIC should pay the costs of each of the defendants  There will be orders accordingly    I certify that the preceding nine hundred and six   numbered paragraphs

cases cth HCA  htmlIn Ansett Transport Industries  Operations  Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth of Australia   HCA         CLR   at     Mason J said   No doubt it is correct to say that  where in the recitals to a deed or an agreement it is acknowledged that the parties have agreed to do  or will do  certain acts  a promise to do those acts will be read into the agreement in the absence of an express promise to that effect  Then  there being no indication of a contrary intention  it may safely be inferred that the absence of a contractual provision was due to oversight or inadvertence  It can be seen from the recitals that FMG accepted CREC s offer to  execute the Works  namely the  Build and Transfer  of the railway  Applying Mason J s proposition in Ansett Transport Industries   HCA       CLR     CREC s promise to build and transfer the railway may  arguably  be read into the operational part of the agreement  there being no indication of a contrary intention  Accordingly  in my view  it is arguable and reasonably so that the Recitals of the agreement record the parameters of the intended agreement  that is  the offer and acceptance of the obligation to build and transfer the railway  Clause     arguably does not derogate from this obligation  This clause lists the matters which would be the subject of further development and agreement including definitive engineering design to Australian standards  Arguably this is a reference to the definitive feasibility study process which the parties knew had to be completed in order for details of their agreement to be worked out and in particular would define the scope of the Works  the scheduling of the Works and the cost of the Works  Clause   provides that   This document represents an agreement in itself and it is recognised a fuller and more detailed agreement not different in intent from this agreement will be developed later citedAspdin v Austin     QB  Authority supports an argument that the agreement recorded in the recitals for CREC to build or  execute  the railway should be given effect and should be treated as an agreement between FMG and CREC even where the operative provisions of the framework agreement do not contain such a provision and there is nothing inconsistent with such a construction in the operative provisions  Buckland v Buckland     Ch   at     MacKenzie v Childers     Ch D   at             Ex parte Dawes  in re Moon     QBD                 Aspdin v Austin     QB   at    This is even more so where  as here  the framework agreements were not drawn by lawyers  They were drafted by Heyting  an engineer  who also holds a Masters of Business Administration and who had some training in contract management  In those circumstances  arguably  a distinction between recitals and operational clauses should not be rigorously applied in an attempt to determine the parties  intention  determined objectively  Expressly  the recitals proceed on the basis that there is an agreement for the relevant Chinese contractor to build the infrastructure which is sought to be recorded in the framework agreements  The recitals do not say or imply that what follows is merely an informal arrangement  or a mere agreement to negotiate citedAustralian Broadcasting Commission v Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlFMG makes the following submission which I accept as a correct statement of the law  The proper construction of an agreement should be determined by what reasonable people in the position of the parties would have understood by the relevant clauses by considering not only their text  but also the surrounding circumstances and the purpose and object of the transaction  e g  Pacific

HCA         CLR   at    Gibbs J  in dissent  but not on the applicable principle  referred toAustralian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games     NSWLR  ASIC submits in written closing submission that the authorities such as Anaconda  Pagnan SpA  Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games Ltd     NSWLR   and Uranium Equities v Fewster   WASCA         WAR   relied on by FMG state that whether or not the parties intended to contract  they must agree on such terms  normally described as essential terms  such that the contract could be enforced or made complete by implying terms or applying considerations of reasonableness  I will consider these authorities further  In Anaconda   WASCA       WAR     the Court of Appeal found that a binding contract had been made when a heads of agreement containing five clauses was signed  the last paragraph of which said that the heads of agreement  constituted an agreement in itself intended to be replaced by a fuller agreement not different in substance or form   At   Ipp J referred to the following statement by Sugerman J  approved by Menzies J in Thorby v Goldberg   HCA         CLR   at    It is a first principle of the law of contracts that there can be no binding and enforceable obligation unless the terms of the bargain  or at least its essential and critical terms  have been agreed upon  So  there is no concluded contract where an essential or critical term is expressly left to be settled by future agreement of the parties  Again  there is no binding contract where the language used is so obscure and incapable of any precise or definite meaning that the court is unable to attribute to the parties any particular contractual intentions  In Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games   NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  with whom Hope and Mahoney JJA agreed  confirmed at  E F the importance in a Masters v Cameron type of dispute of assessing the parties  intention to make a concluded bargain  and stated that the question of intention is distinct from  although it may be closely related to  the question whether the parties have reached agreement upon such terms as are  in the circumstances  legally necessary to constitute a contract  His Honour stated   Nevertheless  in the ordinary case  as a matter of fact and commonsense other things being equal  the more numerous and significant the areas in respect of which the parties have failed to reach agreement  the slower a court will be to conclude that they had the requisite contractual intention  ASIC also points to the absence of the following from the framework agreements  no provision for choice of contractors or the selection of materials  no definition of  practical completion  and no specifications for any design elements of the infrastructure  The documents referred to in the Recitals to each agreement would have  no doubt  assisted in clarifying the matters absent from the agreements  In light of those documents  following the approach of Ipp J in Anaconda   WASCA       WAR   at     it may have been possible to conclude that  despite the long list of matters said to render the framework agreements uncertain and incomplete  there was a binding contract  workable by implying terms or on the proper construction of the agreement  The court will apply orthodox principles of implying terms by reference to the implied duty to co operate and use considerations of reasonableness  to give effect to that intention  Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games   NSWLR   Moffat Property Development Group Pty Ltd v Hebron Park Pty Ltd   QCA    The asserted uncertainty or incompleteness may therefore be overcome once the requisite intention to contract is found to be present  The approach taken in G R Securities   NSWLR   Anaconda   WASCA       WAR   and Tasman Capital   NSWCA   was followed very recently by the Queensland Court of Appeal in Moffat Property Development Group   QCA     mentioned above  which underlined the importance of the parties  manifest intention to contract  The issue was whether a contract for the sale of rural residential land had been made by an exchange of letters  The Queensland Court of Appeal held that the parties intended to be legally bound through their exchange of correspondence and that there was a contract even though matters such as the timing of completion and arrangements at settlement  the precise timing of the payment of the deposit  the place of settlement  responsibility for insurance  GST issues and the terms of a put and call option were not spelt out in the correspondence  Keane JA delivered the court s judgment  His Honour   a  accepted McHugh JA s point in G R Securities that  the decisive issue is always the intention of the parties       b  said  the terms of the correspondence exchanged between the parties contemplated the execution of a further contract as the means whereby the bargain which they had concluded would be implemented  It is necessarily implicit in such an agreement that the parties will co operate to do what must be done to make the further agreement     c  adopted McHugh JA s approach in G R Securities and explained that the implied obligation of each party to co operate with the other to ensure each side obtains the benefit of its bargain serves to supply the deficiencies     d  cited Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games   NSWLR at   in stating   I am of the view that there can be no doubt as to the orthodoxy of referring to  implied terms or     considerations of reasonableness  in order to determine whether the parties   consensus is sufficiently comprehensive to be legally binding     consideredAustralian

circumstances in which the admissions of a servant or agent in relation to past events may be admissible against the principal  A servant or agent may have authority to make admissions about past events by virtue of the servant s or agent s general or specifically delegated authority to answer inquires of a particular nature  see TNT Management at    The inquiries may include dealing with investigating authorities in any matter concerning the business  see Nicholas Enterprises at    Senior counsel for ASIC submits that s   of the Evidence Act may be applied to admissions in a s

issue with the authenticity of the signatures of Rowley and Watling on the transcripts  He also indicated that FMG had no objection to my reading those transcripts and deriving from them whatever assistance I could  However  he said the representations in the transcripts could not be viewed as admissions because they were not adverse to FMG s case  In Part   of the Dictionary of the Evidence Act    admission  is defined as follows    admission means a previous representation that is       a  made by a person who is or becomes a party to a proceeding  including a defendant in a criminal proceeding  and        b  adverse to the person s interest in the outcome of the proceeding citedAustralian Competition   Consumer Commission v Mayo International Pty Ltd   ATPR    Merkel J noted at

is found in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd     FCR     where Hill J stated at    Where the proceedings are criminal  and the present proceedings are not  they are proceedings  inter alia  for the recovery of a civil penalty  it might be thought that the failure of the accused to go into evidence should not lead to the drawing of Jones v Dunkel inferences  After all it is clear that a witness can not be compelled to give evidence which is likely to incriminate the witness or expose the witness to a penalty  However  even in criminal cases it has been held that the failure of the accused  who is in a position to deny  explain or answer the evidence adduced by the prosecution  to give evidence will permit the jury to draw inferences adverse to the accused more readily  see Azzopardi v R   HCA         ALR     affirming Weissensteiner v R   HCA         CLR    A fortiori  therefore  the failure of a respondent to proceedings for recovery of a pecuniary penalty to give evidence on a matter relevant to an issue in the proceeding and deny  explain or answer the evidence adduced against the respondent will permit the Court more readily to draw the inferences to which the decision in Jones v Dunkel refers  In Council of the New South Wales Bar Association v Power   NSWCA         NSWLR   at     a proceeding seeking removal of a legal practitioner from the Roll  Hodgson JA  with whom Beazley and McColl JJA agreed  referred to the High Court s conclusion in Azzopardi   HCA       CLR   that it was open to a trial judge in a criminal case to make a comment relating to the absence of evidence of additional facts peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused  Hodgson JA went on to say at   concerning the case before him that   If this had been a criminal trial  then in my opinion what the High Court said in Azzopardi would have meant that a jury could have been told that inferences from proved facts could more safely be drawn because the opponent elected not to give any explanation in terms of additional facts peculiarly within his knowledge or any evidence of such facts  In my opinion  if such Jones v Dunkel reasoning is available to a jury in a criminal trial  it must a fortiori be available to a court in civil proceedings such as the present  That would be so  even if these civil proceedings are regarded as proceedings for a civil penalty  I note that a similar view was expressed by Hill J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR   at

Macdonald  No     NSWSC       ALR    It submits that the information about the Deed of Covenant and Indemnity which formed the basis of ASIC s claim against James Hardie Industries Limited made under the predecessor section to s   was information about the significance and effect of that Deed  at   as to which the defendants were too emphatic in understating the effect of this information in market releases  Yet what occurred there was the complete failure by the company to disclose the existence of certain covenants  an indemnity and the obligation to make certain payments  It was not a case  such as the present  involving  in effect  differing opinions as to the meaning and effect of agreements as a whole  I do not find it  in that respect  to be of any assistance  I will then  against this background  consider whether the only reasonable opinion as to the meaning and legal effect of each framework agreement is as expressed in the Informations or whether the opinion of FMG that each was an enforceable agreement to build  transfer and finance the relevant Project infrastructure was reasonably held  It is accepted that  in substance  each framework agreement is mutatis mutandis to the same effect  I will consider then the CREC Framework Agreement  However my conclusions will apply to all three framework agreements  ASIC submits that had such advice been obtained  the misleading statements could not have been made by a responsible company or board of directors and that the failure by FMG to obtain legal advice is a relevant consideration  ASIC did not lead expert opinion evidence as to what such an opinion was likely to have been had it been sought  ASIC referred to ASIC v Macdonald   NSWSC       ALR    There  Gzell J found at   that ASIC had made out its case that the company  James Hardie Industries Limited  negligently failed to disclose information concerning the restructuring of the company in contravention of Listing Rule     and s  A  of the Corporations Law as carried over into the Act for reasons including that it did not obtain any legal advice as to whether it should disclose the information  The information did not consist of an opinion as to the meaning and legal effect of an agreement  ASIC pleads at ASC   that by   January   FMG and Forrest were aware firstly that CREC  CHEC and CMCC did not regard the framework agreements as requiring them to construct and finance the infrastructure necessary for the Project  and secondly that the agreements did not have the effect of obliging those companies to construct and finance the infrastructure  Among the particulars relied on by ASIC to establish FMG s and Forrest s knowledge are the minutes of a meeting of FMG s directors including Forrest on   January   and Huston s attendance at the meetings on   and   January   involving FMG and the representatives of CREC  CHEC and CMCC  together with Huston s status as a qualified  experienced and practicing commercial solicitor  I have discussed in some detail the meetings of   and   January in Part    At those meetings  FMG and the Chinese Contractors discussed their relationship and sought to reach agreement on the size of the equity interest that FMG would grant to a Chinese entity  I have found that the Chinese suggestion at the   January meeting that the previous agreements were merely MOUs was a negotiating tactic employed to advance their case for a majority equity interest in the Project  ASIC did not specify in its pleading what aspect of the   January minutes it was relying on to establish either or both of these assertions  In fact  ASIC made no reference to this document in oral or written submissions  Further  ASIC did not plead nor explain in submissions just how it was that Huston s attendance at the   and   January meetings and his status as a qualified  experienced and practicing commercial solicitor advanced ASIC s assertions  The CHEC Framework Agreement was executed on   October    The CMCC Framework Agreement was executed on   October    In ASIC v Macdonald  No     NSWSC       ALR   at the time of both alleged continuous disclosure contraventions there was a negative perception in the market place in relation to the shares of the holding company due to its asbestos liability  Gzell J noted at   that the reasonable person would think on receipt of the information concerning the covenants and indemnities that the company s asbestos claim liability had been controlled and that the blight upon its share price had been removed  In relation to the second set of information  his Honour noted that the severing of the company s connection to its asbestos liability was positive information and likely to reduce negative sentiment in the market regarding the company s shares     ASIC refers to the recent decision of Gzell J in ASIC v Macdonald  No     NSWSC       ALR   where Mr Macdonald  the chief executive officer and a director of James Hardie Industries Limited was held to have contravened s   by  making false or misleading statements at a press conference  and   approving  or failing to advise not to release  or failing to remove matters that were false or misleading from  an ASX announcement which contained over emphatic statements and which were false or misleading  Mr Macdonald and number of other directors were also held to have contravened s   by approving a draft ASX announcement which contained false or misleading or deceptive statements about the funding of a medical research and compensation fund that the company was establishing  His Honour stated that the directors ought to have been and they should have realised that they were prevented from approving the unequivocal and unqualified statements as to certainty of sufficient funding in the draft announcement  In the present case  ASIC pleads  ASC  b  that the information in each of FMG s disclosures was published to  persons who commonly invest in securities in the ASX s financial market   Further  ASIC pleads that FMG s conduct in publishing the information  making the statements and representations  or creating the impressions associated with the disclosures was conduct  designed to encourage reasonable investors in the ASX s financial market to invest  or to continue investments  in the First Defendant   This formulation I regard as no different  in substance  to the language of s   of the Act  namely the question of the influence or likely influence of information upon common investors  I do not think it is intended by ASIC to describe an actual causal consequence but merely an encouraging or influencing factor  ASIC  borrowing from the language of Gzell J  submits that FMG s and Forrest s disclosures to the market between   August   and   March   were likewise emphatic  unequivocal and unqualified  Thus while ASIC is not required to prove that FMG intended to engage in misleading or deceptive conduct to establish contraventions of s  H  evidence of intent will allow the Court to readily infer that the intention has been effective  ASIC submits that the evidence supports a finding that FMG and Forrest in particular intended to mislead and deceive investors and potential investors in FMG shares  The Representees The various persons to whom ASIC claims FMG made the disclosures were  reasonable investors in the ASX s financial market  media publishers  the audience of the media publishers  persons obtaining access to media releases  FMG s letters to the ASX and other company reports on FMG s website  media representatives who attended a telephone press conference conducted by Mr Forrest on   August   the audience of the Business Sunday television program broadcast on or about   October   and attendees at conferences between August   and March   where Forrest gave presentations on behalf of FMG  Relevance of media commentary ASIC s claim that the disclosures were false and misleading is pleaded against a factual background summarised by ASIC at ASC   subparas  a  to  v   That background is derived from   documents listed in Schedule   to the ASC  The documents included in the Schedule are from the following sources  Letters  media releases  conference and meeting presentations  progress reports and statutory reports provided to the ASX by FMG  and  Media reports published by newswire services such as Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire  and by national and capital city newspapers including the Australian Financial Review  The Australian  The Sydney Morning Herald  The Age  and The West Australian  ASIC submits that the elements found in ASIC v Macdonald  No     NSWSC       ALR   that led Gzell J to find that Macdonald had breached his duties as a director are present in this case in that Forrest   a  was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer       b  had control and responsibility for the making of ASX announcements       c  was intimately involved in the preparation and approval of the various announcements and the later company presentations       d  knew full well that the statements were false  misleading and deceptive and that unqualified and emphatic statements could not be made concerning the execution of binding  build and transfer contracts by the three Chinese contractors       e  knew that the ASX announcements and the company presentations had been crafted to induce a positive effect on the price or value of FMG shares by positively influencing investors       f  knew that this conduct exposed FMG to serious risks to its reputation and placed it in likely contravention of important provisions of the Act       g  knew that the false announcements withheld from the market the true information concerning the terms  legal effect and significance of the actual framework agreements  which steps placed FMG at risk of likely contravention of s    It is not in issue that Forrest was  at all material times prior to about   May   the chairman of directors and chief executive officer of the first defendant  and that he has  since on or about   May   been FMG s chief executive officer  In his closing written submissions  Forrest points out that ASIC did not tender any direct evidence regarding his  or any other FMG directors  duties or call expert evidence regarding the role of a director or a chief executive officer in a company like FMG at the material times  Forrest also points out that ASIC had sought to tender parts of his s   ASIC Act examination transcript but withdrew the tender after he sought to include parts of the explanatory and contextual portions of his examination transcript  ASIC emphasized the recent judgment in ASIC v Macdonald  No     NSWSC       ALR     where Gzell J held that the Chief Executive Officer  Macdonald  and a number of other directors  had breached their duties under s    Gzell J held that Macdonald failed to advise the board of the company that the draft ASX announcement was expressed in too emphatic terms concerning the sufficiency of funds held by the foundation to meet all legitimate asbestos claims and that as a result the ASX announcement was misleading and deceptive  He also found that Macdonald failed to properly advise the board as to the fact that the cash flow model supporting the statements concerning funding had not verified the key assumptions contained in the model  I have already considered this case  which turns on its own facts  It is of no particular assistance in the resolution of this issue concerning Forrest  Forrest does not dispute that he knew of FMG s duties regarding Listing Rule     but says FMG did not breach s   of the Act  Alternatively  Forrest says  if FMG breached s   of the Act  which is denied  for the reasons regarding Forrest s honest and reasonable beliefs  a reasonable person in Forrest s position and FMG s circumstances would have acted the same way that Forrest did referred toAustralian

investors    relevant jeopardy to the interests of the company may be found in the actual or potential exposure of the company to civil penalties or other liability under the act  and it may no doubt be a breach of the relevant duty for a director to embark on or authorise a course which attracts the risk of that exposure  at least if the risk is clear and the countervailing potential benefits

Ltd  CTF   The respondent was involved in the writing of an  ASX Release  which claimed that CTF s products could reduce the spread of four major viruses including HIV AIDS  The respondent instructed CTF s secretary to send the statement to the Australian Stock Exchange who published it  The statement affected the price of CTF shares  It was held at first instance that the ASX Release did not contain representations  in relation to  CTF s shares pursuant to s  H of the Act because the statement did not refer to shares on the face of it  or deal with the shares directly  This construction was rejected by the Full Court which held that the phase  in relation to  in s  H of the Act only requires an indirect or less than substantial connection between the misleading conduct or statement and the financial product and that it is not necessary for a statement to expressly refer to the shares or to deal with the shares on its face  In deciding that the respondent engaged in conduct in relation to a financial product  CTF s shares  by publishing the statement on the ASX  Finkelstein J held that there was a sufficient connection between the statement and CTF s shares by reason of   the content of the statements  which concerned the business of CTF  and   the place of their publication  namely on the the exchange where the shares were traded  Jacobson and Gordon JJ said the concept of misleading and deceptive conduct is one which embraces all of the circumstances in which the conduct takes place  and that the relevant conduct was not merely the text of the announcement  Their Honours said the statement was an announcement made to the ASX about a  landmark  test result for the company s products and was disclosure to the market  Forrest submits that the Court s ratio in Narain was that CTF s representations contained in announcements made to the ASX were  in relation to a financial product  because the representations were published where shares were traded  I do not think this was what their Honour s intended although the announcement in that case was made to the ASX  For Finkelstein J  the publication on the ASX was just one of two factors giving rise to the connection between the statement and the relevant financial product  The RIU Explorers Conference brochure discloses that it was attended by representatives of a considerable number of mining

from  China Metallurgical   These are references to CREC  CHEC and CMCC  The amounts are said to be  under agreement   I accept that this conveys the impression of binding agreements between FMG and each of those companies  This information lies in the context of public knowledge of the fact of the execution of these three agreements as binding agreements  They therefore constitute  in effect  a re publication of that information to the market and therefore is conduct in relation to a financial product  I am satisfied that the first and second disclosures constituted conduct by FMG in

defendants in civil penalty proceedings brought by ASIC were not permitted to resist an order for discovery made by the trial judge by claiming the privilege against self exposure to penalty  The orders sought by ASIC included disqualification orders but not pecuniary penalties  The trial judge  Austin J  did not classify the proceedings as proceedings for the imposition of a penalty  Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich  No     NSWSC         ACLC     at    the Court of Appeal  Spigelman CJ  with whom Ipp JA agreed  McColl JA dissenting  upheld Austin J s ruling  identifying a disqualification order as having an exclusively protective purpose and stating that it should not be characterized as a penalty for the purposes of the penalty privilege  However  the High Court  Gleeson CJ  McHugh  Gummow  Hayne  Callinan and Heydon JJ  Kirby J dissenting  decided that the disqualification order was a penalty and accordingly the proper course was to refuse any order for discovery  per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne  Callinan and Heydon JJ at      The ruling was made in the joint judgment in consideration of s  L of the Act which requires the application of the rules of evidence and procedure for civil matters when hearing proceedings for a declaration of contravention or a pecuniary penalty order  Their honours concluded at   that that the statute itself requires the application of the body of law which has developed in relation to the privileges against penalties and forfeitures when deciding whether an order for discovery should be made  The Rich cases therefore turned on the issue of whether a disqualification order was a penalty  It was not in dispute that the privilege against exposure to penalty protected a defendant in civil proceedings not only from being obliged to give discovery  but also from being subject to any direction that affidavits or witness statements be provided to the plaintiff prior to the hearing or at any time prior to the conclusion of the plaintiff s case  see e g  Austin J at first instance    NSWSC         ACLC     at      In their judgments  neither the High Court nor the Court of Appeal considered the

edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe legislative history of the continuous disclosure provisions was reviewed by Lindgren J in Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Southcorp Ltd   FCA         FCR   at         I gratefully adopt his Honour s review in part    A review of the legislative history of the continuous disclosure provisions shows the importance that the legislature and the regulator have attached to them  and the publicity which has been given to them       In June   the then Commonwealth Attorney General  Michael Duffy  requested the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee  the Committee  to examine the need for a legislatively based continuous disclosure regime       The Committee reported in September    It noted that while the Corporations Law  the Law  required disclosure of information in particular sets of circumstances  it did not contain a comprehensive scheme for the full and accurate disclosure of market sensitive information on a timely basis  The Committee noted that Australian Stock Exchange  ASX  Listing Rules required a listed company or trust to notify its home exchange  immediately  of any information that was necessary to avoid the establishment of a false market in its securities  or that was likely to affect materially the price of its securities  The Committee recommended the introduction of a statute based enhanced disclosure regime which would    overcome the inability of general market forces to guarantee adequate and timely disclosure by disclosing entities  encourage greater securities research by investors and advisors  thereby ensuring that securities prices more closely  and quickly  reflect underlying economic values  ensure that equity and loan resources in the Australian market are more effectively channelled into appropriate investments  and that funds are withheld or withdrawn from poorly performing disclosing entities  This will promote capital market efficiency  assist debt holders in monitoring the performance of disclosing entities and thereby determine whether  or when  to exercise any right to withdraw or reinvest their loan funds  or convert debt to equity  act as a further  or substitute warning device for holders of charges over corporate assets  that breaches in covenants may have taken place  or the risk of default has increased  assist potential equity or debt holders of disclosing entities to better evaluate their investment alternatives  lessen the possible distorting effects of rumour on securities prices  minimise the opportunities for insider trading or similar market abuses  improve managerial performance and accountability by giving the market more timely indicators of corporate performance  encourage the growth of information systems within disclosing entities  This assists directors in their decision making and compliance with their fiduciary duties  and  reduce the time and costs involved when preparing takeover and prospectus documents     Following a process of consultation  the Government decided to introduce continuous disclosure provisions into the Law  On the Second Reading Speech on the Corporate Law Reform Act  No      Cth  which contained continuous disclosure provisions proposed to commence on   December   Senator Bolkus  Minister for Administrative Services  stated            an effective disclosure system will often be a significant inhibition on questionable corporate conduct  Knowledge that such conduct will be quickly exposed to the glare of publicity  as well as criticism by shareholders and the financial press  makes it less likely to occur in the first place              In essence  a well informed market leads to greater investor confidence and  in turn  to a greater willingness to invest in Australian business    Australia  Debates  Senate     p           The continuous disclosure provisions were eventually introduced as ss  A   B   C and  D of the Law by the Corporate Law Reform Act    Cth  s     Sch   Item   and commenced on   September    Subsection  A  provided that a listed disclosing entity must not contravene the continuous disclosure provisions of the listing rules of a securities exchange applicable to the entity  by  intentionally  recklessly  or negligently  failing to notify the securities exchange of information that was not generally available  and which  if it were generally available  a reasonable person would expect to have a material effect on the price or value of the securities of the entity  In November   the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee  CASAC  conducted a review of the continuous disclosure regime introduced in   and released a report entitled  Report on Continuous Disclosure   In that review  a survey had been conducted of listed disclosing entities  The CASAC report concluded that the regime was operating effectively for those entities  The report stated at para      Respondents to this survey considered that continuous disclosure had helped to keep the market  and investors in listed disclosing entities  more informed  Continuous disclosure also reinforced the obligations on directors and management to disclose material information to the market  Respondents considered that investors gained a better and more timely understanding of the issues facing the company and how these might affect the value of their shares  Continuous disclosure also encouraged listed entities to formalise their lines of internal communication to ensure that the directors and senior management were fully informed of all events affecting the price or value of the entity s securities  Overall  the respondents considered that continuous disclosure encouraged greater investor confidence in the price discovery mechanism of the securities market  The majority of the   listed disclosing entities who responded to the CASAC survey  indicated  in relation to question   dealing with external advice  that they had sought professional advice  mainly from law firms  on the application of continuous disclosure requirements  That advice included whether disclosure was required in the circumstances  the operation of the provisions which created exceptions to mandatory disclosure  and whether certain information would have a material effect on the price or value of securities  The present case includes consideration of whether legal advice was given to FMG concerning FMG s continuous disclosure obligations  the effect of any such legal advice and the reasonableness of the defendants  reliance on any such advice  On the commencement of the Financial Services Reform Act    Cth  on   March   s  A  which contained the original continuous disclosure obligations  was replaced by s   in a new Chapter  CA of the Act  The Revised Explanatory Memorandum for the Financial Services Reform Bill   explained that the placement of the continuous disclosure provisions near Chapter  D reflected the fact that these provisions deal with ongoing disclosure obligations in relation to securities as defined for the purposes of Chapters  D and    The Revised Explanatory Memorandum also explained   Proposed section     generally replicates section  A of the Corporations Act   subject to changes in terminology  In order to comply with the Criminal Code   the fault elements currently contained in subsections  A  and   have been omitted and the default fault elements under the Code will apply in future to offences against this provision  Proposed section   applies the Criminal Code to all offences in Chapter  CA at commencement  The Revised Explanatory Memorandum also explained that contravention of the continuous disclosure provisions would give rise to a liability for financial services civil penalty

chief executive officer or managing director may reasonably be expected to have more information available to him or her and to be more diligent than other board members  The title  Managing Director

http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn RPS   HCA       CLR     Azzopardi v The Queen   HCA         CLR   and Dyers   HCA       CLR     the High Court considered the applicability of the rule in Jones v Dunkel to criminal proceedings  It decided that the rule is of very limited application to defendants in criminal cases  its reasoning based on the accusatorial nature of criminal proceedings  As an illustration of the Court s approach  in Dyers   Gaudron and Hayne JJ stated at    As was pointed out in RPS      it will seldom  if ever  be reasonable to conclude that an accused in a criminal trial would be expected to give evidence  Not only is the accused not bound to give evidence  it is for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt  The mode of reasoning which is spoken of in     Jones v Dunkel   ordinarily  therefore  cannot be applied to a defendant in a criminal trial  That mode of reasoning depends upon a premise that the person concerned not only could shed light on the subject but also would ordinarily be expected to do so  The conclusion that an accused could shed light on the subject matter of the charge is a conclusion that would ordinarily be reached very easily  But given the accusatorial nature of a criminal trial  it cannot be said that  in such a proceeding  the accused would ordinarily be expected to give evidence  So to hold would be to deny that it is for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt  That is why the majority of the Court concluded  in RPS and in Azzopardi   that it is ordinarily inappropriate to tell the jury that some inference can be drawn from the fact that the accused has not given evidence  In Azzopardi   HCA       CLR     in their joint majority judgment Gaudron  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ referred to Weissensteiner v The Queen   HCA         CLR   where the High Court held it was appropriate for the trial judge to direct the jury as to the manner in which they might take into account the failure of the accused to give evidence  and their Honours stated at   that what was important in Weissensteiner and what warranted the remarks to the jury in that case was that  if there were facts which explained or contradicted the evidence against the accused  they were facts which were within the knowledge only of the accused  and thus could not be the subject of evidence from any other person or source  At   their Honours emphasised that cases in which a judge may comment on the failure of an accused to offer an explanation will be both rare and exceptional and will occur only if the evidence is capable of explanation by disclosure of additional facts known only to the accused  Their Honours said a comment will never be warranted merely because the accused has failed to contradict some aspect of the prosecution case  Further authority for the availability of the rule in Jones v Dunkel in civil penalty proceedings is found in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd     FCR     where Hill J stated at    Where the proceedings are criminal  and the present proceedings are not  they are proceedings  inter alia  for the recovery of a civil penalty  it might be thought that the failure of the accused to go into evidence should not lead to the drawing of Jones v Dunkel inferences  After all it is clear that a witness can not be compelled to give evidence which is likely to incriminate the witness or expose the witness to a penalty  However  even in criminal cases it has been held that the failure of the accused  who is in a position to deny  explain or answer the evidence adduced by the prosecution  to give evidence will permit the jury to draw inferences adverse to the accused more readily  see Azzopardi v R   HCA         ALR     affirming Weissensteiner v R   HCA         CLR    A fortiori  therefore  the failure of a respondent to proceedings for recovery of a pecuniary penalty to give evidence on a matter relevant to an issue in the proceeding and deny  explain or answer the evidence adduced against the respondent will permit the Court more readily to draw the inferences to which the decision in Jones v Dunkel refers  In Council of the New South Wales Bar Association v Power   NSWCA         NSWLR   at     a proceeding seeking removal of a legal practitioner from the Roll  Hodgson JA  with whom Beazley and McColl JJA agreed  referred to the High Court s conclusion in Azzopardi   HCA       CLR   that it was open to a trial judge in a criminal case to make a comment relating to the absence of evidence of additional facts peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused  Hodgson JA went on to say at   concerning the case before him that   If this had been a criminal trial  then in my opinion what the High Court said in Azzopardi would have meant that a jury could have been told that inferences from proved facts could more safely be drawn because the opponent elected not to give any explanation in terms of additional facts peculiarly within his knowledge or any evidence of such facts  In my opinion  if such Jones v Dunkel reasoning is available to a jury in a criminal trial  it must a fortiori be available to a court in civil proceedings such as the present  That would be so  even if these civil proceedings are regarded as proceedings for a civil penalty  I note that a similar view was expressed by Hill J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR   at    citedBateman v Slayter

This fourth category was recognised by McLelland J in Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd v G R Securities Pty Ltd     NSWLR   and on appeal in G R Securities Pty Ltd v Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd     NSWLR   where McHugh JA delivered the Court of Appeal s judgment and observed that the magnitude  subject matter or complexities of a transaction may indicate that an agreement was a limited one not intended to have legal effect  D  but that what was critical was the parties  intention objectively ascertained  and that this intention should prevail  E F   In Uranium Equities Ltd   WASCA       WAR     the Supreme Court of Western Australia  Court of Appeal  stated at   that the fourth Masters v Cameron category was a variation of the first category  The use of such expressions supports a finding of an intention to contract  In Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd v G R Securities Pty Ltd   NSWLR     McLelland J  in finding that by an exchange of letters the parties to an alleged agreement mutually communicated their respective assents to be legally bound by terms capable of having contractual effect  afforded the expression  legally binding  primacy despite the expression  agreement in principle  also found in the relevant agreement    His Honour thought that the case fell into the fourth category as recognised in Sinclair  Scott   Co   HCA       CLR    F    The appeal from McLelland J s judgment G R Securities v Baulkham Hills Private Hospital   NSWLR   was dismissed  McHugh JA accepted in line with Sinclair  Scott   Co   HCA       CLR     that it was possible for the parties to be bound immediately and agree to substitute for the first contract a further contract containing additional terms  G   Further  McHugh JA applied the general rule applicable to every contract explained by Mason J in Secured Income Real Estate  Australia  Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   that each party was obliged to do all

submits that one important aspect of this matter is the application of the principles found in Briginshaw v Briginshaw   HCA         CLR   to himself  He points to the seriousness of the allegations made by ASIC and the severity of the penalties it seeks in the form of large financial penalties and his disqualification from managing a corporation  He submits that these are more severe than many criminal punishments and would cause enormous harm to him and FMG  He says that  in these circumstances  the level of satisfaction that the Court requires to reach before accepting any of ASIC s contentions is as close to the criminal standard as could be in any civil proceeding  FMG also cited Briginshaw   HCA       CLR     saying that  because these are civil penalty proceedings  the Court should not lightly make findings of contraventions  even applying the balance of probabilities standard  given the seriousness of the causes of action and the gravity of the matters alleged and their consequences  FMG and Forrest are relying on the principle emerging from Dixon J s judgment in Briginshaw   CLR at     that in considering whether an allegation is made out to its  reasonable satisfaction  a tribunal should take into account the seriousness of the allegation and the gravity of the consequences that would follow if the allegation were to be accepted  In Qantas Airways Limited v Gama   FCAFC         FCR     French and Jacobson JJ stated at   that the  so called Briginshaw test  does not create any third standard of proof between the civil and the criminal  Their Honours said the standard of proof remains the same  that is proof on the balance of probabilities  and that the degree of satisfaction that is required in determining that that standard has been discharged may vary according to the seriousness of the allegations of misconduct that are made  Section   of the Evidence Act    Cth   the Evidence Act   prescribes the standard of proof in a civil proceeding as the balance of probabilities  and s   provides that the Court may take into account  in deciding whether it is so satisfied  the nature of the cause of action or defence  the nature of the subject matter of the proceeding and the gravity of the matters alleged  In Communications  Electrical  Electronic  Energy  Information  Postal  Plumbing   Allied Services Union of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCAFC         FCR   the Full Court noted at   that Dixon J s classic discussion in Briginshaw appositely expresses the considerations which s   of the Evidence Act now requires a court to take into account  Section   of the Act differs from s   of the Evidence Act in that it does not contain the  Briginshaw  considerations found in s   of the Evidence Act   However this does not require s   of the Evidence Act to be read down  In any event given that s  L requires the Court to apply the rules of evidence and procedure for civil matters when hearing proceedings for a declaration of contravention or a pecuniary penalty order  the considerations expressed in Dixon J s Briginshaw discussion are nevertheless relevant  In conclusion  the standard of proof that I must apply is the balance of probabilities as prescribed by s   and I accept that in deciding whether ASIC s allegations are made out on the balance of probabilities I am

summary of the propositions relevant to the application of s   emerging from the High Court s judgment in Campomar Sociedad  Dowsett J s summary  to which I have added references to the paragraphs of the High Court s judgment applicable to each proposition  is as follows  His Honour accepted that these observations are of general application in proceedings alleging contravention of s  H  of the Act     Conduct will only be misleading or deceptive  or likely to mislead or deceive if there is a nexus between such conduct and any actual or anticipated misconception or deception      In identifying such nexus regard must be had to the circumstances of the particular case  including the remedies sought  Section   of the TP Act does not confer any entitlement to a remedy for breach or anticipated breach  One must look elsewhere in the TP Act for such entitlement and construe the act as a whole      In some cases  a representation may be made to identified individuals  in other cases the representation may be to the public at large or to a section thereof  In the former case the process of deciding whether or not the representation is misleading or deceptive or likely to be so may be  direct and uncomplicated   In the latter case  the issue with respect to the sufficiency of the nexus between the conduct or the apprehended conduct and the misleading or deception or likely misleading or deception of prospective purchasers is to be approached at a level of abstraction not present where the case is one involving an express untrue representation allegedly made only to identified individuals    I infer that the word  representation  in   of Nike should be  misrepresentation  relying upon the relevant passage in Taco Bell to which the High Court was referring     When the representation is made to the public or to a section thereof  one must consider its effect upon an ordinary or reasonable member of the class in question  Although such class may include a wide range of persons  the ordinary or reasonable member will objectively be identified as having certain characteristics  In particular he or she can be expected to take reasonable care for his or her own interests and otherwise to behave reasonably      It is necessary to inquire as to how a particular or anticipated misconception has arisen or may arise  In so doing  the Court will consider  the effect of the relevant conduct on reasonable members of the class     Conduct will only be misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive if the representee  labours under some erroneous assumption  or may be expected so to labour  Such an assumption or anticipated assumption may be obvious  predictable or fanciful    In assessing the reactions or likely reactions of the ordinary or reasonable member of the class  the Court may decline to treat as reasonable  assumptions which are extreme or fanciful  The initial question which must be determined is whether the misconception or deception  alleged or anticipated  is properly attributable to an ordinary or reasonable member of the class      The  question whether particular conduct causes confusion or wonderment cannot be substituted for the question whether the conduct answers the statutory description contained in s      However  where there is a finding of intention to deceive  the court may more readily infer that the intention has been or in all probability will be effective  Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Pub Squash Co Pty Ltd     NSWLR   at   S   I Publishing Pty Ltd v Australian Surf Life Saver Pty Ltd   FCA

formulation of a more comprehensive and detailed Joint Venture Agreement      The Court of Appeal  Kirby P  Handley JA and Waddell A JA  held that the statement was not binding as a contractual promise  Kirby P  with whom Waddell A JA agreed  held at p   that the promise  having regard to the context in which it was made  should be classified as too illusory or too vague and uncertain to be enforceable  Handley JA held at pp     that a promise to negotiate in good faith is illusory and therefore cannot be binding because there are no identifiable criteria by which the content of the obligation to negotiate in good faith can be determined  Jobern   FCA   involved a contractual dispute where the parties had executed a document entitled  Heads of Agreement   HofA  clause     of which stated   Each party will conduct all such negotiations in good faith to ensure that the terms set out in these Heads of Agreement are given full effect   It was not in dispute in Jobern that the parties were bound by the HoFA  which Gordon J stated to be a final agreement within the first category described in Masters v Cameron   HCA       CLR   at     However Gordon J considered that cl     was uncertain because it suffered from the same problems referred to by Kirby J in Coal Cliff Collieries   NSWLR   at    In my view Coal Cliff Collieries   NSWLR   Jobern   FCA   and Walford     AC   do not assist ASIC  I do not take Coal Cliff Collieries as authority for the proposition that a bare agreement to negotiate in good faith is not enforceable  as submitted by ASIC  In my view  that case is authority for the proposition that a promise to negotiate in good faith may  in particular circumstances  be enforceable  depending on the precise terms as construed from the contract  In Jobern   FCA     it was not in dispute that the heads of agreement document was binding only the negotiation clause was held to be uncertain  In Walford     AC     the agreement that was found to be

at   that there is no reason in civil proceedings for pecuniary penalties to deny the applicability of the principles in Jones v Dunkel provided that in doing so the court proceeds in accordance with the principles in relation to s   of the Evidence Act   which prescribes he civil standard as the applicable standard of proof  I have discussed the standard of proof earlier referred toCouncil of the New South Wales Bar Association v Power   NSWCA         NSWLR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  htmlIn Council of the New South Wales Bar Association v Power   NSWCA         NSWLR   at     a proceeding seeking removal of a legal practitioner from the Roll  Hodgson JA  with whom Beazley and McColl JJA agreed  referred to the High Court s conclusion in Azzopardi   HCA       CLR   that it was open to a trial judge in a criminal case to make a comment relating to the absence of evidence of additional facts peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused  Hodgson JA went on to say at   concerning the case before him that   If this had been a criminal trial  then in my opinion what the High Court said in Azzopardi would have meant that a jury could have been told that inferences from proved facts could more safely be drawn because the opponent elected not to give any explanation in terms of additional facts peculiarly within his knowledge or any evidence of such facts  In my opinion  if such Jones v Dunkel reasoning is available to a jury in a criminal trial  it must a fortiori be available to a court in civil proceedings such as the present  That would be so  even if these civil proceedings are regarded as proceedings for a civil penalty  I note that a similar view was expressed by Hill J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR   at    consideredDyers v The Queen   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlFMG made no submissions on whether Jones v Dunkel had any application  Citing Dyers v The Queen   HCA         CLR     Forrest submitted in written closing submissions that a Jones v Dunkel inference may not be drawn against an accused in a criminal case because the application of the rule in Jones v Dunkel is incompatible with the presumption of innocence and the rights of the accused  further  this reasoning applies with equal force to the accused calling other persons to give evidence  Forrest then submitted that the point of principle that  when an accused exercises the right not to give evidence the jury is directed that no adverse inference should be drawn  applies to a civil proceeding as against an individual defendant  He referred to the statement of Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne  and Heydon JJ in Rich v Australian Securities and Investment Commission   HCA         CLR   at   that the privilege against exposure to penalty serves the purpose of ensuring that those who allege criminality or other  illegal  conduct should prove it  and said there is no expectation that a defendant will give evidence on matters for which the plaintiff bears the onus of proof  He said there is no authority that supports the proposition that a Jones v Dunkel inference is available against an individual defendant in a civil penalty proceeding  though  he said  the position may be different for a company  Finally  Forrest submitted that inferences are to be drawn from the documents before considering any question of Jones v Dunkel   and a Jones v Dunkel inference is not be used in determining what inference ought to be drawn from the documents  citing Singh v Minister for Immigration   FCA         FCR   at     In RPS   HCA       CLR     Azzopardi v The Queen   HCA         CLR   and Dyers   HCA       CLR     the High Court considered the applicability of the rule in Jones v Dunkel to criminal proceedings  It decided that the rule is of very limited application to defendants in criminal cases  its reasoning based on the accusatorial nature of criminal proceedings  As an illustration of the Court s approach  in Dyers   Gaudron and Hayne JJ stated at    As was pointed out in RPS      it will seldom  if ever  be reasonable to conclude that an accused in a criminal trial would be expected to give evidence  Not only is the accused not bound to give evidence  it is for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt  The mode of reasoning which is spoken of in     Jones v Dunkel   ordinarily  therefore  cannot be applied to a defendant in a criminal trial  That mode of reasoning depends upon a premise that the person concerned not only could shed light on the subject but also would ordinarily be expected to do so  The conclusion that an accused could shed light on the subject matter of the charge is a conclusion that would ordinarily be reached very easily  But given the accusatorial nature of a criminal trial  it cannot be said that  in such a proceeding  the accused would ordinarily be expected to give evidence  So to hold would be to deny that it is for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt  That is why the majority of the Court concluded  in RPS and in Azzopardi   that it is ordinarily inappropriate to tell the jury that some inference can be drawn from the fact that the accused has not given evidence  Further  in my view  nothing that has been said by the High Court in Dyers   HCA       CLR   and the other authorities discussed above supports the proposition that the general rule proscribing the making of inferences from a defendant s failure to give evidence in criminal proceedings should be extended to civil penalty proceedings in the form of a prohibition against applying the rule in Jones v Dunkel   notwithstanding that pursuant to Rich s  L also obliges the court to apply the body of law which has developed in relation to the privileges against penalties and forfeitures when deciding whether an order for discovery should be made citedEx parte Dawes  in re Moon     QBD  Authority supports an argument that the agreement recorded in the recitals for CREC to build or  execute  the railway should be given effect and should be treated as an agreement between FMG and CREC even where the operative provisions of the framework agreement do not contain such a provision and there is nothing inconsistent with such a construction in the operative provisions  Buckland v Buckland     Ch   at     MacKenzie v Childers     Ch D   at             Ex parte Dawes  in re Moon     QBD                 Aspdin v Austin     QB   at    This

included a clause containing an elaborate mechanism for the determination of the purchase price of the assets and goodwill of a deceased partner  with the price to be fixed by a valuer  Underwood J held at   that the rule imposed on the valuers for the ascertainment of the value of the goodwill was completely meaningless by virtue of the omission of a dollar figure from a particular subparagraph of the clause  Underwood J stated that the rule that had to be applied for the ascertainment of the value of the goodwill was incomplete in just the same way as if a contract specified that  the purchase price of the goods sold is    Accordingly  the uncertainty created by this omission rendered the whole contract void for uncertainty  Underwood J went on in that paragraph to state   It is

in the framework agreements is arguably certain for reasons I will explain below referred toFletcher Challenge Energy Ltd v Electricity Corporation of New Zealand Ltd     NZLR  I have concluded  for reasons which I explain later in this Part that  in the case of each of the framework agreements  there was an intention to contract  This  as a starting point considerably strengthens the case for

difference arising on the subject matter or construction of the agreement  Scrutton LJ agreed at p   that there was an effective and enforceable contract  although as to the future no definite price

think that a statement is necessarily misleading or deceptive if it cannot be demonstrated to be correct beyond any doubt  Nor is it necessarily misleading or deceptive merely if it is not accompanied by words indicating that a contrary view is held by others  If it were otherwise  public discussion and the free expression of opinions would be greatly inhibited  This would especially be the case where the statement is one of opinion or of mixed fact and opinion  When such a statement is made  the person to whom it is addressed will  in most cases  understand that there may be room for another opinion on the same matter  Where that is the case  I find it difficult to characterize the statement as being misleading or deceptive  The position would be different  of course  when a statement of opinion is made by a person who does not  in fact  hold that opinion  It might be thought that the disclosures  to the effect that FMG had executed binding build and transfer agreements with each of the Chinese Contractors  ought be characterised as statements of fact rather than opinion  Certainly  they were assertive in nature and were not expressly said to be expressions of opinion  However  I consider that they constitute mixed fact and law  As an objective matter  an assertion as to the meaning and legal effect of an agreement is necessarily the product of an opinion formulated to that effect  However the disclosures are characterised  a question as to the reasonableness of the underlying opinion and  in this case  whether or not it was honestly held  arises consideredGodecke v

at    There is some overlap between the requirements of intention to create legal relations and certainty  If a contract is legally uncertain  this might indicate that the parties did not intend to

what is postponed is essential to the agreement  itself a question that largely depends upon the intention of the parties    the agreement  to the extent that it has been reached  will be void  Also

TASSC   at     and Southern Cross Financial Group  Newcastle  Pty Ltd v Rodrigues     IPR   at      The judgment of the High Court in Hall v Busst   CLR   illustrates how judges have disagreed as to the enforceability of a contractual clause dealing with the issue of price  where the clause leaves an aspect of the price for determination at a later time  This judgment is in relative terms an old decision  but the High Court was divided     which underscores the difficulty in construing such clauses and in a case such as the present case the unfairness which would attach to fixing on one opinion over others where those others were reasonably based and honestly held  The dispute involved a contract of sale in relation to an island off the coast of Queensland  The contract included an indenture which included an option which was in effect  in the words of Dixon CJ at   an option for the buyer of the land to take the land back with a refund of the sale price payment for the additions and improvements at their value less deficiences and depreciation  The clause referred to  the value of all additions and improvements to the said property  and  the value of all deficiences of chattel property and a reasonable sum to cover depreciation of all buildings and other property   The appeal to the High Court was brought on the ground that the price payable on the exercise of the option under the indenture was prescribed or expressed in terms which left it uncertain so that the option was unenforceable  Dixon CJ held at   that the price described in the relevant clause was unascertained and was too uncertain to be the basis of an enforceable contract  His Honour said   There could be no external standard of value of additions and improvements to the island  no standard yielding a figure reasonable fixed or ascertainable  Still less would it be possible to find an external standard for the reasonable sum to cover depreciation even if one knew what  other property  is referred to  Fullagar J also held that the clause was uncertain because the price was not fixed with certainty  However  his Honour stated   that it would be sufficient if the sale was expressed to be for a price or value to be fixed by a named or described person  It was not sufficient for the sale to be expressed to be  for the value of the land  or  for the fair value of the land  or  for a reasonable price   Menzies J took a similar view  stating that no means of authoritative determination was provided by the agreement  and the necessity for further agreement revealed that there was no binding contract    Kitto J dissented stating that the meaning of the clause providing for additions and subtractions to the price did not seem to be uncertain  and that the value of the additions  improvements and deficiencies were capable of being ascertained when the time arrived  The provision as to  a reasonable sum to cover depreciation  appeared to his Honour to be definite in meaning and capable of being rendered certain in application  and he referred to a number of authorities  Windeyer J also dissented  saying that the parties expressed their intention in language that was sufficiently certain to create legal obligations  His Honour stated  following reference to a range of authorities    When parties agree to sell for a reasonable price or at a fair valuation they do not leave an essential term of their bargain for further agreement  so that their agreement is incomplete  It is complete  They have fixed the price by a measure that the law knows  If they disagree as to what sum of money fills that measure  a court will determine it  at common law by a jury  Faulkner v Thomas   TASSC   concerned a partnership agreement which included a clause containing an elaborate mechanism for the determination of the purchase price of the assets and goodwill of a deceased partner  with the price to be fixed by a valuer  Underwood J held at   that the rule imposed on the valuers for the ascertainment of the value of the goodwill was completely meaningless by virtue of the omission of a dollar figure from a particular subparagraph of the clause  Underwood J stated that the rule that had to be applied for the ascertainment of the value of the goodwill was incomplete in just the same way as if a contract specified that  the purchase price of the goods sold is    Accordingly  the uncertainty created by this omission rendered the whole contract void for uncertainty  Underwood J went on in that paragraph to state   It is not for the Court to supply the omission upon some notions of general fairness  and cited Hall v Busst as authority for that proposition  In the present matter  my view is that the pricing mechanism in the framework agreements is arguably certain for reasons I will explain below  In Southern Cross Financial Group   IPR     Young CJ in Eq stated at   that in a contract for the sale of any article there are at least three basic requirements  precise identification of the parties to the contract  the property to be sold  and the price at which it is to be sold  In connection with the price requirement  his Honour referred to the analysis of Fullagar J in Hall v Busst   CLR at   and stated at   that this analysis made it quite clear that with  very  very  very few  exceptions  a contract to sell property at fair value is not binding and is incomplete  The exceptions included  an industry which has a measure of what a fair value is or there is some other criteria   I would add that Fullagar J stated at   that it would be sufficient if the sale was expressed to be for a price or value to be fixed by a named or described person  The CREC Framework Agreement did not simply state that the infrastructure items would be transferred at fair value or in like terms  Rather  the agreement expressly provided a pricing mechanism  Further  Southern Cross Financial Group   IPR   is distinguishable from the present matter

given full effect   It was not in dispute in Jobern that the parties were bound by the HoFA  which Gordon J stated to be a final agreement within the first category described in Masters v Cameron   HCA       CLR   at     However Gordon J considered that cl     was uncertain because it suffered from the same problems referred to by Kirby J in Coal Cliff Collieries   NSWLR   at    In my view Coal Cliff Collieries   NSWLR   Jobern   FCA   and Walford     AC   do not assist ASIC  I do not take Coal Cliff Collieries as authority for the proposition that a bare agreement to negotiate in good faith is not enforceable  as submitted by ASIC  In my view  that case is authority for the proposition that a promise to negotiate in good faith may  in particular circumstances  be enforceable  depending on the precise terms as construed from the contract  In Jobern   FCA     it was not in dispute that the heads of agreement document was binding only the negotiation clause was held to be uncertain  In

that ASIC s allegations against FMG and Forrest are serious  In addition  I accept that the penalties sought against both would have severe consequences  Any monetary penalties against FMG and Forrest

foreshadowed that it would call evidence from its executives  such as Rowley  David Liu and Alan Watling but it did not do so  ASIC submits that  where an inference is open from facts proved  the unexplained failure of a party to call a witness or tender a document may be taken into account as a circumstance in favour of the drawing inference  Jones v Dunkel   HCA         CLR   at     and     RPS v The Queen   HCA         CLR   at     ASIC submits that it should be inferred that Rowley  Liu and Watling were available to be called  but FMG chose not to call them for strategic reasons  As a result  ASIC says  if there are inferences to be drawn from documents in evidence  which could have been explained by these executives  or by Forrest who also elected not to give evidence  the inference should be drawn against FMG that the evidence of these executives would have been of no assistance to their case  and that the documents should bear the meaning contended for by ASIC  FMG made no submissions on whether Jones v Dunkel had any application  Citing Dyers v The Queen   HCA         CLR     Forrest submitted in written closing submissions that a Jones v Dunkel inference may not be drawn against an accused in a criminal case because the application of the rule in Jones v Dunkel is incompatible with the presumption of innocence and the rights of the accused  further  this

evidence the jury is directed that no adverse inference should be drawn  applies to a civil proceeding as against an individual defendant  He referred to the statement of Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne  and Heydon JJ in Rich v Australian Securities and Investment Commission   HCA         CLR   at   that the privilege against exposure to penalty serves the purpose of ensuring that those who allege criminality or other  illegal  conduct should prove it  and said there is no expectation that a defendant will give evidence on matters for which the plaintiff bears the onus of proof  He said there is no authority that supports the proposition that a Jones v Dunkel inference is available against an individual defendant in a civil penalty proceeding  though  he said  the position may be different for a company  Finally  Forrest submitted that inferences are to be drawn from the documents before considering any question of Jones v Dunkel   and a Jones v Dunkel inference is not be used in determining what inference ought to be drawn from the documents  citing Singh v Minister for Immigration   FCA         FCR   at     In RPS   HCA       CLR     Azzopardi v The Queen   HCA         CLR   and Dyers   HCA       CLR     the High Court considered the applicability of the rule in Jones v Dunkel to criminal proceedings  It decided that the rule is of very limited application to defendants in criminal cases  its reasoning based on the accusatorial nature of criminal proceedings  As an illustration of the Court s approach  in Dyers   Gaudron and Hayne JJ stated at    As was pointed out in RPS      it will seldom  if ever  be reasonable to conclude that an accused in a criminal trial would be expected to give evidence  Not only is the accused not bound to give evidence  it is for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt  The mode of reasoning which is spoken of in     Jones v Dunkel   ordinarily  therefore  cannot be applied to a defendant in a criminal trial  That mode of reasoning depends upon a premise that the person concerned not only could shed light on the subject but also would ordinarily be expected to do so  The conclusion that an accused could shed light on the subject matter of the charge is a conclusion that would ordinarily be reached very easily  But given the accusatorial nature of a criminal trial  it cannot be said that  in such a proceeding  the accused would ordinarily be expected to give evidence  So to hold would be to deny that it is for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt  That is why the majority of the Court concluded  in RPS and in Azzopardi   that it is ordinarily inappropriate to tell the jury that some inference can be drawn from the fact that the accused has not given evidence  In RPS   HCA       CLR     at     Gaudron A CJ  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ contrasted the reasonable expectation that a party in a civil trial would give or call relevant evidence in the circumstances described in Jones v Dunkel with the conclusion that it would seldom  if ever  be reasonable to expect an accused in a criminal trial to give evidence  Weissensteiner provides an example of where the latter would be reasonable  The Rich cases therefore turned on the issue of whether a disqualification order was a penalty  It was not in dispute that the privilege against exposure to penalty protected a defendant in civil proceedings not only from being obliged to give discovery  but also from being subject to any direction that affidavits or witness statements be provided to the plaintiff prior to the hearing or at any time prior to the conclusion of the plaintiff s case  see e g  Austin J at first instance    NSWSC         ACLC     at      In their judgments  neither the High Court nor the Court of Appeal considered the application of the rule in Jones v Dunkel   Austin J mentioned it briefly in passing at    The rule in Jones v Dunkel was discussed however in Adler v Australian Securities   Investments Commission   NSWCA         FLR     Williams v Australian Securities   Investments Commission   NSWCA         ACSR     a judgment handed down before the High Court s Rich ruling  where the New South Wales Court of Appeal ruled that the trial judge  Santow J     NSWSC       ACSR     made no error in so far as his findings against Mr Adler  his company and Mr Williams were aided by Jones v Dunkel inferences against both those individuals and the company  In that proceeding ASIC had sought  inter alia   disqualification orders as well as pecuniary penalties  Giles JA  with whom Mason P and Beazley JA agreed  considered the High Court criminal cases discussed above and noted at   that proceedings for civil penalties do not share the same fundamental features of a criminal trial  His Honour stated that civil penalty proceedings are expressly to be maintained by civil law processes  not by a criminal trial with its fundamental features     He concluded that it was open for Jones v Dunkel inferences to be drawn against Mr Adler  his company  and Mr Williams in the proceedings     The rulings in Adler were therefore made on the footing that the privilege against exposure to penalty was attracted through ASIC s seeking of pecuniary penalties  but this did not prevent the trial judge from applying the rule in Jones v Dunkel  the rule and privilege both falling within the rules of evidence and procedure for civil matters that the court was bound to apply pursuant to s  L of the act when hearing proceedings for a declaration of contravention or a pecuniary penalty order  The High Court refused an application for special leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal s decision in Adler     HCATrans       May    The transcript reveals that the special leave point argued was the issue of procedural fairness in dealing with the imposition of pecuniary penalties and disqualification under the civil penalties regime of the Act  there was no discussion of the rule in Jones v Dunkel   Further  in my view  nothing that has been said by the High Court in Dyers   HCA       CLR   and the other authorities discussed above supports the proposition that the general rule proscribing the making of inferences from a defendant s failure to give evidence in criminal proceedings should be extended to civil penalty proceedings in the form of a prohibition against applying the rule in Jones v Dunkel   notwithstanding that pursuant to Rich s  L also obliges the court to apply the body of law which has developed in relation to the privileges against penalties and forfeitures when deciding whether an order for discovery should be made  Further authority for the availability of the rule in Jones v Dunkel in civil penalty proceedings is found in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd     FCR     where Hill J stated at    Where the proceedings are criminal  and the present proceedings are not  they are proceedings  inter alia  for the recovery of a civil penalty  it might be thought that the failure of the accused to go into evidence should not lead to the drawing of Jones v Dunkel inferences  After all it is clear that a witness can not be compelled to give evidence which is likely to incriminate the witness or expose the witness to a penalty  However  even in criminal cases it has been held that the failure of the accused  who is in a position to deny  explain or answer the evidence adduced by the prosecution  to give evidence will permit the jury to draw inferences adverse to the accused more readily  see Azzopardi v R   HCA         ALR     affirming Weissensteiner v R   HCA         CLR    A fortiori  therefore  the failure of a respondent to proceedings for recovery of a pecuniary penalty to give evidence on a matter relevant to an issue in the proceeding and deny  explain or answer the evidence adduced against the respondent will permit the Court more readily to draw the inferences to which the decision in Jones v Dunkel refers  In Council of the New South Wales Bar Association v Power   NSWCA         NSWLR   at     a proceeding seeking removal of a legal practitioner from the Roll  Hodgson JA  with whom Beazley and McColl JJA agreed  referred to the High Court s conclusion in Azzopardi   HCA       CLR   that it was open to a trial judge in a criminal case to make a comment relating to the absence of evidence of additional facts peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused  Hodgson JA went on to say at   concerning the case before him that   If this had been a criminal trial  then in my opinion what the High Court said in Azzopardi would have meant that a jury could have been told that inferences from proved facts could more safely be drawn because the opponent elected not to give any explanation in terms of additional facts peculiarly within his knowledge or any evidence of such facts  In my opinion  if such Jones v Dunkel reasoning is available to a jury in a criminal trial  it must a fortiori be available to a court in civil proceedings such as the present  That would be so  even if these civil proceedings are regarded as proceedings for a civil penalty  I note that a similar view was expressed by Hill J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR   at     In Communications  Electrical  Electronic  Energy  Information  Postal  Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCAFC         FCR     the Court discussed the Adler and Rich cases and concluded at   that there is no reason in civil proceedings for pecuniary penalties to deny the applicability of the principles in Jones v Dunkel provided that in doing so the court proceeds in accordance with the principles in relation to s   of the Evidence Act   which prescribes he civil standard as the applicable standard of proof  I have discussed the standard of proof earlier  Finally  in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich   NSWSC   Austin J concluded at   that  having considered the reasoning in Dyers and Adler   the principle in Jones v Dunkel is applicable against either party to civil penalty proceedings  ASIC seeks to draw Jones v Dunkel inferences against FMG by reason of the failure of Forrest and the other executives to give evidence  ASIC does not seek to draw the inferences against Forrest himself  Forrest has relied on the privilege against self incrimination and the privilege against exposure to penalty  privileges which are are not available to corporations  Trade Practices Commission v Abbco Ice Works Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR    However  even if ASIC had sought to draw inferences against Forrest as well as the corporate entity  on my review of the authorities it would not have been precluded from doing so  There is no reason therefore  in these circumstances  why the inferences cannot  as a matter of law  be drawn against FMG in the present proceedings  The question which then arises is whether I should draw such an inference in the manner urged by ASIC The authorities state that two inferences are involved in the rule in Jones v Dunkel   First  a court might infer that the evidence of the absent witness would not have assisted the party that failed to call that witness  secondly  a court might draw  with greater confidence  any inference unfavourable to the party that failed to call that witness  if that witness appears to be in a position to cast light on whether the inference should be drawn  Manly Council v Byrne and Anor   NSWCA   at     ASIC v Macdonald   NSWSC       ALR   per Gzell J at    In Manly Council   the Court of Appeal stated that there is no compulsion on the trial judge to draw either of the Jones v Dunkel inferences  This was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in Howell v Macquarie University   NSWCA   at       where Campbell JA said  with the agreement of Spigelman CJ and Bell JA  as her Honour then was   In other words  in a civil trial by judge alone Jones v Dunkel licences  but does not compel  the drawing of inferences when a witness is not called  Whether either or both of the inferences are actually drawn is part of the trial judge s task of weighing the evidence  Further  the Court of Appeal in Manly Council referred to the principles concerning the application of Jones v Dunkel set out by Glass JA in Payne v Parker     NSWLR   at     which have been widely regarded as correct although Glass JA was in dissent as to the application of the principles to the facts  per Campbell JA with whom Beazley JA and Pearlman AJA agreed  at    In Payne     NSWLR     Glass JA said that whether Jones v Dunkel should be applied depends on establishing three conditions   a  the missing witness would be expected to be called by one party rather than the other       b  his evidence would elucidate a particular matter       c  his absence is unexplained  Before stating my conclusion on whether I ought to make any Jones v Dunkel inferences  I will deal with the final authority cited by Forrest  Singh v Minister for Immigration   FCA         FCR     from which he submits the following propositions emerge  that inferences are to be drawn from the documents before considering any question of Jones v Dunkel   and that a Jones v Dunkel inference is not to be used in determining what inference ought to be drawn from the documents  In Singh   the applicant sought judicial review of a Ministerial decision to refuse to grant a spouse visa on character grounds  The Minister s reasons for decision were given in two documents  a decision record and a statement of reasons  The applicant argued that the Minister erred in making his decision by failing to have regard to the character references in support of the applicant which were annexed to a letter attached to the decision record  The Minister did not give evidence at trial  but Sackville J found that the statement of reasons provided affirmative evidence that the Minister gave consideration to the contents of the character references  The inferences that the applicant sought to draw by the Minister s failure to give evidence were contradicted by the Minister s statement of reasons  In my view  what Sackville J said in Singh concerning the application of the Jones v Dunkel principle to the case before him is merely an application of the second condition given by Glass JA in Payne at p   as to whether the principle can or should be applied  namely whether the evidence of the missing witness would elucidate a particular matter  There was no occasion to draw an inference from the Minister s failure to give evidence because in his Honour s view  the question of whether he took into account the character references was adequately addressed by the statement of reasons  As ASIC s senior counsel put it  in ASIC s closing written submissions  generally  the evidence upon which ASIC relies to establish all of the alleged contraventions is documentary  and founded upon FMG s own business records  This evidence is supplemented by certain alleged admissions by Watling and Rowley  derived from transcripts of examinations conducted by ASIC pursuant to s   of the ASIC Act   ASIC s closing submissions      ASIC withdrew from tender alleged admissions made by Forrest during his s   examination  This was so despite the fact that Forrest who had not claimed privilege  as he might have done during his examination sought to have additional parts of his transcript admitted which he said would put in context and explained what ASIC contended amounted to admissions against Forrest s interest  The additional evidence  I infer  would have been favourable to Forrest  If ASIC considered that  despite this additional evidence  the transcript nonetheless disclosed relevant admissions then it would  no doubt  have persisted with its tender  However  I was denied the benefit of any of this evidence  ASIC has not identified any particular matters that the evidence of the executives  including Forrest  would elucidate  For these reasons  I decline to make any Jones v Dunkel inference against FMG from the failure of Forrest and the other executives to give evidence  Browne v Dunn ASIC submits there is also a small amount of direct evidence from witnesses it called which mostly went unchallenged  For example  Catherine Li  a former FMG engineer  was not cross examined about her evidence concerning a meeting on   November in which Forrest offered a   equity interest in the Project to a Chinese investor  Likewise  Wei Fisher  a former FMG executive assistant  was not cross examined about her evidence of a letter from CMCC on about   February   in which she recalls that CMCC claimed that the  deal  with the Chinese contractors was off  FMG s honesty in this respect depends on that of Forrest and other members of its board  That FMG s opinion was genuine may be inferred from other facts  For reasons contained under Part   I draw no Jones v Dunkel inference against Forrest by reason of him not giving evidence  It is instructive to consider the following   a  legal oversight and advice     b  the position adopted by the Chinese Contractors     c  FMG s internal records     d  FMG s external communications     e  the position adopted by FMG executives   f  Advanced framework agreements     g  comparison with other FMG documents      Legal oversight and advice ASIC  in respect to its case under s   pleads at ASC   amongst other things  that FMG by its board  including Forrest  ought to have come into possession of the parts of the Informations concerning  on ASIC s case  the legal effect of the framework agreements by first obtaining competent legal advice as to the legal effect of the framework agreements consideredJubilee Mines NL v Riley     ALR  There is an apparent distinction between Listing Rule     which requires that the information be expected to have a  material  effect on the price or value of the securities and the deeming provision in s   of the Act which requires only that the information would or would be likely to  influence  common investors  This was considered by the Court of Appeal of Western Australia in Jubilee Mines NL v Riley     ALR   in respect of equivalent provisions in the continuous disclosure provisions in the Corporations Law and the ASX Listing Rules  In Jubilee Mines   ALR   the provisions of the Act relating to continuous disclosure were at that time located in Chapter   Part     Div    They were relocated to Chapter  CA by the Financial Services Reform Act     The relevant continuous disclosure Listing Rule was Rule  A  the equivalent of that Rule is now Rule      The equivalent of s   s   and s   that were considered are s  A  s  B and s  D respectively  In Jubilee Mines   ALR   the issue was whether Jubilee  a small listed gold exploration company that wanted to transition into a gold producing company had to disclose information that it received  in   of drilling results about the nickel development potential of its tenements  on receiving that information from a neighbouring tenement holder Western Mining Corporation Ltd  which had inadvertently conducted drilling on Jubilee s tenements  When such information was released in   there was a resultant increase in Jubilee s share price  But  in   Jubilee was focussed on gold and was short of cash  without the necessary ability to develop any nickel assets  The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from a judgment of a master of the Supreme Court  and held that there had been no contravention of s  A essentially because the information was held to be not material in    Martin CJ delivered the main judgment with which Le Miere AJA agreed  McLure JA delivered a separate judgment  Martin CJ rejected the argument that the Listing Rule can only be contravened if a reasonable person would expect the information to have a material effect on the price or value of a company s securities quite independently of the question posed by s  D  His Honour said the better view is that s  D applies to the Listing Rule  with the consequence that if information has the characteristic defined in that section  it should be taken to be information falling within the scope of the Listing Rule         This was for the reason that acceptance of the argument would create an inconsistency between the Listing Rule on the one hand and ss  A and  D on the other  which would not have been intended by Parliament  The inconsistency would be that the Listing Rule would require notification only when there was a reasonably expected material impact on share price or value  whilst ss  A and  D would require notification whenever the information would  or would be likely to influence common investors       In a separate judgment  McLure JA considered whether s  D supplants the third element of the Listing Rule  namely materiality and concluded that because s  D was stated to apply for the purposes of s  A and s  B but not the Listing Rule  and because s  A and s  B apply only if information is not generally available  unlike the Listing Rule  which applies regardless  s  D did not describe materiality for the purposes of the Listing Rule       At   McLure JA also referred to the  obvious terminological differences  between the tests in s  D and the Listing Rule  Her Honour stated that the test in s  D does not rely on a hypothetical reasonable person and does not require a material effect on the price of securities  However  in the circumstances of the case  her Honour held it was unnecessary to determine whether the differences are capable of producing different outcomes  because the concession of the parties that the price of shares in the relevant company were determined by the conduct and motivations of share traders would apply to both tests and the outcome would have been the same  On   July   the High Court refused application for special leave to appeal the Court of Appeal s decision  In my opinion  in substance  the approach adopted by the majority is correct  It is a matter of the proper construction of Listing Rule      I would construe  information  which  would  or would be likely to influence  common investors in deciding whether to acquire or dispose of securities as information  for the purposes of Listing Rule     that a reasonable person would expect to have a material effect on the price or value of the securities  This is merely an approach to the construction of the words  material effect on the price or value of the entity s securities  in Listing Rule     which provides harmony with the provisions of ss   and   of the Act  Paragraph   of Guidance Note   to Listing Rule     which refers to s   and s   supports this construction  The relevant requirements of Listing Rule     and s  c  as applicable to FMG at the time it made the notifications to the ASX in August and November   were as follows   a  there must have existed  information  within the meaning of Listing Rule     and s      b  FMG must have been aware of that information  s  b  Listing Rule        c  that information must not have been generally available  s  c i  cf Listing Rule    A   and      d  a reasonable person would have expected that information to have had a material effect on the price or value of FMG s shares  if it had been generally available  s  c ii  Listing Rule          The meaning and operation of the last two requirements is governed by ss   and s   respectively  I find support  in my approach to the issue of opinion  in the context of Listing Rule     from the judgment of McLure JA in Jubilee Mines   ALR    This case involved competing opinions as to the significance of geological information  the WMC information  supplied to Jubilee  Jubilee had obtained an expert opinion from a geologist  Mr Cooke  who was also an executive of Jubilee  In light of his opinion  Jubilee s managing director decided there was no need to disclose the information to the ASX  The respondent s expert opinion given at trial was to the contrary  McLure JA observed at   that expert opinions held in good faith on reasonable grounds may differ  Her Honour also stated at    However  the fact that there are competing expert opinions on the level of significance of the WMC information does not justify a conclusion that the appellant ought to have been aware that the WMC information was highly significant  No doubt if Mr Cooke s assessment was negligent  not based on reasonable grounds  there may be room for such a finding  However  I see no basis in the evidence for a finding that Mr Cooke s opinion was other than honestly held on reasonable grounds  Subsequent drilling results do not support a finding that Mr Cooke s   assessment was unreasonable      Were ASIC s opinions as to the legal effect of the framework agreements self evident having regard to their terms ASIC s case is that the opinions  in effect  expressed in the Informations were obvious and the only opinions reasonably open objectively  I say opinions  because even on ASIC s case there are competing opinions  First ASIC submits that the framework agreements have no legal effect and are therefore unenforceable  Second ASIC submits that if they are enforceable they are merely agreements to enter into negotiations  It follows that ASIC s contention necessarily extends to a submission that FMG s opinion as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreement  in effect contained in the disclosures opinion was not reasonably open  I accept however that evidence of the actual effect of the information actually disclosed on FMG s share price may be relevant to assist the Court in its determination of whether s   has been contravened  Rivkin Financial Services Ltd v Sofcom Ltd     ACSR   by analogy at     Jubilee Mines NL v Riley     ALR   at     and    This involves an ex post inquiry   Such evidence may constitute a relevant cross check as to the reasonableness of an ex ante judgment about a different hypothetical disclosure  Gzell J in ASIC v Macdonald  No     ALR at   said   Where likelihood of the occurrence of an event is in issue and relevant facts are available  they are to be preferred to prophecies citedMacKenzie v Childers     Ch D  Authority supports an argument that the agreement recorded in the recitals for CREC to build or  execute  the railway should be given effect and should be treated as an agreement between FMG and CREC even where the operative provisions of the framework agreement do not contain such a provision and there is nothing inconsistent with such a construction in the operative provisions  Buckland v Buckland     Ch   at     MacKenzie v Childers     Ch D   at             Ex parte Dawes  in re Moon     QBD                 Aspdin v Austin     QB   at    This is even more so where  as here  the framework agreements were not drawn by lawyers  They were drafted by Heyting  an engineer  who also holds a Masters of Business Administration and who had some training in contract management  In those circumstances  arguably  a distinction between recitals and operational clauses should not be rigorously applied in an attempt to determine the parties  intention  determined objectively  Expressly  the recitals proceed on the basis that there is an agreement for the relevant Chinese contractor to build the infrastructure which is sought to be recorded in the framework agreements  The recitals do not say or imply that what follows is merely an informal arrangement

Cameron   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlForrest submits that the agreement falls under the first category of agreement identified in Masters v Cameron   HCA       CLR   such that the parties have agreed all terms and intend to be bound immediately but propose  to have the terms restated in a form which will be fuller or more precise but not different in effect   Like FMG  Forrest submits that the agreement was a binding first agreement for the build  finance and transfer of the railway  with a further agreement to be executed at a later date  ASIC submits  however  that the most noteworthy aspect of the agreement is the absence of agreement on critical matters  and the complete absence of detail about other matters  ASIC makes the following submissions regarding the terms of the CREC Framework Agreement in support of its contentions that the agreement was a bare agreement to negotiate the scope and terms of a further contract to build  transfer and finance the infrastructure  and that it did not impose any legally enforceable obligations   a  CREC was not obliged to actually build or transfer the railway     b  there was no agreed price in the agreement nor any mechanism to achieve or confirm a price     c  there was no definition of the scope of the works to be performed     d  there was no provision for choice of contractors or the selection of materials     e  there was no definition of  practical completion     f  there were no specifications for any design elements of the infrastructure       I will deal with each of these in turn    Was CREC arguably obliged to actually build or transfer the railway In Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games   NSWLR   Gleeson CJ  with whom Hope and Mahoney JJA agreed  confirmed at  E F the importance in a Masters v Cameron type of dispute of assessing the parties  intention to make a concluded bargain  and stated that the question of intention is distinct from  although it may be closely related to  the question whether the parties have reached agreement upon such terms as are  in the circumstances  legally necessary to constitute a contract  His Honour stated   Nevertheless  in the ordinary case  as a matter of fact and commonsense other things being equal  the more numerous and significant the areas in respect of which the parties have failed to reach agreement  the slower a court will be to conclude that they had the requisite contractual intention  Jobern   FCA   involved a contractual dispute where the parties had executed a document entitled  Heads of Agreement   HofA  clause     of which stated   Each party will conduct all such negotiations in good faith to ensure that the terms set out in these Heads of Agreement are given full effect   It was not in dispute in Jobern that the parties were bound by the HoFA  which Gordon J stated to be a final agreement within the first category described in Masters v Cameron   HCA       CLR   at     However Gordon J considered that cl     was uncertain because it suffered from the same problems referred to by Kirby J in Coal Cliff Collieries   NSWLR   at    In Masters v Cameron   HCA       CLR     Dixon CJ  McTiernan and Kitto JJ explained in a joint judgment that where parties who have been in negotiation reach agreement upon terms of a contractual nature and also agree that the matter of their negotiation shall be dealt with by a formal contract  the case may belong to any of three classes  the first two involving binding contracts     The parties have agreed all terms and intend to be bound immediately but at the same time propose  to have the terms restated in a form which will be fuller or more precise but not different in effect      The parties have agreed all terms but intend to make performance of one or more terms conditional on the execution of a formal document      The intention may be not to make a concluded bargain at all unless and until the parties execute a formal contract  The judgment went on to explain that the question depends upon the intention disclosed by the language the parties have employed     and that there is no formula  such as  subject to contract  which is so intractable as always and necessarily to produce a result that there is no binding contract      The courts have also recognised a fourth class of case additional to the three mentioned in Masters v Cameron   HCA       CLR     a class identified by Knox CJ  Rich J and Dixon J in Sinclair  Scott   Co Ltd v Naughton   HCA         CLR   at   as       one in which the parties were content to be bound immediately and exclusively by the terms which they had agreed upon whilst expecting to make a further contract in substitution for the first contract  containing  by consent  additional terms  This fourth category was recognised by McLelland J in Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd v G R Securities Pty Ltd     NSWLR   and on appeal in G R Securities Pty Ltd v Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd     NSWLR   where McHugh JA delivered the Court of Appeal s judgment and observed that the magnitude  subject matter or complexities of a transaction may indicate that an agreement was a limited one not intended to have legal effect  D  but that what was critical was the parties  intention objectively ascertained  and that this intention should prevail  E F   In Uranium Equities Ltd   WASCA       WAR     the Supreme Court of Western Australia  Court of Appeal  stated at   that the fourth Masters v Cameron category was a variation of the first category  In Tasman Capital Pty Ltd v Sinclair   NSWCA     the NSW Court of Appeal emphasised that determining whether parties have come to a concluded agreement is a matter of their objectively ascertained intention in the particular case  Giles JA stated that the Masters v Cameron categories and a possible fourth category are intellectual aids  and that categorisation does not greatly contribute to the decision in the particular case  which is concerned with finding what agreement  if any  the parties came to     Similarly  in Moffat Property Development Group Pty Ltd   QCA     Keane JA  with whom McMurdo P and Atkinson J agreed  said at   in relation to classifying the putative agreement in that case under one of the four Masters v Cameron categories   In my respectful opinion  however  there is little purpose to be served in seeking to resolve the issue of classification  A concern as to classification should not be allowed to obscure or distract from the real task of the court which is to ascertain and give effect to the intentions of the parties  Keane JA referred to Sir Anthony Mason s opening address to the Journal of Contract Law   th Anniversary Conference     Journal of Contract Law           T he categories  or classifications of Masters v Cameron     HCA       CLR     be they three or four  are no more than exemplifications of the general principle that  in the case of written documents  the intention of the parties is to be resolved objectively and as a matter of construction of the relevant documents  The categories are necessarily subject to the general principle  The question therefore  which is of paramount importance here is whether or not the parties to the framework agreements intended them  objectively  to be legally binding  In Anaconda   WASCA       WAR     the issue was whether a binding contract for Anaconda  a company interested in lateritic nickel  to explore and mine for base metals on the tenements of Tarmoola  a company interested mainly in gold  had been made when a heads of agreement containing five clauses was signed  the last paragraph of which said that the heads of agreement   constitutes an agreement in itself intended to be replaced by a fuller agreement not different in substance or form    Tarmoola argued that there was no intention to contract  no agreement on essential terms  and that the agreement was incomplete and uncertain  By majority  the WA Full Court rejected these arguments and held that the heads of agreement was a binding contract  Ipp J  with whom Pidgeon J agreed  found that contractual intention was present  His Honour endorsed the existence of the fourth Masters v Cameron category in stating   It is well recognised that parties may enter into a valid contract containing a limited number of terms comprising those terms essential to the bargain that they wish to conclude  in the expectation that at a later date a further contract will be arrived at containing additional terms that would facilitate and clarify the initial contract  That is to say  a binding contract may be arrived at even though it leaves unresolved many matters which might arise in future   His Honour found that the agreement was neither incomplete nor uncertain such as to render it void or such as to indicate that the parties did not intend to enter into legal relations  and that the agreement contained all the essential terms required for a legally binding agreement  The omission to deal with particular future problems such as water did not make the agreement uncertain or incomplete  these issues could be resolved by processes of construction and implication     His Honour stated that the parties  failure to enter into a more detailed agreement may have made the exploring and mining operations contemplated by the heads of agreement more expensive  difficult and complex  but he did not accept that it was unworkable in the sense of it being objectively impossible for performance of its terms to be effected     In dissent  Anderson J noted that the trial judge had found this case to be in the third Masters v Cameron category  that is  a case in which the terms of the heads of agreement were not indtended to have and therefore did not have any binding effect of their own  and he agreed with the trial judge that the parties did not intend the heads of agreement to have binding effect as their concluded bargain     consideredMoffat Property Development Group Pty Ltd v Hebron Park Pty Ltd   QCA  http www austlii edu au au cases qld QCA  htmlASIC also points to the absence of the following from the framework agreements  no provision for choice of contractors or the selection of materials  no definition of  practical completion  and no specifications for any design elements of the infrastructure  The documents referred to in the Recitals to each agreement would have  no doubt  assisted in clarifying the matters absent from the agreements  In light of those documents  following the approach of Ipp J in Anaconda   WASCA       WAR   at     it may have been possible to conclude that  despite the long list of matters said to render the framework agreements uncertain and incomplete  there was a binding contract  workable by implying terms or on the proper construction of the agreement  The court will apply orthodox principles of implying terms by reference to the implied duty to co operate and use considerations of reasonableness  to give effect to that intention  Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games   NSWLR   Moffat Property Development Group Pty Ltd v Hebron Park Pty Ltd   QCA    The asserted uncertainty or incompleteness may therefore be overcome once the requisite intention to contract is found to be present  In Tasman Capital Pty Ltd v Sinclair   NSWCA     the NSW Court of Appeal emphasised that determining whether parties have come to a concluded agreement is a matter of their objectively ascertained intention in the particular case  Giles JA stated that the Masters v Cameron categories and a possible fourth category are intellectual aids  and that categorisation does not greatly contribute to the decision in the particular case  which is concerned with finding what agreement  if any  the parties came to     Similarly  in Moffat Property Development Group Pty Ltd   QCA     Keane JA  with whom McMurdo P and Atkinson J agreed  said at   in relation to classifying the putative agreement in that case under one of the four Masters v Cameron categories   In my respectful opinion  however  there is little purpose to be served in seeking to resolve the issue of classification  A concern as to classification should not be allowed to obscure or distract from the real task of the court which is to ascertain and give effect to the intentions of the parties  The approach taken in G R Securities   NSWLR   Anaconda   WASCA       WAR   and Tasman Capital   NSWCA   was followed very recently by the Queensland Court of Appeal in Moffat Property Development Group   QCA     mentioned above  which underlined the importance of the parties  manifest intention to contract  The issue was whether a contract for the sale of rural residential land had been made by an exchange of letters  The Queensland Court of Appeal held that the parties intended to be legally bound through their exchange of correspondence and that there was a contract even though matters such as the timing of completion and arrangements at settlement  the precise timing of the payment of the deposit  the place of settlement  responsibility for insurance  GST issues and the terms of a put and call option were not spelt out in the correspondence  Keane JA delivered the court s judgment  His Honour   a  accepted McHugh JA s point in G R Securities that  the decisive issue is always the intention of the parties       b  said  the terms of the correspondence exchanged between the parties contemplated the execution of a further contract as the means whereby the bargain which they had concluded would be implemented  It is necessarily implicit in such an agreement that the parties will co operate to do what must be done to make the further agreement     c  adopted McHugh JA s approach in G R Securities and explained that the implied obligation of each party to co operate with the other to ensure each side obtains the benefit of its bargain serves to supply the deficiencies     d  cited Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games   NSWLR at   in stating   I am of the view that there can be no doubt as to the orthodoxy of referring to  implied terms or     considerations of reasonableness  in order to determine whether the parties   consensus is sufficiently comprehensive to be legally binding      Accordingly  Moffat Property Development Group   QCA     has most recently emphasised that the central question is the parties  manifest intention to contract  and the court will apply orthodox principles of implying terms  by reference to the implied duty to co operate  and use considerations of reasonableness  to give effect to the parties  contractual intention  Alleged uncertainty or incompleteness is usually able to be overcome if the requisite intention to contract is found to be present  Was the opinion of FMG and Forrest honestly and reasonably held In my view  for the following reasons  the evidence  particularly as to the oversight and legal advice given to FMG by Huston and the adoption of FMG s opinion by the Chinese Contractors amply supports the conclusion that the opinion of FMG through Forrest that the framework agreements were legally binding agreements to build  finance and transfer the infrastructure  were reasonably and honestly held  It also disposes of ASIC s claim that if FMG had obtained competent legal advice it would not have made the disclosures it did as to the legal effect of the framework agreements  ASIC alleges in relation to FMG s disclosures that neither it nor Forrest genuinely held the opinion that each of the framework agreements was a legally enforceable build

    Dowsett J  with whom Jacobson and Bennett JJ agreed with generally  compiled at   a helpful summary of the propositions relevant to the application of s   emerging from the High Court s judgment in Campomar Sociedad  Dowsett J s summary  to which I have added references to the paragraphs of the High Court s judgment applicable to each proposition  is as follows  His Honour accepted that these observations are of general application in proceedings alleging contravention of s  H  of the Act     Conduct will only be misleading or deceptive  or likely to mislead or deceive if there is a nexus between such conduct and any actual or anticipated misconception or deception      In identifying such nexus regard must be had to the circumstances of the particular case  including the remedies sought  Section   of the TP Act does not confer any entitlement to a remedy for breach or anticipated breach  One must look elsewhere in the TP Act for such entitlement and construe the act as a whole      In some cases  a representation may be made to identified individuals  in other cases the representation may be to the public at large or to a section thereof  In the former case the process of deciding whether or not the representation is misleading or deceptive or likely to be so may be  direct and uncomplicated   In the latter case  the issue with respect to the sufficiency of the nexus between the conduct or the apprehended conduct and the misleading or deception or likely misleading or deception of prospective purchasers is to be approached at a level of abstraction not present where the case is one involving an express untrue representation allegedly made only to identified individuals    I infer that the word  representation  in   of Nike should be  misrepresentation  relying upon the relevant passage in Taco Bell to which the High Court was referring     When the representation is made to the public or to a section thereof  one must consider its effect upon an ordinary or reasonable member of the class in question  Although such class may include a wide range of persons  the ordinary or reasonable member will objectively be identified as having certain characteristics  In particular he or she can be expected to take reasonable care for his or her own interests and otherwise to behave reasonably      It is necessary to inquire as to how a particular or anticipated misconception has arisen or may arise  In so doing  the Court will consider  the effect of the relevant conduct on reasonable members of the class     Conduct will only be misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive if the representee  labours under some erroneous assumption  or may be expected so to labour  Such an assumption or anticipated assumption may be obvious  predictable or fanciful    In assessing the reactions or likely reactions of the ordinary or reasonable member of the class  the Court may decline to treat as reasonable  assumptions which are extreme or fanciful  The initial question which must be determined is whether the misconception or deception  alleged or anticipated  is properly attributable to an ordinary or reasonable member of the class      The  question whether particular conduct causes confusion or wonderment cannot be substituted for the question whether the conduct answers the statutory description contained in s      However  where there is a finding of intention to deceive  the court may more readily infer that the intention has been or in all probability will be effective  Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Pub Squash Co Pty

  HCA         ALR   at     Mason CJ  Brennan  Deane and Gaudron JJ referred to Dixon J s considerations in Briginshaw and said   The ordinary standard of proof required of a party who bears the onus in civil litigation in this country is proof on the balance of probabilities  That remains so even where the matter to be proved involves criminal conduct or fraud   On the other hand  the strength of the evidence necessary to establish a fact or facts on the balance of probabilities may vary according to the nature of what it is sought to prove  Thus  authoritative statements have often been made to the effect that clear or cogent or strict proof is necessary  where so serious a matter as fraud is to be found   Statements to that effect should not  however  be understood as directed to the standard of proof  Rather  they should be understood as merely reflecting a conventional perception that members of our society do not ordinarily engage in fraudulent or criminal conduct and a judicial approach that a court should not lightly make a finding that  on the balance of probabilities  a party to civil litigation has been guilty of such conduct   Emphasis added  Citations omitted

Feed Products     Lloyd s Rep  In Pagnan SpA v Feed Products Ltd     Lloyd s Rep   the English Court of Appeal held that a binding contract had been made in circumstances where no price  quantity  delivery date  loading rate  rate of demurrage and despatch or date of commencement in regard to the sale of corn gluten feed pellets had been agreed in an exchange of telexes between the parties  The fact that the terms yet to be agreed were of economic significance did not prevent a contract being binding if that was what the parties intended  Further  the fact that the parties continued to negotiate after the first agreement had been entered had no effect on whether the agreements were binding because      it was only to be expected that they would continue negotiating the terms that remained without delay   at      Lloyd LJ s listing of the principles to be derived from the authorities included at     that      the parties may intend to be bound forthwith even though there are further terms still to be agreed or some further formality to be fulfilled   Lloyd LJ also stated at      It is sometimes said that the parties must agree on the essential terms and that it is only matters of detail which can be left over  This may be misleading  since the word  essential  in that context is ambiguous  If by  essential  one means a term without which the contract cannot be enforced then the statement is true  the law cannot enforce an incomplete contract  If by  essential  one means a term which the parties have agreed to be essential for the formation of a binding contract  then the statement is tautologous  If by  essential  one means only a term which the Court regards as important as opposed to a term which the Court regards as less important or a matter of detail  the statement is untrue  It is for the parties to decide whether they wish to be bound and  if so  by what terms  whether important or unimportant  It is the parties who are  in the memorable phrase coined by the Judge   the masters of their contractual fate   Of course the more important the term is the less likely it is that the parties will have left it for future decision  But there is no legal obstacle which stands in the way of parties agreeing to be bound now while deferring important matters to be agreed later  It happens everyday when parties enter into so called  heads of agreement    Emphasis added   But at   Ipp J also referred to the statement of Lloyd LJ in Pagnan SpA     Lloyd s Rep   that I have extracted above  where his Lordship emphasised that that the meaning of  essential  in the context of agreeing upon essential terms was ambiguous and that there was no legal obstacle standing in the way of the parties agreeing to be bound now while deferring important matters to be agreed later  In Uranium Equities   WASCA       WAR     the parties to the putative agreement had been negotiating over a proposed mining joint venture  but no heads of agreement had been executed  The Court found that the trial judge was right in concluding that the parties did not intend to be bound by anything said or done by them until such time as the heads of agreement had been executed  The Court went on to state on the question of uncertainty at   that it is  trite  that  even when the requisite intention is present  a contract can fail for uncertainty  The Court said it is also trite that only the omission of an essential term will have the effect that a contract is so incomplete or uncertain as to render it invalid  citing Ipp J in Anaconda   WASCA       WAR   at     The Court referred to the statement of Lloyd LJ from Pagnan SpA     Lloyd s Rep at   and found that when regard was had to all the circumstances the parties did not intend to be bound by anything said or done by them until such time as the heads of agreement had been executed   The Court concluded that although some of the matters left over by the parties for future negotiation were important  none were essential to the efficacy of the alleged agreement in the sense that the agreement could not be enforced without it  In the same vein in Fletcher Challenge Energy Ltd v Electricity Corporation of New Zealand Ltd     NZLR   at   Blanchard J observed   The court has an entirely neutral approach when determining whether the parties intended to enter into a contract  Having decided that they had that intention  however  the Court s attitude will change  It will then do its best to give effect to their intention and  if at all possible  to uphold the contract despite any omissions or ambiguities       At   Blanchard J referred to the statement of the English Court of Appeal in Pagnan SpA v Feed Products     Lloyd s Rep      Merely because an important term is deferred

Manly Council referred to the principles concerning the application of Jones v Dunkel set out by Glass JA in Payne v Parker     NSWLR   at     which have been widely regarded as correct although Glass JA was in dissent as to the application of the principles to the facts  per Campbell JA with whom Beazley JA and Pearlman AJA agreed  at    In Payne     NSWLR     Glass JA said that whether Jones v Dunkel should be applied depends on establishing three conditions   a  the missing witness would be expected to be called by one party rather than the other       b  his evidence would elucidate a particular matter       c  his absence is unexplained  In my view  what Sackville J said in Singh concerning the application of the Jones v Dunkel principle to the case before him is merely an application of the second condition given by Glass JA in Payne at p   as to whether the principle can or should be applied  namely whether the evidence of the missing witness would elucidate a particular matter  There was no occasion to draw an inference from the Minister s failure to give evidence because in his Honour s view  the question of whether he took into account the character

officers  the chief executive officer stands at the apex of the operational and managerial structures of the company  and his or her authority is qualified only by any residual power left in the board  Randall v Aristocrat Leisure Ltd   NSWSC    A chairperson of a listed public company may have special responsibilities beyond those of other non executive directors  These responsibilities include such things as the public announcement of information  ASIC v Rich   NSWSC   at    Einstein J in Randall v Aristocrat Leisure   NSWSC   said at    Subject always to the terms of appointment  it is evident that the law tends to assume that where the board resolves to appoint a chief executive officer  his or her powers to control the operational and managerial aspects of the company s business will be broad indeed  In the seminal case of Freeman   Lockyer  a firm  v Buckhurst Park Properties  Mangal  Ltd     QB     for example  Lord Diplock held  at   that where a board permits a person to  act in the management or conduct of the company s business  that delegation of executive authority alone is sufficient to vest that person with ostensible authority to bind the company to transactions usually entered into  in the course of such business  by such managers    Moreover  and equally facilitative of the exercise by a chief executive of broad powers of company management  is the replaceable rule in s  C  of the Act  which provides that  t he directors of a company may confer on a managing director any of the powers that the directors can exercise  The breadth of managerial powers delegated to the chief executive officer by the board is ultimately contingent on the terms of appointment of the CEO  Harold Holdsworth   Co  Wakefield  Ltd v Caddies     WLR   as cited in Randall v Aristocrat Leisure   NSWSC   at     There is no evidence to demonstrate that Forrest s powers and authority as Chief Executive Officer were limited in any relevant way  I find that he was

Forrest submitted in written closing submissions that a Jones v Dunkel inference may not be drawn against an accused in a criminal case because the application of the rule in Jones v Dunkel is incompatible with the presumption of innocence and the rights of the accused  further  this reasoning applies with equal force to the accused calling other persons to give evidence  Forrest then submitted that the point of principle that  when an accused exercises the right not to give evidence the jury is directed that no adverse inference should be drawn  applies to a civil proceeding as against an individual defendant  He referred to the statement of Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne  and Heydon JJ in Rich v Australian Securities and Investment Commission   HCA         CLR   at   that the privilege against exposure to penalty serves the purpose of ensuring that those who allege criminality or other  illegal  conduct should prove it  and said there is no expectation that a defendant will give evidence on matters for which the plaintiff bears the onus of proof  He said there is no authority that supports the proposition that a Jones v Dunkel inference is available against an individual defendant in a civil penalty proceeding  though  he said  the position may be different for a company  Finally  Forrest submitted that inferences are to be drawn from the documents before considering any question of Jones v Dunkel   and a Jones v Dunkel inference is not be used in determining what inference ought to be drawn from the documents  citing Singh v Minister for Immigration

drawing inference  Jones v Dunkel   HCA         CLR   at     and     RPS v The Queen   HCA         CLR   at     ASIC submits that it should be inferred that Rowley  Liu and Watling were available to be called  but FMG chose not to call them for strategic reasons  As a result  ASIC says  if there are inferences to be drawn from documents in evidence  which could have been explained by these executives  or by Forrest who also elected not to give evidence  the inference should be drawn against FMG that the evidence of these executives would have been of no assistance to their case  and that the documents should bear the meaning contended for by ASIC  In RPS   HCA       CLR     Azzopardi v The Queen   HCA         CLR   and Dyers   HCA       CLR     the High Court considered the applicability of the rule in Jones v Dunkel to criminal proceedings  It decided that the rule is of very limited application to defendants in criminal cases  its reasoning based on the accusatorial nature of criminal proceedings  As an illustration of the Court s approach  in Dyers   Gaudron and Hayne JJ stated at    As was pointed out in RPS      it will seldom  if ever  be reasonable to conclude that an accused in a criminal trial would be expected to give evidence  Not only is the accused not bound to give evidence  it is for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt  The mode of reasoning which is spoken of in     Jones v Dunkel   ordinarily  therefore  cannot be applied to a defendant in a criminal trial  That mode of reasoning depends upon a premise that the person concerned not only could shed light on the subject but also would ordinarily be expected to do so  The conclusion that an accused could shed light on the subject matter of the charge is a conclusion that would ordinarily be reached very easily  But given the accusatorial nature of a criminal trial  it cannot be said that  in such a proceeding  the accused would ordinarily be expected to give evidence  So to hold would be to deny that it is for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt  That is why the majority of the Court concluded  in RPS and in Azzopardi   that it is ordinarily inappropriate to tell the jury that some inference can be drawn from the fact that the accused has not given evidence  In RPS   HCA       CLR     at     Gaudron A CJ  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ contrasted the reasonable expectation that a party in a civil trial would give or call relevant evidence in the circumstances described in Jones v Dunkel with the conclusion that it would seldom  if ever  be reasonable to expect an accused in a criminal trial to give evidence  Weissensteiner provides an example of where the latter would be reasonable citedS   I Publishing Pty Ltd v

www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlFMG made no submissions on whether Jones v Dunkel had any application  Citing Dyers v The Queen   HCA         CLR     Forrest submitted in written closing submissions that a Jones v Dunkel inference may not be drawn against an accused in a criminal case because the application of the rule in Jones v Dunkel is incompatible with the presumption of innocence and the rights of the accused  further  this reasoning applies with equal force to the accused calling other persons to give evidence  Forrest then submitted that the point of principle that  when an accused exercises the right not to give evidence the jury is directed that no adverse inference should be drawn  applies to a civil proceeding as against an individual defendant  He referred to the statement of Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne  and Heydon JJ in Rich v Australian Securities and Investment Commission   HCA         CLR   at   that the privilege against exposure to penalty serves the purpose of ensuring that those who allege criminality or other  illegal  conduct should prove it  and said there is no expectation that a defendant will give evidence on matters for which the plaintiff bears the onus of proof  He said there is no authority that supports the proposition that a Jones v Dunkel inference is available against an individual defendant in a civil penalty proceeding  though  he said  the position may be different for a company  Finally  Forrest submitted that inferences are to be drawn from the documents before considering any question of Jones v Dunkel   and a Jones v Dunkel inference is not be used in determining what inference ought to be drawn from the documents  citing Singh v Minister for Immigration   FCA         FCR   at     Before stating my conclusion on whether I ought to make any Jones v Dunkel inferences  I will deal with the final authority cited by Forrest  Singh v Minister for Immigration   FCA         FCR     from which he submits the following propositions emerge  that inferences are to be drawn from the documents before considering any question of Jones v Dunkel   and that a Jones v Dunkel inference is not to be used in determining what inference ought to be drawn from the documents  In Singh   the applicant sought judicial review of a Ministerial decision to refuse to grant a spouse visa on character grounds  The Minister s reasons for decision were given in two documents  a decision record and a statement of reasons  The applicant argued that the Minister erred in making his decision by failing to have regard to the character references in support of the applicant which were annexed to a letter attached to the decision record  The Minister did not give evidence at trial  but Sackville J found that the statement of reasons provided affirmative evidence that the Minister gave consideration to the contents of the character references  The inferences that the applicant sought to draw by the Minister s failure to give evidence were contradicted by the Minister s statement of reasons  In my view  what Sackville J said in Singh concerning the application of the Jones v Dunkel principle to the case before him is merely an application of the second condition given by Glass JA in Payne at p   as to whether the principle can or should be applied  namely whether the evidence of the missing witness would elucidate a particular matter  There was no occasion to draw an inference from the Minister s failure to give evidence because in his Honour s view  the question of whether he took into account the character references was adequately addressed by the statement of reasons distinguishedSouthern Cross Financial Group  Newcastle  Pty Ltd v Rodrigues     IPR  I will now turn to the cases

Motor Corporation Australia Ltd v Ken Morgan Motors Pty Ltd     VR   at     per Tadgell J  Faulkner v Thomas   TASSC   at     and Southern Cross Financial Group  Newcastle  Pty Ltd v Rodrigues     IPR   at      In Southern Cross Financial Group   IPR     Young CJ in Eq stated at   that in a contract for the sale of any article there are at least three basic requirements  precise identification of the parties to the contract  the property to be sold  and the price at which it is to be sold  In connection with the price requirement  his Honour referred to the analysis of Fullagar J in Hall v Busst   CLR at   and stated at   that this analysis made it quite clear that with  very  very  very few  exceptions  a contract to sell property at fair value is not binding and is incomplete  The exceptions included  an industry which has a measure of what a fair value is or there is some other criteria   I would add that Fullagar J stated at   that it would be sufficient if the sale was expressed to be for a price or value to be fixed by a named or described person  The CREC Framework Agreement did not simply state that the infrastructure items would be transferred at fair value or in like terms  Rather  the agreement expressly provided a pricing mechanism  Further  Southern Cross Financial Group   IPR   is distinguishable from the present matter because Young CJ found that the case was one where the parties intended there not to be a concluded contract unless and until a formal document had been executed  referred toTasman Capital Pty Ltd v Sinclair   NSWCA  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  htmlIn Tasman Capital Pty Ltd v Sinclair   NSWCA     the NSW Court of Appeal emphasised that determining whether parties have come to a concluded agreement is a matter of their objectively ascertained intention in the particular case  Giles JA stated that the Masters v Cameron categories and a possible fourth category are intellectual aids  and that categorisation does not greatly contribute to the decision in the particular case  which is concerned with finding what agreement  if any  the parties came to     Similarly  in Moffat Property Development Group Pty Ltd   QCA     Keane JA  with whom McMurdo P and Atkinson J agreed  said at   in relation to classifying the putative agreement in that case under one of the four Masters v Cameron categories   In my respectful opinion  however  there is little purpose to be served in seeking to resolve the issue of classification  A concern as to classification should not be allowed to obscure or distract from the real task of the court which is to ascertain and give effect to the intentions of the parties  Since Anaconda was decided by the Court of Appeal on   February   it has

importance of the parties  manifest intention to contract  The issue was whether a contract for the sale of rural residential land had been made by an exchange of letters  The Queensland Court of Appeal held that the parties intended to be legally bound through their exchange of correspondence and that there was a contract even though matters such as the timing of completion and arrangements at settlement  the precise timing of the payment of the deposit  the place of settlement  responsibility for insurance  GST issues and the terms of a put and call option were not spelt out in the correspondence  Keane JA delivered the court s judgment  His Honour   a  accepted McHugh JA s point in G R Securities that  the decisive issue is always the intention of the parties       b  said  the terms of the correspondence exchanged between the parties contemplated the execution of a further contract as the means whereby the bargain which they had concluded would be implemented  It is necessarily implicit in such an agreement that the parties will co operate to do what must be done to make the further agreement     c  adopted McHugh JA s approach in G R Securities and explained that the implied obligation of each party to co operate with the other to ensure each side obtains the benefit of its bargain serves to supply the deficiencies     d  cited Australian Broadcasting

likely to influence common investors in deciding whether to acquire or dispose of FMG s securities and thereby be information which a reasonable person would expect if it were generally available  to have a material effect on the price of FMG s shares  The threshold of relevant influence is not  in my opinion  a high one  ASIC  in this case  says that expert assistance is unnecessary for the Court  Senior counsel for ASIC submits that the question of influence for the purposes of s   involves primarily a commonsense test for the Court upon a consideration of the primary facts although assistance may be derived from experts who professionally buy and sell shares in large tranches and make investment decisions of the kind contemplated by s    I accept this submission  ASIC submits that the fact or likelihood of relevant influence of the Informations is obvious having regard to the nature of this information which individually and together concerned a step forward about the construction of the Project infrastructure  which was integral to FMG s plans  ASIC says that if the three framework agreements were to lead  as both parties evidently intended  to binding build  finance and transfer type agreements  this would be a major advance as it would secure finance and a construction agreement for FMG s total estimated payout costs of     billion  It adds that the likely influence upon common investors of the Informations is a matter of common sense  it was information which was very significant for the Project and its prospects of being realised  as it was a step forward in arranging for the financing and construction of the rest of its Pilbara infrastructure  ASIC seems ambivalent as to the effect of the Framework Agreements  It says  on the one hand

Division of the Supreme Court of Victoria concerned the enforceability of a purported agreement set out in a letter for two Toyota companies to rescue a motor vehicle dealer group of companies that was in financial trouble  The purported agreement contained   conditions relating to the rescue offer  Brooking J referred to many examples in the purported agreement of ambiguity  uncertainty and incompleteness  Tadgell J held that the Toyota companies did not send the letter to the dealer group as an offer  and accordingly  they could not have assented to it as embodying the terms of a contract  Furthermore  as Brooking J stated at    Each case is different  A relatively short letter may be held to record a binding agreement in a matter of great consequence and considerable complexity  in which numerous formal documents will have to be prepared and executed to give effect to the transaction  as in Custom Credit Corporation Ltd v Cenepro Pty Ltd  unreported  Court of Appeal of New South Wales    August    I respectfully agree with Brooking J  The brevity of the framework agreements does not of itself point to those agreements as lacking legal effect in circumstances where the agreements expressly referred to the preparation of fuller and more detailed agreements not different in intent  Toyota Motor Corporation   VR   does not assist ASIC  Each member of the court in Toyota Motor Corporation   VR   concluded that there was no contractual intention evident  Brooking J at   Tadgell J at   JD Phillips J at    This  of itself  distinguishes this decision from the present case  It is correct that no price was specified in the CREC Framework Agreement  but it is explicit as to the pricing mechanism that was agreed to apply  FMG had to make a down payment of only   of the value of the Works in exchange for a bank guarantee from CREC  which bank guarantee was to be returned when   of the Works had been completed  and thereafter FMG s obligations of payment were to arise progressively after practical completion  This was an agreement on the pricing mechanism  which meant that FMG was not required to raise capital before the Works were effected  save for the first   of the value  It was not an agreement to agree but arguably rather an agreement as to what would be in the general conditions citedTrade Practices Commission v

submission that the framework agreements are bare agreements to negotiate the scope and terms  in each case  of a further agreement to build transfer and finance the relevant Project infrastructure and that such agreements are not enforceable  Coal Cliff Collieries Pty Ltd v Sijehama Pty Ltd     NSWLR     Jobern Pty Ltd v Breakfree Resorts  Victoria  Pty Ltd   FCA     Walford v Miles     AC    Walford v Miles     AC   was an appeal to the House of Lords  The parties had been negotiating over the sale of a business  Their Lordships considered the validity of a  lock out  agreement  an agreement committing the seller not to negotiate with anyone other than the buyer over the sale of the business  The plaintiffs  the disappointed buyers  claimed that not only were the sellers  locked out  for some unspecified time from dealing with any third party  but were  locked in  to dealing with the plaintiffs for an unspecified period  The court considered the  lock in  agreement in terms of an obligation on the parties to negotiate in good faith  Lord Ackner  with whom all the other Law Lords agreed  stated that an agreement to negotiate  like an agreement to agree  is unenforceable  because it lacks the necessary certainty  Lord Ackner said at  G   A duty to negotiate in good faith is as unworkable in practice as it is inherently inconsistent with the position of a negotiating party  It is here that the uncertainty lies  In my judgment  while negotiations are in existence either party is entitled to withdraw from these negotiations  at any time and for any reason  There can be thus no obligation to continue to negotiate until there is a  proper reason  to withdraw  Accordingly a bare agreement to negotiate has no legal content  In my view Coal Cliff Collieries   NSWLR   Jobern   FCA   and Walford     AC   do not assist ASIC  I do not take Coal Cliff Collieries as authority for the proposition that a bare agreement to negotiate in good faith is not enforceable  as submitted by ASIC  In my view  that case is authority for the proposition that a promise to negotiate in good faith may  in particular circumstances  be enforceable  depending on the precise terms as construed from the contract  In Jobern   FCA     it was not in dispute that the heads of agreement document was binding only the negotiation clause was held to be uncertain  In Walford     AC     the agreement that was found to be uncertain was a  lock in  agreement committing the parties to negotiate with each other  which is to be distinguished from the types of obligations found in the framework agreements under consideration in the present case consideredWeissensteiner v The Queen   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlIn Azzopardi   HCA       CLR     in their joint majority judgment Gaudron  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ referred to Weissensteiner v The Queen   HCA         CLR   where the High Court held it was appropriate for the trial judge to direct the jury as to the manner in which they might take into account the failure of the accused to give evidence  and their Honours stated at   that what was important in Weissensteiner and what warranted the remarks to the jury in that case was that  if there were facts which explained or contradicted the evidence against the accused  they were facts which were within the knowledge only of the accused  and thus could not be the subject of evidence from any other person or source  At   their Honours emphasised that cases in which a judge may comment on the failure of an accused to offer an explanation will be both rare and exceptional and will occur only if the evidence is capable of explanation by disclosure of additional facts known only to the accused  Their Honours said a comment will never be warranted merely because the accused has failed to contradict some aspect of the prosecution case  In RPS   HCA       CLR     at     Gaudron A CJ  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ contrasted the reasonable expectation that a party in a civil trial would give or call relevant evidence in the circumstances described in Jones v Dunkel with the conclusion that it would seldom  if ever  be reasonable to expect an accused in a criminal trial to give evidence  Weissensteiner provides an example of where the latter would be reasonable  Further authority for the availability of the rule in Jones v Dunkel in civil penalty proceedings is found in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd     FCR     where Hill J stated at    Where the proceedings are criminal  and the present proceedings are not  they are proceedings  inter alia  for the recovery of a civil penalty  it might be thought that the failure of the accused to go into evidence should not lead to the drawing of Jones v Dunkel inferences  After all it is clear that a witness can not be compelled to give evidence which is likely to incriminate the witness or expose the witness to a penalty  However  even in criminal cases it has been held that the failure of the accused  who is in a position to deny  explain or answer the evidence adduced by the prosecution  to give evidence will permit the jury to draw inferences adverse to the accused more readily  see Azzopardi v R   HCA         ALR     affirming Weissensteiner v R   HCA         CLR    A fortiori  therefore  the failure of a respondent to proceedings for recovery of a pecuniary penalty to give evidence on a matter relevant to an issue in the proceeding and deny  explain or answer the evidence adduced against the respondent will permit the Court more readily to draw the inferences to which the decision in Jones v Dunkel refers citedWheeler Grace   PierucciPty Ltd v Wright     IPR  A reasonable reader of

conduct under s   of the TPA are useful when characterising conduct for the purposes of s  H  As Rolfe J observed in Wilkinson v Feldworth Financial Services Pty Ltd     ACLC   at   in relation to s   of the Corporations Law       the engaging in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive has the same meaning as  and should be treated in the same way as  those words

restatement of what was said by Dixon J in Willis v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at   who in turn had cited a passage from Uthwatt J in In re Bradberry  National Provincial Bank Ltd v Bradberry   Ch   at pp      Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees  Union   FCA         FLR   was a case under s  D of the TPA concerning secondary boycotts  It was  in that case  necessary that the impugned conduct  would have or be likely to have  the relevant effect  Consideration was given to whether  on an ex post view  the specified effect had occurred  Deane J at   citing Dixon J in Willis v Commonwealth   HCA       CLR   explained   if conduct had run its ordinary course and had not had the specified effect  it would be but rarely that a court would feel justified in disregarding the lesson of the event and finding that while the conduct did not have the specified effect it had been more likely than not that it would have had that effect citedWright v
