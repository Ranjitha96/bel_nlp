Collard v Australian Securities   Investments Commission  No     Corrigendum dated   November     FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedAnnetts v McCann   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I have already set out s   and my conclusion that it confers a right on the examinee s lawyer and not the examinee  That right is sufficient to attract the rules of procedural fairness  Annetts v McCann   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane and McHugh JJ  ASIC argued that the exercise of investigative powers was not generally subject to the rules of procedural fairness  It instanced Ryan v Australian Securities and Investments Commission     FCR   at         per Gyles J  The decision under challenge in that case  however  was a decision by ASIC to confer  eligible applicant  status on a person  The only effect of that was to permit such a person to apply for the issue of examination summonses which might result in the examination of a person  Gyles J ultimately held  at     In my opinion  the initiation of the exercise of a statutory power of an investigatory nature will not normally  destroy  defeat or prejudice   to use the words from Annetts v McCann   HCA       CLR   or  imperil   to use Meagher J s word  any relevant right or interest such as to require notice to be given to the object prior to exercise of the power  In any event  where  as here  the exercise of a power is anterior to that which has a direct effect upon the party  there is no such requirement citedApplicant VEAL of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Granted that such an obligation existed  what were the inspectors to do  They needed to provide Atanaskovic Hartnell with an opportunity to persuade the inspectors that the direction should not be given  This was not done and breach is established  There may be difficult cases where the inspectors have before them confidential information the very nature of which requires that it not be shown to the lawyer or to his or her client  However  the inspectors did not suggest that they had relied on any such information in the present proceeding  There was a redacted portion of the reasons of   October   but there was no intimation of what had been redacted  In any event  the Applicants did not complain that prejudicial but relevant material had been taken into account thereby  cf  Applicant VEAL of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         CLR   at     per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Heydon JJ followedAustralian Securities Commission v Bell     FCR   There were three issues between the parties    a  The identity and authority of the decision maker  ASIC contended that it had given the direction  The Applicants denied that the power to exclude Atanaskovic Hartnell from the examinations was a power which was vested in ASIC  They submitted that the power was vested in the inspectors  The inspectors were joined to the proceedings against this possibility    b  The reasonable grounds issue  The Applicants submitted that the Full Court s decision in Australian Securities Commission v Bell     FCR   meant that the inspectors  direction was liable to be set aside unless they the inspectors demonstrated during the present proceeding that there were reasonable grounds for a bona fide belief on their part that to allow Atanaskovic Hartnell to represent all three of the Applicants would be likely to prejudice the investigation  ASIC  on the other hand  argued that Bell was concerned with the evidential consequences of the regulator failing to provide any reasons for the making of such a direction  Since ASIC furnished reasons for its direction it followed that the principle was inapplicable  Even if that were not so  ASIC argued that the materials before the Court showed that there were reasonable grounds for a bona fide belief on its or the inspectors  part that to allow the Atanaskovic Hartnell to represent all three Applicants would be likely to prejudice the investigation    c  The procedural fairness issue  As an alternative  the Applicants argued that the power to exclude their lawyers from the examinations was a power the exercise of which attracted an obligation of procedural fairness  Since the inspectors did not give the Applicants any opportunity to argue that the direction should not be made  it followed  so the argument ran  that they had denied the Applicants procedural fairness  ASIC  on the other hand  denied that the power to exclude the Applicants  legal advisers from an examination was a power the exercise of which was conditioned upon adherence to requirements of procedural fairness  It pointed to the fact that the decision to summon the Applicants for examination in the first place was not subject to those requirements and asked  rhetorically  how in the midst of a process in which procedural fairness did not figure largely such an obligation might be found to exist  Against the possibility that it might be found to exist  ASIC submitted that  in the circumstances  the content of the obligation would be diminished to such a low level that it should be found that the obligation had been discharged   ASIC contended that it was it  as a corporate entity  that had given the direction to exclude Mr Hartnell and Atanaskovic Hartnell from being present at all the examinations  The Applicants made no express submission about that question but did submit that if ASIC was the decision maker  as it submitted  then it had no power to give the direction  This was because the power to exclude a person from an examination was conferred by s   of the ASIC Act and that provision conferred power not on ASIC but on the inspector conducting the examination   It is necessary in the first instance to identify with clarity who gave the direction  There are three matters bearing on this issue  First  there is the letter of Friday   October   written by Ms Dodds and Mr Astar which is on the letterhead of ASIC and is signed by both Ms Dodds and Mr Astar in their stated capacity as  Lawyer  Deterrence   It contains the critical passage      we have now considered the matter and formed the view      This argument should be rejected  Section   authorises ASIC to summon a person for examination before an inspector  Section   authorises the inspector to give directions as to who may be present during the examination  There is no warrant for reading s   as the source of the authority to give such a direction  In any event  the authority of this Court establishes that the source of the power is s   itself  Australian Securities Commission v Bell     FCR   at   per Lockhart J      per Sheppard J   In Bell v Australian Securities Commission     FCR   at   Pincus J held that s   did not permit an inspector to exclude an examinee s lawyer  This conclusion was reversed by the Full Court  Australian Securities Commission v Bell     FCR   at   per Lockhart J      per Sheppard J      per Burchett J  The binding nature of that conclusion is not open to doubt   The authorities do not establish this proposition clearly  However  at least two members of the Full Court thought that the right was conferred on the lawyer  Australian Securities Commission v Bell     FCR   at   per Sheppard J    per Burchett J  The matter is complicated because Burchett J also thought  at   that the client had a right to have his lawyer

The reasonable necessity is based on the views of the inspector if it appears necessary to the inspector then that will suffice provided that his or her belief is reasonably held  Put another way  the

    FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In Stockbridge v Ogilvie     FCR   examinees sought judicial review of a direction given by an inspector appointed by the Australian Securities Commission to exclude their lawyer  French J appeared to assume  at   without debate  that the right created by s   was conferred on the examinee s lawyer although it may be admitted that this is far from clear  In Macquarie Advisory Group Pty Ltd  rec apptd  v Australian Securities and Investments Commission     ACSR   at     the parties  and Byrne J  assumed that the right was conferred on the examinee  In Gangemi v Australian Securities and Investments Commission   FCA         FCR   at     French J assumed without discussion that the right was conferred on the examinee   Bell requires the conclusion  with which I agree  that the right is at least conferred on the examinee s lawyer  It is an open question whether the right is also conferred on the examinee  The right referred to by Burchett J in Bell as the right to have the lawyer s right enforced does not appear  with respect  to have a textual foundation  The right assumed to be vested in the examinee in Gangemi and Re Macquarie Advisory Group was the right in s   itself rather than the right adverted to by Burchett J   Only one judge  Sheppard J  has considered the matter in any detail  The statements by French J in Stockbridge and Gangemi do not appear to me to be intended to be taken as considered statements on the question and the statement by Byrne J is certainly not   The opinion which matters is that of the inspector  The only issue for the Court is whether that opinion is held on reasonable grounds and in good faith  Once that threshold is passed  the fact that the Court might not have made the direction itself is of no moment because the state of satisfaction which expands the operation of s   into the domain of s   is that of the inspector and not that of the Court  cf  Gangemi v Australian Securities and Investments Commission   FCA         FCR   at     per French J  Stockbridge v Ogilvie     FCR   at   per French J   For completeness  it is to be noted that ASIC had a similar inference drawn against it for failing to put on evidence as to the decision making process in Bell   FCR   at   per Lockhart J    per Sheppard J and  arguably  at   per Burchett J  Further  such evidence was put before the Court in Macquarie Advisory Group Pty Ltd v Australian Securities and Investments Commission     ACSR   at     per Byrne J and in Gangemi v Australian Securities and Investments Commission   FCA         FCR   at           per French J  Whilst it is true that in both Gangemi and Stockbridge that the reasons of the inspectors were before the Court it is also true that those reasons were delivered contemporaneously with the direction  The significance of such evidence in the present case was obvious  therefore  not only because the Applicants explicitly signalled their intention to doubt the usefulness of the statement of reasons of   October   but also from the course of authorities dealing with s     That approach may  of course  require that confidential evidence be given about the relevant concerns in this Court  This was expressly contemplated in Bell by Lockhart J  at   FCR   and Sheppard J  at   FCR   both of whom indicated that the processes of the Court could be adapted to deal with the exigencies obtaining in such a state of affairs  Consistent with that observation French J received a confidential affidavit in Gangemi  at   FCR       The question of whether the power in s   attracts a procedural fairness obligation has received little consideration  Sheppard J in Bell   FCR   at   thought that such an obligation did exist  Neither Lockhart nor Burchett JJ considered the issue  None of the decisions in Re Macquarie Advisory Group Ltd   ACSR   Stockbridge   FCR   or Gangemi   FCR   deals with the question citedHussain v Minister for Foreign Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Where confidential but prejudicial information is taken into account by a decision maker  the Court may fashion its own procedures to determine whether the nature of the information is such as to reduce the obligation of procedural fairness to nothing  Nicopoulos v Commissioner for Corrective Services   NSWSC         A Crim R   at       per Smart AJ  Hussain v Minister for Foreign Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at           per Weinberg  Bennett and Edmonds JJ  However  the difficult issues which may arise in that context were not ventilated in the present proceedings appliedJones v Dunkel     CLR   In those circumstances  the failure to call either the inspectors or Mr McGuinness permits me more comfortably to draw the inference to which I have already referred viz that the statement of reasons of   October   does not reflect the true basis for the actions of the inspectors on   October   when they gave the direction  Jones v Dunkel     CLR   at   per Kitto J    per Menzies J  and     per Windeyer J  I so conclude  It follows that I do not think that any reliance should be placed upon those reasons   In this case  however  there is nothing in the letter of   October   to indicate what the conflict was between the accounts of the Applicants  why those conflicts mattered or what it was that made it necessary for Atanaskovic Hartnell to be excluded  An inference is open that because those matters are not dealt with in the letter of   October   that the inspectors did not  in fact  turn their minds to those matters  I may more readily draw that inference in circumstances where the inspectors did not give evidence before me as to these matters  Jones v Dunkel     CLR   at   per Kitto J    per Menzies J  and     per Windeyer J   I am conscious that ASIC subsequently produced a set of reasons on   October    I have previously come to the conclusion that this set of reasons is not to be given any weight  Be that as it may  it might be thought that a belief on ASIC or the inspectors  parts that the second set of reasons would stand as the reasons for the direction may provide an explanation as to why no evidence was given by the inspectors or Mr McGuinness as to their grounds for the giving of the direction on   October    If that explanation were to be accepted as legitimate it would prevent the drawing of the inference to which I have referred  I do think that it is possible that the second set of reasons provides some explanation for the absence of evidence from the inspectors or Mr McGuinness  However  it is difficult to know whether that it so or whether the decision not to call them was made by other people for possibly other reasons   Ultimately  I think that it would be conjecture on my part to conclude that the reason the inspectors and or ASIC did not give evidence about the grounds underpinning the letter of   October   was because they  or their advisers  believed that the second set of reasons would perform that function for them  In that circumstance  I do not think that I can accept such a view as a sufficient or adequate reason for their not having been called such as would prevent the drawing of the inference to which I have referred  Accordingly  the only grounds that the inspectors had were the grounds set out in the letter of   October   and those grounds were not adequate in the requisite sense appliedProject Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Other provisions in Division   of Part   of the ASIC Act observe a distinction between ASIC on the one hand and the inspectors on the other  ASIC has the powers and functions explicitly conferred on it by ss           and      By contrast  an inspector has functions and powers conferred on him or her by ss                        a  and    b   If  as ASIC submits  all of the powers and functions of an inspector derive from the power conferred on ASIC by s     then this distinction between an inspector and ASIC in Division   of Part   is merely a textual oddity having no significance  That view is contrary to the general principle of statutory construction that in construing a set of provisions each word must be given meaning  Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority   HCA         CLR   at   per McHugh  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ  For those reasons  on its proper construction s   confers a power on an inspector in his or her own right and not upon ASIC   This means that ASIC s arguments that it gave the direction in question and that it had authority to do so must both be rejected  This conclusion has two consequences  First  the proper respondents to these proceedings are the inspectors themselves and not ASIC  Secondly  the inspectors were  in fact  clothed with authority to give the direction by s    For present purposes this means that the Applicants  claim against ASIC must be dismissed   Sections   and   of the ASIC Act provide        Examination to take place in private     The examination must take place in private and the inspector may give directions about who may be present during it  or during a part of it     A person must not be present at the examination unless he or she   a  is the inspector  the examinee or a member  or   b  is a staff member approved by ASIC  or   c  is entitled to be present by virtue of             i  a direction under subsection   or   ii  subsection

about matters about which the inspector has examined the examinee     If  in the inspector s opinion  a person is trying to obstruct the examination by exercising rights under subsection   the inspector may require the person to stop addressing the inspector  or examining the examinee  as the case requires   Note  Failure to comply with a requirement made under this subsection is an offence

Commission   HCA         CLR   at     per Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ consideredNational Crime Authority v A     FCR   The text of s   is  I think  plain  The right is conferred on the examinee s lawyer  In that regard  its wording is different from s   of the National Crime Authority Act    Cth  which provided  in part  that  a person giving evidence may be represented by a legal practitioner  and which was held by the Full Court in National Crime Authority v A     FCR   at   per Bowen CJ  Sheppard and Morling JJ to operate as a conferral of a right upon a witness   The notion that rights are conferred on lawyers rather than their clients is neither novel nor surprising  The right to file an originating process is conferred on a solicitor just as the right of audience is conferred on both solicitors and barristers  In each of those cases the right thereby conferred is to be exercised by the lawyer in accordance with his or her legal and equitable duties  To conclude that the right conferred by s   on a lawyer is to be exercised for the benefit of the client  and in accordance with lawful instructions  does not make it necessary to construe s   as conferring a right on the client   Reference has already been made to s   of the National Crime Authority Act    Cth  which expressly confers a right on an examinee to have a lawyer present during an examination  That Act did not confer on the Authority an explicit power to exclude a lawyer  However  s   of the Act conferred on the Authority the power to do all things necessary to be done for or in connexion with the performance of its functions  In National Crime Authority v A     FCR   at   the Full Court held that that power extended to the exclusion of a lawyer from an examination notwithstanding s    However  that meant that the extent of the power was coterminous with the degree of the necessity  Hence  the Full Court held  at   that the power to exclude a lawyer arose if the Authority  concludes on reasonable grounds and in good faith that to allow the representation either will  or may  prejudice the investigation which it is obliged to carry out    There was nothing novel about that conclusion  The fact that the power actually used depended upon the existence of a relevant necessity meant that an absence of such a necessity entailed ultra vires action  In that sense  it was for the Authority to show that its action was within power and to do that it needed to so show the necessity which activated the power in s     In Bell that test appears to have been grafted onto ss   and   of the former  but relevantly identical  Australian Securities Commission Act    Cth   Notwithstanding that s   expressly conferred a power to exclude which was absent from the National Crime Authority Act    Cth  Lockhart J concluded  at   that the power conferred by s   was subject to the same limitation that the Authority was subject to in National Crime Authority v A  namely  that the inspector must form the view that there are  reasonable grounds for a bona fide belief  on the inspector s part that to allow the particular lawyer to appear  will or is likely to prejudice the investigation which he is obliged to carry out pursuant to the requirements of the Act    The mechanism underpinning this reasoning appears to be the need to reconcile apparently contradictory provisions  It is true that s   is not expressed to be subject to the same limitation as s   of the National Crime Authority Act    Cth  namely  that the step sought to be justified had to be  necessary   However  to prevent the power to exclude in s   from devouring the whole of the operation of s     which entitled the lawyer to be present  it was necessary to place limits on the extent of the power thereby conferred  Lockhart J identified the limitation as one of reasonable necessity which was explicit in National Crime Authority v A   Burchett J expressed essentially the same conclusion  at   I agree that  despite the express language of the Act  it is implicit in the scheme for which the Act provides that he  scil  the lawyer  may be excluded  However  such a qualification upon the express entitlement conferred by the Act cannot be stretched beyond what the court can say is necessarily required for the carrying out of the examination for which the statute provides referred toNicopoulos v Commissioner for Corrective Services   NSWSC         A Crim R  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  Where confidential but prejudicial information is

and Investments Commission     FCR   I have already set out s   and my conclusion that it confers a right on the examinee s lawyer and not the examinee  That right is sufficient to attract the rules of procedural fairness  Annetts v McCann   HCA         CLR   at   per Mason CJ  Deane and McHugh JJ  ASIC argued that the exercise of investigative powers was not generally subject to the rules of procedural fairness  It instanced Ryan v Australian Securities and Investments Commission     FCR   at         per Gyles J  The decision under challenge in that case  however  was a decision by ASIC to confer  eligible applicant  status on a person  The only effect of that was to permit such a person to apply for the issue of examination summonses which might result in the examination of a person  Gyles J ultimately held  at     In my opinion  the initiation of the exercise of a statutory power of an investigatory nature will not normally  destroy  defeat or prejudice   to use the words from
