Incorporation Limited v The Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlIn relation to the questions of law in the notice of appeal numbered  i   ii   vi  and  viii  issues of law arise which I can consider  As pointed out in Ergon Energy Incorporation Limited v The Commissioner of Taxation   FCAFC   at   a question which is inelegantly drafted may nonetheless be a question of law if its purport is tolerably clear  having regard for example to relevant legislation  relevant authorities  the language of the Tribunal s reasons and the grounds stated in the notice of appeal  Reading these questions of law  the grounds of appeal  and the submissions of the applicant  I understand that the criticism of the findings of the Tribunal may be summarised and restated as follows     The Tribunal did not take into account a relevant consideration  namely the cognitive impairment aspects of post traumatic stress disorder and dysthymic disorder     The Tribunal failed to properly consider whether the incident at Nui Dat was a  severe stressor  affecting the applicant     The Tribunal made a finding not open on Dr Barry s evidence     The Tribunal took into account irrelevant considerations by adding improper criteria to the SoPs and then found that the applicant did not satisfy those additional criteria     The Tribunal failed to take into account Dr Mulholland s evidence     The Tribunal failed to take into account the passage of time as provided by s  h   Ms Bowskill for the respondent has framed her submissions in accordance with these issues  and I propose to consider each of these issues in turn  In his grounds of appeal  the applicant claimed that the Tribunal erred in not taking into account the medical factors which form part of the diagnosis of both post traumatic stress disorder and dysthymic disorder  in particular the cognitive impairment that manifested as the applicant s lack of memory of the events of   November   citedFenner v Repatriation Commission   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlFinally  in relation to both s  g  and s  h  I note comments by Mansfield J in Fenner v Repatriation Commission   FCA   where his Honour said  at par           whilst the directions of s  f   g  and  h  are of relevance to the way in which the Tribunal proceeded  they cannot remove from it the responsibility of applying ss   and  A and other relevant provisions of the Act according to the proper terms  I do not think the argument therefore really advances the appellant s case on this appeal  Those comments apply equally here  In the absence of further submissions explaining how s  g  and  h  are of relevance  in my view they add little to the applicant s case  I see no error of law in the decision of the Tribunal in relation to s  g  and  h  citedLeane v Repatriation Commission   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlA party to a proceeding before the Tribunal may appeal to the Court on a question of law from any decision of the Tribunal in that proceeding  s   AAT Act   This Court does not have jurisdiction to intervene if all that is shown is that the Tribunal has reached an erroneous factual conclusion  see Repatriation Commission v Hendy   FCAFC   at     Leane v Repatriation Commission   FCAFC   at    appliedRepatriation Commission v Deledio     FCR  In the proceeding before the Tribunal  the applicant claimed that the post traumatic stress disorder and dysthymic  or depressive  disorder from which he suffered resulted from his service in Vietnam  in particular an incident which took place in Vietnam on   November    The Tribunal  applying the four step test articulated by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Repatriation Commission v Deledio     FCR     Deledio   found in favour of the applicant on application of three of the steps  however found against the applicant on the final step which involved causation  In short  although there was no issue as to the fact that the applicant did suffer from post traumatic stress disorder and dysthymic disorder  the Tribunal found that these incapacities of the applicant were not caused by the incident of   November   and were not  war caused   The leading case articulating the process of reasoning the Tribunal is to undertake in considering a claim under the Act in respect of incapacity of a person from injury or disease  or in respect of the death of a person related to service rendered by that person  is the decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in Repatriation Commission v Deledio     FCR    The Full Court at     said as follows     The Tribunal must consider all the material which is before it and determine whether that material points to a hypothesis connecting the injury  disease or death with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the person  No question of fact finding arises at this stage  If no such hypothesis arises  the application must fail     If the material does raise such a hypothesis  the Tribunal must then ascertain whether there is in force an SoP determined by the Authority under s  B  or    If no such SoP is in force  the hypothesis will be taken not to be reasonable and  in consequence  the application must fail     If an SoP is in force  the Tribunal must then form the opinion whether the hypothesis raised is a reasonable one  It will do so if the hypothesis fits  that is to say  is consistent with the  template  to be found in the SoP  The hypothesis raised before it must thus contain one or more of the factors which the Authority has determined to be the minimum which must exist  and be related to the person s service  as required by s  B d  and  e   If the hypothesis does contain these factors  it could neither be said to be contrary to proved or known scientific facts  nor otherwise fanciful  If the hypothesis fails to fit within the template  it will be deemed not to be  reasonable  and the claim will fail     The Tribunal must then proceed to consider under s   whether it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the death was not war caused  or in the case of a claim for incapacity  that the incapacity did not arise from a war caused injury  If not so satisfied  the claim must succeed  If the Tribunal is so satisfied  the claim must fail  It is only at this stage of the process that the Tribunal will be required to find facts from the material before it  In so doing  no question of onus of proof or the application of any presumption will be involved  As I noted earlier in this judgment  the Tribunal was satisfied that the period of defence service relevant to the claim of the applicant  namely from   June   until   May   was operational service and eligible war service as those terms are defined in s   and s  C of the Act  Further  the Tribunal was satisfied that there was evidence for the diagnoses of post traumatic stress disorder and dysthymic disorder in the reports of the psychiatrists Dr Athey and Dr Mulholland  The Tribunal was also satisfied that  notwithstanding the fact that the applicant was on leave on   November   this did not affect his status of being allotted for operational service during that time  Finally  the Tribunal was satisfied that the applicant had not suffered injury as a result of serious default or wilful act as defined in s    The Tribunal then considered the four step course as outlined in Deledio that the Tribunal is to take in considering a claim of this nature  First  the Tribunal concluded that there was material pointing to a hypothesis connecting the applicant s claimed conditions of past traumatic stress disorder and dysthymic disorder with the events of   November    Accordingly  the first Deledio step was satisfied  Second  the Tribunal considered the position with respect to SoPs  SoPs are determined by the Repatriation Medical Authority pursuant to s  B of the Act  The Tribunal concluded that two SoPs were relevant  namely Instrument No   of    as amended by Instrument No   of   concerning post traumatic stress disorder and Instrument No   of   concerning depressive disorder  For the purposes of the claim  the relevant paragraphs were    In the SoP concerning Depressive Disorder  Instrument No   of   pars   and    Paragraph   defines factors that must as a minimum exist before it can be said that a reasonable hypothesis has been raised connecting the depressive disorder with the circumstances of a person s relevant service including                b  experiencing a severe psychosocial stressor or stressors within the two years immediately before the clinic onset of depressive disorder      Paragraph   defines  severe psychosocial stressor  as meaning       an identifiable occurrence that evokes feelings of substantial distress in an individual  for example  being shot at  death or serious injury of a close friend or relative  assault  including sexual assault  severe illness or injury  experiencing a loss such as divorce or separation  loss of employment  major financial problems or legal problems  Accordingly  the second Deledio step was satisfied  Third  the Tribunal found that the hypothesis advanced  namely that the psychiatric conditions of the applicant were attributable to the events of   November   was reasonable in the context of both the SoPs concerning Depressive Disorder and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  In doing so  the Tribunal accepted the summary of evidence given by the applicant and other witnesses  Accordingly  the third Deledio step was satisfied  However  the Tribunal found against the applicant in respect of the fourth Deledio step  In other words  the Tribunal found that the incapacities of the applicant  namely the post traumatic stress disorder and the dysthymic disorder  were not war caused  In summary       a  in relation to the claim for post traumatic stress disorder  the Tribunal was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the incident at Nui Dat on   November   did not have a significant effect on the applicant for reasons that        It was clear that  when giving evidence  the applicant s recollections of the event were vague    The applicant remained some distance from the injured men  and did not speak with them or provide assistance such as loading the wounded into a medivac helicopter    The evidence indicates that the applicant had no recall of any aspect of the event until he spoke with Mr Ellis at a reunion of personnel from his RAAF squadron   years later    The Tribunal was unable to accept the correctness of the applicant s recall of the nature of his reaction to the sight of the wounded soldiers    The evidence of the applicant and Mr Ellis and Mr Smith  both of whom also gave evidence  was that after they left the minefield they undertook an uneventful tour of Vietnamese villages    On   November   five days after the event  the applicant wrote a letter to his parents referring to the day he spent with Mr Ellis and Mr Smith but not referring to the minefield incident    The evidence of Dr Barry was  inter alia   that an inability to recollect details of a stressful event is a characteristic of post traumatic stress disorder  however that the minefield incident was in itself not sufficient to result in post traumatic stress disorder  Her diagnosis was that the applicant s post traumatic stress disorder was based upon the impact of a range of experiences  As a result of this however the Tribunal was concerned as to her evidence in the light of the applicant s claim as the SoP concerning Post Traumatic Stress Disorder requires the applicant to experience a severe stressor   The Tribunal was of the view that if the events of   November   did not constitute a severe stressor which was sufficient  in Dr Barry s diagnosis  to trigger post traumatic stress disorder  it would also not result in the suppression of memory which is a symptom associated with that disorder    The evidence of Dr Athey was  in the view of the Tribunal  of limited use as Dr Athey was not made aware of the incident of   November   by the applicant    The evidence of Dr Mulholland was  in the view of the Tribunal  coloured by the version of the events given by the applicant to Dr Mulholland  namely that the applicant had been  dragooned  into an  operation  in which he was  acting as an escort for the evacuation of wounded soldiers  which  lasted a few hours  and which left him  pretty much exposed   The Tribunal was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that what actually occurred on   November   was not consistent with the version relied upon by Dr Mulholland       b  In any event  the Tribunal stated that it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the incident at Nui Dat was not an event that met the requirements of  experiencing a severe stressor  as provided for in the SoP concerning Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Accordingly  the condition was not  war caused  under s      c  The analysis in relation to post traumatic stress disorder was equally applicable in relation to the applicant s claim concerning dysthymic disorder  namely as to whether the minefield incident was a severe psycho social stressor  The Tribunal was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence did not disclose a reaction by the applicant which equated to substantial distress  In the view of the Tribunal  while there is evidence that the applicant experienced depression not long after returning to Australia  this was as a result of events not associated with his service in Vietnam  These events were also referred to by the medical experts  specifically        the severance of the applicant s relationship with his then girlfriend   the applicant learning that one of the crewmen with whom he had worked in Vietnam had been killed there  As the Tribunal was of the view that the claim of the applicant did not satisfy the fourth Deledio step and was not war caused  the Tribunal affirmed the decision under review in relation to post traumatic stress disorder and depressive disorder  In terms of the four step test articulated in Deledio   which was applied by the Tribunal  the only  step  which is in contention is the fourth step which involves consideration of causation  As I noted earlier in this judgment  the Tribunal was otherwise satisfied that there was material before it pointing to a hypothesis connecting the applicant s claimed condition of depression and dysthymic disorder with the events of   November   that there were relevant SoPs in force supporting the hypothesis  and that the hypothesis was reasonable  As made clear by the decisions of the High Court in Byrnes and the Full Court in Deledio   once the decision maker has determined that the hypothesis raised is reasonable  the decision maker must then proceed to consider under s   whether it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the injury was not war caused   It is only at this stage that the decision maker will be required to find facts from the material before it  As the High Court said in Byrnes        The claim will succeed unless   a  one or more of the facts necessary to support the hypothesis are disproved beyond reasonable doubt  or  b  the truth of another fact in the material  which is inconsistent with the hypothesis  is proved beyond reasonable doubt  thus disproving  beyond reasonable doubt  the hypothesis  The respondent has submitted that the appeal is misconceived in so far as it is asserted in the notice of appeal that the questions of law raised on the appeal involve the misconstruction or misapplication of the SoPs  This is because the construction and application of the SoPs occurred at the third Deledio step  and at that stage of the reasoning the Tribunal found in the applicant s favour  In my view  the respondent s submission has merit  In particular  the questions of law in the notice of appeal numbered  iii   iv   v  and  vii  relate to issues which were decided by the Tribunal in the applicant s favour in the third Deledio step  In my view the submissions of the applicant on this point are not supported by analysis of the decision of the Tribunal  The Tribunal in its reasoning did recognise that an objective and subjective component of experiencing a severe stressor must be evident  In relation to post traumatic stress disorder  the Tribunal referred to Stoddart   in relation to dysthymic disorder the Tribunal referred to White v Repatriation Commission   FCA     a decision of Spender J which in turn referred to the test in Stoddart   Applying the test in relation to both disorders  the Tribunal was of the view  within the context of the third Deledio step  that the material concerning the applicant s observation of and reactions to the minefield incident did point to the existence of both objective and subjective components  However  in order for the post traumatic stress disorder and dysthymic disorder of the applicant to be related to the applicant s service within the meaning of the Act  clearly the Tribunal needed to consider the evidence within the fourth Deledio step as to the events that occurred and whether the applicant experienced a severe stressor  in relation to post traumatic stress disorder  or a severe psychosocial stressor  in relation to dysthymic disorder   At par   and par   the Tribunal found       The extent of  the applicant s  involvement was in seeing some injured soldiers and I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this was not an event that meets the requirements of experiencing a severe stressor as provided for in the Statements of Principles for post traumatic stress disorder   In relation to dysthymic disorder  the analysis above is equally applicable to whether the minefield incident was a severe psycho social stressor  Accordingly  the Tribunal formed the view on the basis of the evidence before it that the applicant s disorders were not war caused  It was not necessary for the Tribunal to consider whether the incident  might  evoke feelings of intense fear  helplessness or horror  In my view no error of law arises in the Tribunal s consideration of this issue citedRepatriation Commission v Hendy   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases

claimant s case relies upon the raising of a reasonable hypothesis to avoid the Commission being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that death is not  war caused  then s  A  and s  B will apply  if the hypothesis is one addressed by a determination made under s  B    Notwithstanding s  A  a reasonable hypothesis may be shown to be untenable and  therefore disregarded  if the Commission is satisfied under s   that the material before it proves beyond reasonable doubt that the assumed factual foundation for the hypothesis did not exist    Sections   and  A  will apply if the material does not establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Commission that the death was  war caused  and the Commission must consider whether it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the death was not  war caused  citedStoddart v Repatriation Commission   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlIn his grounds of appeal the applicant claimed that the Tribunal ignored the cognitive impairment aspect of the disorders  and failed to make a finding on whether the applicant s response involved intense fear  helplessness  or horror  This ground of appeal was supported by submissions that the Tribunal failed to make findings as to whether this event might evoke such feelings  and that the Tribunal did not apply the test in Stoddart v Repatriation Commission   FCA   and put itself in the position of Mr Byrne when he experienced the casualties which had occurred shortly prior to the arrival at the site  The applicant also claimed in questions of law  ii  and  iv  that the Tribunal failed to consider whether the applicant subjectively experienced a  severe stressor   Post Traumatic Stress Disorder SoP  and that the Tribunal failed to consider whether the applicant subjectively experienced a  severe psychosocial stressor   Depressive Disorder SoP   In making these claims  the applicant referred to the decision of Manfield J in Stoddart   In that case  Mansfield J found  inter alia   that the test of   experiencing a severe stressor  in the SoP concerning Post Traumatic Stress Disorder encompasses a subjective element  His Honour in that case held at   that the Tribunal erred because it had concluded that the acceptance of the applicant s claims about the occasions giving rise to his fears  do not objectively satisfy the relevant factors  namely being  confronted with an event or events that involved actual   or threat of death  or serious injury   His Honour said       In my judgment the language of the definition of  experiencing a severe stressor  caters for the applicant experiencing or being confronted with an event or events that involved threat of death or serious injury  or a threat to physical integrity  if the event or events which are said to constitute the threat  judged objectively from the point of view of a reasonable person in the position of and with the knowledge of the person experiencing those events  are capable of and did convey  ie are subjectively experienced  the risk of death or serious injury or to physical integrity  The applicant before me emphasises the words  risk of death of serious injury  in the judgment of Mansfield J and submits that the Tribunal did not use this test when assessing whether Mr Byrne subjectively satisfied the SoPs  In my view the submissions of the applicant on this point are not supported by analysis of the decision of the Tribunal  The Tribunal in its reasoning did recognise that an objective and subjective component of experiencing a severe stressor must be evident
