Taxation   NSWSC         ACSR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  htmlIn Cadima Express Pty Ltd  in Liq  v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation   NSWSC         ACSR     Austin J was of the opinion that the attitude of the liquidator to the merits of the action is particularly relevant to the Court s consideration  This flowed from the proposition articulated by Gummow J in Scarel Pty Ltd v City Loan   Credit Corporation Pty Limited     ACLR   at   that the ordinary rule is that the liquidator is the appropriate person to decide whether the company should commence proceedings  subject to review under the statutory provisions  His Honour considered that if the liquidator is of the view that the proposed litigation is soundly based  but he cannot pursue it because of an absence of funds  the Court will be more disposed to permit proceedings by a contributory in the company s name than in circumstances where he has decided that there is no reasonable foundation to bring proceedings  His Honour then referred to Partnership Pacific Ltd v Aliprandi     ACSR   where Cole J said that for an application to succeed more must be shown than that the liquidator s position is protected by an indemnity  Austin J     observed that the two cases indicate that the Court is entitled to have the assistance of the liquidator in making its assessment as to whether an arguable case has been demonstrated and that the Court will normally give weight to the liquidator s view  Nonetheless the position of the defendants is a matter going to the exercise of the Court s discretion  Cadima Express Pty Ltd  in liq  v DCT   NSWSC         ACSR   at     The liquidators do not oppose the application so long as neither they nor Pearl Coast are liable for any adverse costs orders  Mr Sharp has already paid from his own funds in excess of   on behalf of Pearl Coast  by way of costs and interest on those costs so that the action could proceed  By clause   of the Deed of Assignment it was agreed that Pearl Coast would not be liable for costs in connection with the action  I infer from this that Mr Sharp would be personally liable  That of course is no comfort to the defendants who  if successful  would likely obtain a costs order against Pearl Coast which in practical terms would be of no value notfollowedCarpenter v Pioneer Race Pty Ltd  in liq    NSWSC

Barrett J in Charlton v Baber   NSWSC         ACSR     was persuaded that his earlier view in BL   GY International was wrong  I am satisfied that leave ought to be granted subject to the following further orders  First  there should be an order that Mr Sharp indemnify Pearl Coast against costs and expenses incurred  including any adverse costs orders  provided however that  in the event that Pearl Coast succeeds in recovering damages or other monies through the derivative action  he may apply to the Court for reimbursement of the expenses he has met  See by analogy Carpenter v Pioneer

should determine the application  in the inherent power of the Court  The defendants are opposed to any consideration of this alternative basis for the relief sought because it was not originally argued on that basis  However the circumstances here are somewhat unusual given that the decision in Chahwan was delivered after argument on the motion but prior to judgment  It is likely  I think  that reliance would have been placed on the Court s inherent jurisdiction if Chahwan had been delivered before the hearing of the present motion  In any event  the parties have delivered fulsome

   FCA   involved a successful application to amend the capacity in which an application and statement of claim had been filed from  Errol Investments Pty Ltd  to  Errol Investments Pty Ltd as Trustee for the Shellharbour Unit Trust   Evidence was adduced of minutes of a meeting of the company resolving that the contract to purchase land would be executed by the company in its capacity as trustee of the Shellharbour Unit Trust as well as a contract for the sale of land that in one place  at least  referred to the purchaser as Errol Investments Pty Ltd as Trustee for the Shellharbour Property Trust  The judge was satisfied that the reference should have been to the Shellharbour Unit Trust  It is contended by the defendants that if Liquid was acting in its capacity as trustee of the Sharp Family Trust when it carried out the actions pleaded in paras     of the Substituted Statement of Claim  then it should have copies of the minutes of meetings  recording decisions to purchase properties  copies of the contracts for the sale and purchase of the properties referred to in the Substituted Statement of Claim  bank documents recording the application for facilities to be provided to Liquid  in its capacity as trustee of the Sharp Family Trust  relating to the property acquisitions and other tax and trust records  No such evidence has been put before the Court in this case  I do not consider this to be fatal to the application  Mr Sharp has deposed  in effect  that Liquid was incorporated as a sole purpose vehicle and never acted other than in its capacity as trustee of the Sharp Family Trust  There was no cross examination upon his affidavit  He was at all material times  the sole director and shareholder of Liquid  I am satisfied  for present purposes that the position is as deposed to by him  There was certainly nothing inherently improbable about his assertions nor are they inconsistent with any document which is before the Court  Liquid is deregistered  Mr Sharp was appointed trustee in its place nearly seven weeks prior to its deregistration  Liquid is not practically the  party  referred to in O   r    I infer that it was by some oversight that the proceedings were not brought by Liquid in its capacity as trustee  Had that occurred  then Mr Sharp would simply be seeking to be substituted for Liquid because he had been appointed as the new trustee on   September    I regard Mr Sharp as  in effect  being the  party  for the purposes of O   r    There will be an order that Mr Sharp  as trustee for the Sharp Family Trust  be substituted as the second plaintiff  I will hear the parties on the question of security for costs and otherwise invite the parties to bring in a draft minute of proposed orders to give
