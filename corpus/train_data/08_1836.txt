Smith v Zinifex Australia Limited  No     FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedSmith v Zinifex Australia Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  Zinifex became aware of these proceedings when it was served with the application and statement of claim in December    It sought a determination that the applicant was not empowered to bring the current proceedings  I decided that objection adversely to Zinifex  Smith v Zinifex Australia Ltd   FCA    After that decision was handed down Zinifex co operated with the enforcement authority and has agreed to these facts without the need for a trial  Although the Zinifex objection failed  it was clearly arguable and not an exercise in delay or obstruction   In my opinion the foregoing facts would provide some mitigation for the contraventions by Zinifex  The contraventions were not the implementation of a deliberate policy  but rather arose out of a reaction to the particular circumstance created by the TIC decision  In the light of Zinifex s industrial history and the fact that it no longer has any connection with Smelter  there is not a substantial need for specific deterrence in this case  On the other hand  the contraventions are of a law regarded seriously by the Parliament  as the maximum penalties indicate  General deterrence is relevant  I think in all circumstances the penalties sought to be imposed are reasonable   I certify that the preceding twenty nine   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Heerey    Associate Dated    December   Counsel for the Applicant  C Rawson     Solicitor for the Applicant  Australian Government Solicitor     Counsel for the Respondent  S J Wood     Solicitor for the Respondent  Minter Ellison   Date of Hearing    December       Date of Judgment    December           AustLII  Copyright Policy   Disclaimers   Privacy Policy   Feedback   URL  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html
