AMI Australia Holdings Pty Limited v Bade Medical Institute  Aust   Pty Limited  No     FCA     December  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred to  th Cantanae Pty Ltd v Shoshana Pty Ltd     ALR  Section   provides as follows      False or misleading representations   A corporation shall not  in trade or commerce  in connexion with the supply or possible supply of goods or

and  d   There is no reason to give these provisions anything other than their normal meaning  In McDonald s Systems of Australia Pty Ltd v McWilliams Wines Pty Ltd     ALR   at   Franki J considered the meaning of the terms   sponsorship   and   approval    His Honour there concluded as to the meaning of these two terms as follows      In Weitmann v Katies Ltd     FLR   at   I had occasion to consider the meaning of the word  sponsorship  in s  c  and I said   The word  sponsorship  in connection with trade marks or trade names seems to envisage something more along the lines of a certification mark   I see no reason to change this view and I consider that the word  sponsorship  in s  c  should be construed in a way appropriate to the construction of such a word in a section creating a criminal offence              The next question is whether there was a representation by the respondent that its wine had  approval  which it did not have      The Oxford Dictionary defines  approval  as  the action of approving  sanctioning  approbation   The most appropriate meanings of  approve  in the Oxford Dictionary are  in my opinion   to confirm authoritatively  to sanction  to pronounce to be good  commend            It has  however  been questioned whether these definitions place   too narrow a meaning upon these terms  attached as they are to the verb  represent         th Cantanae Pty Ltd v Shoshana Pty Ltd     ALR   at   per Gummow J  Nor should any constrained meaning be placed upon the term   affiliation   as used in s  d   In Mark Foys   FCA       FCR     conduct was held to fall within s  c  and  d  in circumstances where a television sales company pursued a marketing strategy of associating itself with the defunct Mark Foys department store  See also

falsely represented that the site had some affiliation with or association with the Sydney Opera House  See also Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Wizard Mortgage Corporation Limited   FCA       ATPR      The essence of the action in passing off  it may thus be noted  is the protection of a plaintiff s goodwill attaching to a business or commercial venture  In Campomar   HCA   at       CLR at   Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow  Kirby  Hayne and Callinan JJ thus observed that      passing off  at least so far as concerns equitable relief  protects against injury to the goodwill built up by the activities of the plaintiff    It is not concerned with an invasion of privacy    th Cantanae     ALR at   per Gummow J  The tort includes      circumstances involving the deceptive or confusing use of names  descriptive terms or other indicia to persuade purchasers or customers to believe that goods or services have an association  quality or endorsement which belongs or would

   ALR at   per Gummow J citedAllen Manufacturing Co Pty Ltd v McCallum   Co Pty Ltd   FCA       IPR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThereafter  however  there have emerged two lines of authority such that the path to be followed remains unclear  In Cooper v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd   FCAFC       FCR     Kenny J expressed these two lines of authority as follows        The law concerning the liability of directors and other officers for corporate wrongdoings is unclear  see Allen Manufacturing Company Pty Ltd v McCallum   Company Pty Ltd     IPR   at     per Wilcox  French and Dowsett JJ   Allen Manufacturing    There are two relevant lines of authority  each supportive of a different test  As the Full Court said in Allen Manufacturing   IPR at             One line supported     the   Performing Right Society test  whether the director had  directed or procured  the company s infringement  The other line supported  the Mentmore test  whether the director had engaged in  the deliberate  wilful and knowing pursuit of a course of conduct that was likely to constitute infringement or reflected an indifference to the risk of it               No Full Court of this Court has settled which of these two tests is to be preferred  see Allen Manufacturing   IPR at     and Sydneywide Distributors Pty Ltd v Red Bull Australia Pty Ltd   FCAFC         IPR   at     per Weinberg and Dowsett JJ   Sydneywide    In Root Quality Pty Ltd v Root Control Technologies Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR     Root Quality   Finkelstein J discussed both tests and concluded at   that  t he director s conduct must be such that it can be said of him that he was so personally involved in the commission of the unlawful act that it is just that he should be rendered liable   I tend to agree with his Honour s approach  compare also Universal Music   FCA       FCR   at         Branson J did not express a preference for either test and the remaining member of the Court  French J  simply agreed with the conclusion of Branson and Kenny JJ that the appeal should be dismissed  Notwithstanding the acknowledgment that there are these two distinct lines of authority  the Full Court has suggested that the differences may be more apparent than real  In Allen Manufacturing Co Pty Ltd v McCallum   Co Pty Ltd   FCA       IPR   Wilcox  French and Dowsett JJ concluded        The difference between the two tests may be more apparent than read  sic   We are not aware of any case in which it has been held that a director or officer of a company directed or procured the company s infringing act  yet that person escaped liability because he or she did not deliberately  wilfully or knowingly pursue a course of conduct that was likely to constitute infringement or that reflected indifference to the risk of infringement  This may be because  in practice  an act of direction or procurement will generally meet the Mentmore test  It is notable that  in Mentmore itself  the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal declined  at   to  go so far as to hold that the director or officer must know or have reason to know that the acts which he directs or procures constitute infringement   The court declined to do this because that  would be to impose a condition of liability that does not exist for patent infringement generally        The same conclusion was reached by Gordon J in LED Technologies Pty Ltd v Elecspess Pty Ltd   FCA   at   to     FCA         IPR   at   to   referred toAMI Australia Holdings Pty Limited v Bade Medical Institute  Aust  Pty Limited   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe hearing was initially set down for final hearing in December    An application made prior to that date by the Fourth Respondent for the vacation of those dates was rejected  AMI Australia Holdings Pty Limited v Bade Medical Institute  Aust  Pty Limited   FCA    But the final hearing did not in any event proceed in December   because of the absence of the Fifth Respondent  She was unfit to attend because she had recently undergone dental treatment  After the vacation of the December   hearing dates  the final hearing of the proceeding was listed to take place on   and   April    But on those dates the hearing again did not proceed due to what was said to be a   psychological disorder   of the Fifth Respondent which rendered her   unfit for court    So much  at least  was the assertion in what could only be described as a cursory medical certificate of a medical practitioner  No further details were provided  Indeed  the Fifth Respondent was not present in Court when the matter was called for hearing  The hearing was adjourned for a short period and she ultimately appeared later in the morning  Notwithstanding reservation as to whether the hearing should nevertheless proceed on   and   April   the hearing was adjourned until   and   June    The Fifth Respondent was informed that no further adjournment would be entertained unless a medical certificate was provided which set forth sufficient detail such that an informed view could be formed as to her condition and the doctor providing any such further certificate was made available for such questioning as was considered appropriate  An application was made at the outset of the hearing on   June   by Counsel then appearing for the Third Respondent by way of a Notice of Motion filed on   April    The substantive relief sought in that Motion was to amend the Defence as filed by the Third Respondent on   October   in particular  to amend the Defence to withdraw an admission in relation to paragraphs   and   of the Statement of Claim   which alleges         At all material times  the Third Respondent  Mr Wade  and Fourth Respondent  Dr Beaini  have been the sole directors of Bade             By reason of the matters pleaded in paragraph   above  at all material times Mr Wade and Dr Beaini have been the controlling minds of and in positions to control and or have controlled  Bade       The identification in paragraph   of the two Respondents is an obvious error   it is Dr Beaini who is the Third Respondent  Mr Wade is the Fourth Respondent  But nothing turns on that error  The amendment sought to be made to the Defence was to   not admit   paragraphs   and    The reference to   Bade   is a reference to the First Respondent  the Bade Medical Institute  There was no dispute that Dr Beaini was a director of the Bade Medical Institute from   May   to   December    It is the departure from the admission that Dr Beaini was a   controlling mind   of the Bade Medical Institute that Dr Beaini sought to achieve  Affidavits relied upon in support of the Motion and filed on   April   annex correspondence dating back to December    It was at that stage that those appearing for Dr Beaini first flagged a desire to withdraw the admission  The Applicants  solicitors sought particulars in December   of   the basis upon which your client wishes to now be released from his admissions    The response to that request in April   was to contend   that your request for particulars is not an appropriate request        Undertaking a side by side comparison  it is concluded that the marks are not   substantially identical       The most prominent feature of the AMI trademark is the white circular disc with the centre cut out  Attention is drawn to this image because of its position and it being set against a contrasting background  Another prominent feature of the mark is the acronym   AMI   displayed directly beneath the circular disc in bold white type  The words   Advanced Medical Institute of Australia   positioned immediately below the acronym  attract less attention because of their smaller size and compressed typeset  The Bade logo of which the Applicants complain has different salient features  In contrast to the AMI mark  in which the circular disc is a particular feature  the prominent feature of the Bade logo is the stylised text   bademedicalinstitute    The first two words of this phrase are emphasised in bold typeface  Unlike the AMI mark  the Bade logo includes neither a circular disc image nor an acronym  Perhaps the most similar feature of the two marks is the semi circular device in the upper left portion of each mark  In the AMI mark  the device takes the form of a series of close set lines that appear to radiate from the circular disc at the centre of the mark  In contrast  in the Bade logo it is an elongated crescent that frames the text at the centre of the mark  In this way  each of these distinct semi circular devices operates to accentuate the main distinguishing feature of the respective marks  serving to better distinguish each mark from that of its competitor  It is thus concluded that the marks are sufficiently distinct from one another that they cannot be said to be   substantially identical    The manner in which the Bade Medical Institute promoted and sold its own products diverted sales away from the Applicants  The apparent similarity in the names being used was supported  in part  by some evidence of those who bought the Respondents  products  A private enquiry agent who had been retained by the Applicants thus gave evidence of a phone call made in December   to the Bade Medical Institute and the following conversation  He said  Hello  Jack speaking I said  Who have I called  He said  Bade  I said  I ve rung in relation to erectile problems  and am enquiring about your products     There then followed a conversation as to the product itself as follows  I said      What is the cost of the spray  He said    and you get about fifty doses for that  I said  Are you AMI  He said  Yes  Australian Medical Institute  I said  Are you the ones that advertise AMI everywhere  He said No  that is the Advanced Medical Institute  I said  You re not the same  He said  No  we re different  Can you give me your name and address to send the spray to     Notwithstanding the acknowledgment that   we re different   the association with   AMI   remained  As against the Second Respondent  World Wide Internet Services  Aust   Pty Ltd  contraventions of ss        a     aa     c  and    d  of the Trade Practices Act were alleged  Again  it is not in dispute that the Second Respondent  was the holder  owner and operator of all domain names used by the First Respondent  and provided the website and hosting capacity for the websites used by the First Respondent in relation to its business   World Wide Internet Services  Aust   Pty Ltd registered approximately   domain names  including Another contention pursued by the Applicants was that Mr Wade and the Bade Medical Institute intentionally set out to   intercept   people searching the internet for access to the Applicants  products and to divert them to their own products  One explanation provided by Mr Wade was that the initials   AMI   stood for   acute myocardial infarction    At one stage during the cross examination  Mr Wade was taken to a list of searches undertaken on the internet  An exchange occurred as follows      There is not a single instance in this list where someone has looked for acute myocardial infarction    Oh no  Whatever I             You accept that  don t you    Whatever I AMI  you say the word AMI  It s one of the salient acronyms for acute myocardial infarction  which is one of the cause of  impotence   I ve even put the word viagra alternatives but I wasn t selling Viagra          Mr Wade  no one would search for AMI and nasal delivery unless they intended to look for the applicant s products and understand something about them    Ridiculous  You have an assumption of your term AMI that you own everything between here and Botswana for the word AMI       The explanation provided by Mr Wade for the acronym   AMI   is rejected  It is considered that it was used for the very purpose being suggested by the cross examiner  Although too much reliance should not be placed upon inconsistencies in the evidence of different witnesses  such inconsistencies as do exist are not to be disregarded and serve as a source of concern as to the reliability of the balance of the evidence being given by the Respondents  One instance may be given  The name   Maxine May   appeared on innumerable emails  The evidence of Mr Wade was as follows      So who s Maxine May      Nobody        So they were keeping records     No  Maxine May was like it was just another email address  I had numerous email addresses but actually there was no Maxine May as a person       But Ms Wade was questioned as to the identity of people variously described in emails and the following exchange occurred      Maxine May  was that Maxine May as well    That is his girlfriend  Why don t you get her up  Who is Maxine May    His girlfriend  His girlfriend was every his girlfriend ruled whatever his girlfriend said  he did       Inappropriate weight should not be given to such inconsistencies   especially in a working environment such as apparently prevailed at the Bade Medical Institute where people were known by various names and where an email may be addressed in a manner of convenience rather than specifically attempting to identify a particular person  It matters not whether the name of the   girlfriend   was   Maxine May   that which matters is Mr Wade s assertion that she was   nobody    Another instance is that Mr Wade maintained that he had not   worked with   his daughters  Ms Vicky Wade and Ms Patricia Wade  Yet emails in January   were sent to and from Ms Patricia Wade concerning the business of the Bade Medical Institute and Mr Wade accepted that she   did graphics   for the business  Dr Beaini  like Mr Wade  maintained that Ms Vicky Wade   had no role in Bade    Yet there was evidence of a phone call being made to the Bade Medical Institute and the telephone being answered by a woman who identified herself as   Vicky    Taken on its own  and given the apparent ease with which people assumed a variety of names  little weight is to be given to such an isolated telephone call  Indeed  such evidence established little  More persuasive of an involvement on the part of at least Ms Patricia Wade  however  was an exchange of emails in March   when attempts were being made to establish the business of the Bade Medical Centre overseas  One email from   patriciawade   thus stated      Subject  RE  BADE MEDICAL INSTITUTE UK EUROPE  Mediserve have signed I have sent you the signed agreement in pdf form We need their site up asap  I will liase re their logos  Please print and send to Mediserve for their records       The other daughter  Ms Vicky Wade  was also   copied in   on this exchange of emails  Dr Beaini maintained that  from about March or April   he no longer wanted   to deal with Bade   and from   basically around that time I was tapering off    He continued writing prescriptions until September    Certainly by late November   the relationship between Dr Beaini  on the one hand  and the Fourth and Fifth Respondents  on the other  had deteriorated  On   November   for instance  he wrote to the National Australia Bank  The subject matter addressed in the letter was the   Bade Medical Institute   and an account held with the bank  identifying both the BSB number and the account number  Dr Beaini wrote that his   partners   identified in cross examination as Mr and Ms Wade  were still selling products without his involvement and this made   their action illegal    The bank was asked to    p lease freeze this account as a matter of urgency    In addition to the manner in which Dr Beaini referred to the Fourth and Fifth Respondents as his   partners   the letter also exposed that Dr Beaini had a sufficiently detailed knowledge of the business activities of the Bade Medical Institute to know the specific details of the bank account  Notwithstanding the terms in which the letter was expressed  it is also curious to note that when asked as to the response of the bank to the letter Dr Beaini stated that he   presume d  they froze the account  I didn t really follow it up  to be honest    Had his intent been to sever all ties  a more immediate interest in the state of the bank account might have been expected  Notwithstanding his repeated assertions that his involvement in the business activities of the Bade Medical Institute and the promotion of the business by the Fourth Respondent was primarily confined to carrying out consultations  writing prescriptions and participating in the medical content of the advertising material contained on the internet  it is not considered that his involvement was so confined  It is not considered that Dr Beaini was as forthcoming in his dealings with the Bade Medical Institute and the Fourth and Fifth Respondents as was desirable  His repeated attempts to explain what he thought was important  as opposed to answering the questions being put to him  may be understandable  As a medical practitioner  it is suspected that he may have felt as uncomfortable in the witness box as his cross examiner would have felt on an operating table  It may also be readily understandable that Dr Beaini saw his involvement in the business activities of the Bade Medical Institute primarily through the eyes of a medical practitioner  But such an understanding does not deny him knowledge of the more general business activities of his   partners    An apparent failure on his part to produce such documents and records as may have supported his case only serves to reinforce a lack of confidence in accepting his account unquestioningly  It is considered that his involvement was greater than he was prepared to disclose  Considerable reservation has been previously expressed as to the medical evidence sought to be relied upon by the Fourth Respondent when seeking a vacation of the December   hearing dates  AMI Australia Holdings   FCA   at   to    And considerable reservation is expressed as to whether or not the Fifth Respondent was in fact   unfit for Court   in April   as claimed  For whatever reason  there has been a substantial period of delay between December   when the Applicants were ready to proceed  and June    There was also a further  more limited delay between the conclusion of the hearing in June   and the hearing of final submissions in August    To a large extent that latter delay was occasioned by a desire to ensure that the case for the Applicants was outlined in a sufficiently detailed manner that the unrepresented Respondents would have an adequate opportunity to comprehend how the Applicants sought to marshal the law and the facts against them appliedAnheuser Busch Inc v Budejovicky Budvar   FCA       IPR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlBy way of contrast  whether a mark is   deceptively similar   is not to be determined by a side by side comparison  but rather by reference to whether there is a likelihood of deception or confusion from a recollection or impression of the registered mark  Anheuser Busch Inc v Budejovicky Budvar   FCA   at     FCA         IPR   at    Allsop J there observed  citations omitted        The question of deceptive similarity must be judged by a comparison different from the side by side comparison undertaken to assess substantial identity  the question being the likelihood of deception or confusion from a recollection or impression of the registered mark  Thus  a side by side comparison is inadequate  and too narrow a test  The comparison is between  on the one hand  the impression based on recollection of the registered mark used in a normal or fair manner that persons of ordinary intelligence and memory would have  and  on the other hand  the impressions that such persons would get from the impugned mark as it appears in the use complained of          See also  E   J Gallo

the Trade Practices Act and the tort of passing off  e g  The Architects  Australia  Pty Ltd v Witty Consultants Pty Ltd   QSC    There are   close similarities   between the two causes of action

g  The Architects  Australia    QSC   at   per Chesterman J  In determining whether a plaintiff has established distinctiveness in the name or names with which it contends that the goodwill which it seeks to protect has become associated  useful guidance is provided by the following observations of Hill J in Equity Access Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation   FCA         IPR   at       Just as the distinction between descriptive and fancy names is not a distinction of law so too it is wrong to see the distinction in black and white terms  The reality is that there is a continuum with at the extremes purely descriptive names at the one end  completely invented names at the other and in between  names that contain ordinary English words that are in some way or other at least partly descriptive  The further along the continuum towards the fancy name one goes  the easier it will be for a plaintiff to establish that the words used are descriptive of the plaintiff s business  The closer along the continuum one moves towards a merely descriptive name the more a plaintiff will need to show that the name has obtained a secondary meaning  equating it with the products of the plaintiff  if the name admits of this   a purely descriptive name probably will not  and the easier it will be to see a small difference in names as adequate to avoid confusion       There need not be an exact or even substantial similarity in the nature of the two businesses  The Architects  Australia    QSC   at   to   per Chesterman J  The reference to the   Performing Right Society test   is a reference to Performing Right Society Ltd v Ciryl Theatrical Syndicate Ltd     KB   at   where Atkin LJ said      If the directors themselves directed or procured the commission of the act they would be liable in whatever sense they did so  whether expressly or impliedly       In Microsoft Corporation v Auschina Polaris Pty Ltd     FCR   at   to   Lindgren J said of this test      The  procured or directed  test  sometimes referred to as the  authorised  procured or directed  test  focuses attention on the relationship between the director s intention and the particular corporate conduct which the law characterises as tortious  What seems to underlie this test is the notion that  necessarily  companies can engage in tortious conduct only through human beings  and  at least ordinarily  where a particular human being involved and responsible to an appropriate extent can be identified  he should  as a matter of policy  be liable  After all  even if the aggrieved party did not sue him  apparently he would be liable to indemnify the company in respect of its liability to the aggrieved party       A director who   procures or directs   his company to perform a tortious act may thus be liable along with his company  The Architects  Australia  Pty Ltd   QSC   at   per Chesterman J citedArdelle v Spastic Society of Victoria Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe purpose of an award of interest  however  is compensatory and not punitive  Ardelle v Spastic Society of Victoria Ltd   FCA   at     Whatever be the reason for the delay in the resolution of the

in the name or names with which it contends that the goodwill which it seeks to protect has become associated  useful guidance is provided by the following observations of Hill J in Equity Access Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation   FCA         IPR   at       Just as the distinction between descriptive and fancy names is not a distinction of law so too it is wrong to see the distinction in black and white terms  The reality is that there is a continuum with at the extremes purely descriptive names at the one end  completely invented names at the other and in between  names that contain ordinary English words that are in some way or other at least partly descriptive  The further along the continuum towards the fancy name one goes  the easier it will be for a plaintiff to establish that the words used are descriptive of the plaintiff s business  The closer along the continuum one moves towards a merely descriptive name the more a plaintiff will need to show that the name has obtained a secondary meaning  equating it with the products of the plaintiff  if the name admits of this   a purely descriptive name probably will not  and the easier it will be to see a small difference in names as adequate to avoid confusion       There need not be an exact or even substantial similarity in the nature of the two businesses  The Architects  Australia    QSC   at   to   per

accepted that the elements of the modern law of passing off were summarised in Erven Warnink BV v J Townend   Sons  Hull  Ltd   AC   at   by Diplock LJ as follows      My Lords  A  G  Spalding   Bros  v  A  W  Gamage Ltd     L J Ch    and the later cases make it possible to identify five characteristics which must be present in order to create a valid cause of action for passing off    a misrepresentation   made by a trader in the course of trade    to prospective customers of his or ultimate consumers of goods or services supplied by him    which is calculated to injure the business or goodwill of another trader  in the sense that this is a reasonably foreseeable consequence  and   which causes actual damage to a business or goodwill of the trader by whom the action is brought or  in a quia timet action  will probably do so       His Lordship continued      In seeking to formulate general propositions of English law  however  one must be particularly careful to beware of the logical fallacy of the undistributed middle  It does not follow that because all passing off actions can be shown to present these characteristics  all factual situations which present these characteristics give rise to a cause of action for passing off  True it is that their presence indicates what a moral code would censure as dishonest trading  based as it is upon deception of customers and consumers of a trader s wares but in an economic system which has relied on competition to keep down prices and to improve products there may be practical reasons why it should have been the policy of the common law not to run the risk of hampering competition by providing civil remedies to every one competing in the market who has suffered damage to his business or goodwill in consequence of inaccurate statements of whatever kind that may be made by rival traders about their own wares  The market in which the action for passing off originated was no place for the mealy mouthed  advertisements are not on affidavit  exaggerated claims by a trader about the quality of his wares  assertions that they are better than those of his rivals even though he knows this to be untrue  have been permitted by the common law as venial  puffing  which gives no cause of action to a competitor even though he can show that he has suffered actual damage in his business as a result

witness by the defendant and the evidence provides no sufficient explanation of his absence       The rule is one of common sense reasoning  An unexplained failure by a party to call a witness may  in

absence       The rule is one of common sense reasoning  An unexplained failure by a party to call a witness may  in appropriate circumstances  lead to an inference that the uncalled evidence would not have assisted the case of the party who might have been expected to call the witness  Ghazal v Government Insurance Office of New South Wales     NSWLR   at   per Kirby P  A court must see that a person who has not given evidence not only could shed light on a matter  but also would ordinarily be expected to do so  RPS v The Queen   HCA   at       HCA       CLR   at   per Gaudron ACJ  Gummow  Kirby and Hayne JJ  But reliance upon Jones v Dunkel   it is considered  is of limited assistance to either the Applicants or the Third Respondent  The Applicants are correct in their submission that one or both of the two daughters could have been called to give evidence as to their involvement in the business of the Bade Medical Institute and that the accountant for that business could also have been called  Indeed  the accountant may have been able to assist in the calculation of  for example  the profits earned by that business  But it is considered that little significance is to be attached to the failure to call such witnesses  All Respondents were represented at the outset of the proceeding   but only the Third Respondent was represented at the hearing itself  The Fourth and Fifth Respondents were unrepresented and both experienced their own medical disabilities  especially the Fourth Respondent  The Fourth and Fifth Respondents conducted their cases with as much care and skill as they were able to muster  It is not considered an appropriate course to pursue   in the present case   to proceed to draw inferences based solely upon the fact that one or other possible witness was not called  Some limited significance has been attributed to the failure to call one or other of the daughters  But the preferable course  and the course in fact pursued  has been to assess what each witness said by reference to the available documentary evidence  A failure to call the   compounding pharmacist   attracts potentially different considerations  It may have been expected that the Third Respondent  being a party who was represented by both Counsel and instructing solicitors for a large part of the hearing  may have called this witness  He  again  may have been a witness who could have provided assistance as to the calculation of profits of the Bade Medical Institute  The failure of the Applicants to call Dr Vaisman also attracts different considerations  The Applicants were at all material times represented by both solicitors and Counsel  The prospect of the Third Respondent himself calling Dr Vaisman was raised during the course of a Directions hearing shortly prior to the commencement of the June   hearing  The Applicants undertook to make Dr Vaisman available to give evidence upon the Third Respondent providing an outline of the facts sought to be established  Such an outline was sought so that agreement could be reached  if possible  as to those facts which were not in dispute  Even short of such an undertaking  a course available to the Third Respondent was to issue a subpoena seeking his attendance  It remained a matter for the Third Respondent to decide whether he wished to  rely upon Jones v Dunkel and seek to gain such assistance as was possible from whatever inferences may have been available  attempt to secure agreement with the Applicants as to uncontentious facts  or simply seek leave to serve a subpoena for the attendance of Dr Vaisman   If called by the Third Respondent  Dr Vaisman could not ordinarily be cross examined by that Respondent  But no outline of the facts sought to be established was provided  The Applicants were released from the undertaking and  as events transpired  no subpoena was sought by the Third Respondent to secure Dr Vaisman s attendance  Submissions were nevertheless invited at the outset of the hearing as to the   inferences favourable   to the Respondents which it was said were available and which should be drawn by reason of the failure to call Dr Vaisman  There may perhaps be no need for a party to foreshadow at the outset of a hearing what particular inferences the Court may ultimately be invited to draw at the conclusion of the hearing  There is no necessity for a party to in effect provide at the outset an   advice on evidence   to his opponent  There may be no necessity for a party to even foreshadow that a submission will be made founded upon Jones v Dunkel   In the case where both the Applicants and the Third Respondent were represented by Counsel  the manner in which each sought to run its own case may safely be left in their hands  But the skirmish over whether Dr Vaisman was to be called or by which party ultimately assumed little relevance  Although it remained unclear what inferences the Third Respondent wanted the Court to draw by reason of the Applicants  failure to call this witness  at the end of the day it is not considered that the state of the evidence was affected by the fact that he did not give any evidence referred

the Full Court has suggested that the differences may be more apparent than real  In Allen Manufacturing Co Pty Ltd v McCallum   Co Pty Ltd   FCA       IPR   Wilcox  French and Dowsett JJ concluded        The difference between the two tests may be more apparent than read  sic   We are not aware of any case in which it has been held that a director or officer of a company directed or procured the company s infringing act  yet that person escaped liability because he or she did not deliberately  wilfully or knowingly pursue a course of conduct that was likely to constitute infringement or that reflected indifference to the risk of infringement  This may be because  in practice  an act of direction or procurement will generally meet the Mentmore test  It is notable that  in Mentmore itself  the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal declined  at   to  go so far as to hold that the director or officer must know or have reason to know that the acts which he directs or procures constitute infringement   The court declined to do this because that  would be to impose a condition of liability that does not exist for patent infringement generally        The same conclusion was reached by

McDonald s Systems of Australia Pty Ltd v McWilliams Wines Pty Ltd     ALR   at   Franki J considered the meaning of the terms   sponsorship   and   approval    His Honour there concluded as to the meaning of these two terms as follows      In Weitmann v Katies Ltd     FLR   at   I had occasion to consider the meaning of the word  sponsorship  in s  c  and I said   The word  sponsorship  in connection with trade marks or trade names seems to envisage something more along the lines of a certification mark   I see no reason to change this view and I consider that the word  sponsorship  in s  c  should be construed in a way appropriate to the construction of such a word in a section creating a criminal offence              The next question is whether there was a representation by the respondent that its wine had  approval  which it did not have      The Oxford Dictionary defines  approval  as  the action of approving  sanctioning  approbation   The most appropriate meanings of  approve  in the Oxford Dictionary are  in my opinion   to confirm authoritatively  to sanction  to pronounce to be good  commend            It has  however  been questioned whether these definitions

Court of this Court revisited the decision in Yorke   HCA         CLR   and reviewed the previous decision of this Court as to the extent of the knowledge required to make a person   knowingly concerned   in a contravention  Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Ltd v Cassidy   FCAFC       FCR    There in issue was s  GD e  of the then Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act    Cth  a provision comparable to s  B c  of the Trade Practices Act   The Court there heard two appeals  one in which the Medical Benefits Fund was the appellant  the other in which an advertising agency  Bevins  was the appellant  The primary judge accepted that Bevins did not subjectively appreciate that the advertisements involved were false  misleading or deceptive but found Bevins liable pursuant to s  GD   This conclusion was reversed on appeal  Moore J reviewed the authorities on the analogous provision here in issue  s  B   and concluded            It follows  on his Honour s findings  that Bevins  through its officers and employees  was not aware of the second of the matters  as I earlier described them  constituting the contravening conduct of MBF  That is  while Bevins was aware of what the advertisements contained  necessarily so given that it created them  it was not aware that the advertisements might lead members of the public to believe that certain benefits would be enjoyed or rights conferred by taking out insurance with MBF  Accordingly  in my opinion  his Honour erred in concluding that Bevins was liable as an accessory under s  GD             I should add that  in my opinion  liability as an accessory  in circumstances where the contravening conduct of the principal was making false or misleading representations  does not depend on an affirmative answer to the question whether the alleged accessory knew the representations were false or misleading  All that would be necessary would be for the accessory to know of the matters that enabled the representations to be characterised in that way           Mansfield J agreed with Moore J  In a separate judgment  Stone J similarly concluded        It is well established that neither knowledge nor intention is necessary for there to be a contravention of s   of the TPA or of s  GA of the ASIC Act  It is sufficient  and necessary  that the conduct in question can be accurately described as  misleading or deceptive  or  likely to mislead or deceive   This misleading or deceptive character is a question of fact that must be decided in the context of all the surrounding circumstances  Taco Co of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR   at    That  fact  is an essential element of the contravention  It follows that to be liable as an accessory one must have knowledge of the misleading and deceptive character of the relevant conduct          This is not to say that to be liable as an accessory to a strict liability breach of s   it is necessary to know that the conduct of the principal is unlawful  or indeed to have any knowledge of the provisions of the TPA or the ASIC Act  But it is necessary to know the essential elements of the contravention  by which I understand that one must know that which makes the conduct a contravention  in this case  its misleading and deceptive character  Only then can one form the intention to participate in conduct of that character      Liability of Directors and Joint TortfeasorscitedMicrosoft Corporation v Auschina Polaris Pty Ltd     FCR  The reference to the   Performing Right Society test   is a reference to Performing Right Society Ltd v Ciryl Theatrical Syndicate Ltd     KB   at   where Atkin LJ said      If the directors themselves directed or procured the commission of the act they would be liable in whatever sense they did so  whether expressly or impliedly       In Microsoft Corporation v Auschina Polaris Pty Ltd     FCR   at   to   Lindgren J said of this test      The  procured or directed  test  sometimes referred to as the  authorised  procured or directed  test  focuses attention on the relationship between the director s intention and the particular corporate conduct which the law characterises as tortious  What seems to underlie this test is the notion that  necessarily  companies can engage in tortious conduct only through human beings  and  at least ordinarily  where a particular human being involved and responsible to an appropriate extent can be identified  he should  as a matter of policy  be liable  After all  even if the aggrieved party did not sue him  apparently he would be liable to indemnify the company in respect of its liability to the aggrieved party       A director who   procures or directs   his company to perform a tortious act may thus be liable along with his company  The Architects  Australia  Pty Ltd   QSC   at   per Chesterman J citedMoorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd  No     HCA         CLR  http www

Thereafter  however  there have emerged two lines of authority such that the path to be followed remains unclear  In Cooper v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd   FCAFC       FCR     Kenny J expressed these two lines of authority as follows        The law concerning the liability of directors and other officers for corporate wrongdoings is unclear  see Allen Manufacturing Company Pty Ltd v McCallum   Company Pty Ltd     IPR   at     per Wilcox  French and Dowsett JJ   Allen Manufacturing    There are two relevant lines of authority  each supportive of a different test  As the Full Court said in Allen Manufacturing   IPR at             One line supported     the   Performing Right Society test  whether the director had  directed or procured  the company s infringement  The other line supported  the Mentmore test  whether the director had engaged in  the deliberate  wilful and knowing pursuit of a course of conduct that was likely to constitute infringement or reflected an indifference to the risk of it               No Full Court of this Court has settled which of these two tests is to be preferred  see Allen Manufacturing   IPR at     and Sydneywide Distributors Pty

  Finkelstein J discussed both tests and concluded at   that  t he director s conduct must be such that it can be said of him that he was so personally involved in the commission of the unlawful act that it is just that he should be rendered liable   I tend to agree with his Honour s approach  compare also Universal Music   FCA       FCR   at         Branson J did not express a preference for either test and the remaining member of the Court  French J  simply agreed with the conclusion of Branson and Kenny JJ that the appeal should be dismissed  The reference to the   Performing Right Society test   is a reference to Performing Right Society Ltd v Ciryl Theatrical Syndicate Ltd     KB   at   where Atkin LJ said      If the directors themselves directed or procured the commission of the act they would be liable in whatever sense they did so  whether expressly or impliedly       In Microsoft Corporation v Auschina Polaris Pty Ltd     FCR   at   to   Lindgren J said of this test      The  procured or directed  test  sometimes referred to as the  authorised  procured or directed  test  focuses attention on the relationship between the director s intention and the particular corporate conduct which the law characterises as tortious  What seems to underlie this test is the notion that  necessarily  companies can engage in tortious conduct only through human beings  and  at least ordinarily  where a particular human being involved and responsible to an appropriate extent can be identified  he should  as a matter of policy  be liable  After all  even if the aggrieved party did not sue him  apparently he would be liable to indemnify the company in respect of its liability to the aggrieved party       A director who   procures or directs   his company to perform a tortious act may thus be liable along with his company  The Architects  Australia  Pty Ltd   QSC   at   per Chesterman J citedIn re Powell s Trade Mark     Ch  A   trade mark   is defined by s   of

      FLR         Where particular evidence  or types of evidence  can be identified as having been deliberately or recklessly lost  or destroyed  or not disclosed  this gives rise to a presumption at least that the contents of that evidence would have been entirely against the defaulting party in accordance with the maxim omnia praesumuntur contra spoliatorem  which has been translated as  all things are presumed against the wrongdoer  per Mozley and Whitley s Law Dictionary as cited in NWR FM t as North West Radio v Broadcasting Commission of Ireland   IEHC     It is difficult to find a use of spoliator as  wrongdoer  in any except the most recent authorities  many of which cite Mozley   A more precise translation of the Latin word might be  robber  pillager  plunderer or spoiler  which accords with the maxim s usage in the older authorities             The High Court in Allen v Tobias   HCA         CLR   at   adopted the statement of this maxim given in The Ophelia     AC             If any one by a deliberate act destroys a document which  according to what its contents may have been  would have told strongly either for him or against him  the strongest possible presumption arises that if it had been produced it would have told against him  and even if the document is destroyed by his own act  but under circumstances in which the intention to destroy evidence may fairly be considered rebutted  still he has to suffer  He is in the position that he is without the corroboration which might have been expected in his case         Her Honour there went on to observe at   that there is a divergence as to the amount of   wrongdoing   or fault required to enliven the maxim   namely  whether it is necessary to establish some malus animus or mala fide or whether it is sufficient to establish that it cannot be shown that the destruction of evidence was proper or justifiable  The written submissions filed on behalf of the Third Respondent deny that the non production of documents was as great or as flagrant as contended by the Applicants  The non production of documents assumes perhaps most relevance when attention is focussed upon the manner in which the Applicants sought to quantify their loss or damage or lost profits  That evidence was self evidently less than what may have been desirable  But the evidence was sufficient to make out the case and to support the findings sought by the Applicants  It was thus unnecessary to resolve any submission as to documents which may have been available but not produced  Mr Gambell and his

CLR   at           any inference favourable to the plaintiff for which there was ground in the evidence might be more confidently drawn when a person presumably able to put the true complexion on the facts relied on as the ground for the inference has not been called as a witness by the defendant and the evidence provides no sufficient explanation of his absence       The rule is one of common sense reasoning  An unexplained failure by a party to call a witness may  in appropriate circumstances  lead to an inference that the uncalled evidence would not have assisted the case of the party

In SAP Australia Pty Ltd   FCA       ALR     French  Heerey and Lindgren JJ thus observed  citations omitted            it was rightly observed that misleading or deceptive conduct in trade or commerce is not limited to conduct which induces or is likely to induce entry into a transaction  So to propose would be to limit s   of the TP Act in a way not justified by its terms  Conduct which misleads a customer so that  under some mistaken impression of a trader s connection or affiliation  he or she opens negotiations or invites approaches may be misleading or deceptive even if the true position emerges before the transaction is concluded          In reaching these conclusions  one of the decisions relied upon by their Honours was the earlier decision of Beaumont J in TEC   Tomas  Australia  Pty Ltd v Matsumiya Computer Company Pty Ltd     FCR   at   to    His Honour there recognised as follows that misleading conduct at the outset may be a   door opener       The fact that  Seiko  is a household name  at least in respect of watches  confirmed by the experience of the respondents that the name  Seiko  has been a  door opener  in marketing terms  indicates that a potential purchaser of computers may well commence to deal with the respondents in circumstances where he would not have done so if the respondents had made no mention of  Seiko  in its trade or business name and in advertising  In my view  to induce the introduction of such a dealing is conduct which contravenes s   even if  ultimately  the consumer becomes aware that the equipment he is purchasing is not that of the Hattori Seiko group  the deception having occurred at an earlier stage  what is relevantly induced is the dealing or the negotiations  as distinct from the subsequent purchase itself  As Taco s case held  there is no reason why s   cannot apply to the earlier inducement  even if  as Puxu s case held  the conduct in respect of the purchase itself does not offend s   because  by then  the consumer knows or ought to have known that he is purchasing a product other than that of the Hattori Seiko group citedSelect Personnel Pty Ltd v Morgan   Banks Pty Ltd     IPR  There need not be

Court of this Court revisited the decision in Yorke   HCA         CLR   and reviewed the previous decision of this Court as to the extent of the knowledge required to make a person   knowingly concerned   in a contravention  Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Ltd v Cassidy   FCAFC       FCR    There in issue was s  GD e  of the then Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act    Cth  a provision comparable to s  B c  of the Trade Practices Act   The Court there heard two appeals  one in which the Medical Benefits Fund was the appellant  the other in which an advertising agency  Bevins  was the appellant  The primary judge accepted that Bevins did not subjectively appreciate that the advertisements involved were false  misleading or deceptive but found Bevins liable pursuant to s  GD   This conclusion was reversed on appeal  Moore J reviewed the authorities on the analogous provision here in issue  s  B   and concluded            It follows  on his Honour s findings  that Bevins  through its officers and employees  was not aware of the second of the matters  as I earlier described them  constituting the contravening conduct of MBF  That is  while Bevins was aware of what the advertisements contained  necessarily so given that it created them  it was not aware that the advertisements might lead members of the public to believe that certain benefits would be enjoyed or rights conferred by taking out insurance with MBF  Accordingly  in my opinion  his Honour erred in concluding that Bevins was liable as an accessory under s  GD             I should add that  in my opinion  liability as an accessory  in circumstances where the contravening conduct of the principal was making false or misleading representations  does not depend on an affirmative answer to the question whether the alleged accessory knew the representations were false or misleading  All that would be necessary would be for the accessory to know of the matters that enabled the representations to be characterised in that way           Mansfield J agreed with Moore J  In a separate judgment  Stone J similarly concluded        It is well established that neither knowledge nor intention is necessary for there to be a contravention of s   of the TPA or of s  GA of the ASIC Act  It is sufficient  and necessary  that the conduct in question can be accurately described as  misleading or deceptive  or  likely to mislead or deceive   This misleading or deceptive character is a question of fact that must be decided in the context of all the surrounding circumstances  Taco Co of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR   at    That  fact  is an essential element of the contravention  It follows that to be liable as an accessory one must have knowledge of the misleading and deceptive character of the relevant conduct          This is not to say that to be liable as an accessory to a strict liability breach of s   it is necessary to know that the conduct of the principal is unlawful  or indeed to have any knowledge of the provisions of the TPA or the ASIC Act  But it is necessary to know the essential elements of the contravention  by which I understand that one must know that which makes the conduct a contravention  in this case  its misleading and deceptive character  Only then can one form the intention to participate in conduct of that character      Liability of Directors and Joint Tortfeasors In this respect  it may be that there is a further distinction between passing off and s    For the purposes of passing off  it may be that deception must continue to the   point of sale    Whether or not there is such a requirement in respect to the tort  s   does not impose any such constraint  Taco Co of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR    Deane and Fitzgerald JJ there observed      It is  in the circumstances  unnecessary that we form or express any concluded view on the question whether it is a principle of the law of passing off that deception must continue  or be likely to continue  to the  point of sale   As a matter of principle and of logic  it is difficult to see why it should be  For the purposes of the present appeal  it suffices to say that  even if such a limitation should be recognized in the law of passing off  we see no ground for importing it into the provisions of s   of the Act  In our view  it is sufficient to enliven s   that the conduct  in the circumstances  answers the statutory description  that is to say  that it is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive  It is unnecessary to go further and establish that any actual or potential consumer has taken or is likely to take any positive step in consequence of the misleading or deception  That is not to say that evidence of actual misleading or deception at the point of sale and of steps taken in consequence thereof is not likely to be both relevant and important on the question whether the relevant conduct in fact answers the statutory description and as to the relief  if any  which should be granted  In the circumstances of the present proceeding  it is considered that such disclaimers as were used are not sufficient to negate a conclusion that the conduct engaged in by the Bade Medical Institute which has been found to contravene s   remained   misleading or deceptive    Even if  in limited instances  the   true position   may have emerged such that in a limited number of cases consumers may have realised that the Bade Medical Institute was   not associated with AMI Advanced Medical Institute   its conduct remained misleading and deceptive and such as to occasion loss or damage to the Applicants  Although the evidence of Dr Beaini was that he was   insisting   upon a disclaimer being used  there is in any event considerable uncertainty as to when any disclaimer first appeared and how uniformly it was being used  Such further evidence as Dr Beaini did give in cross examination only reinforced the conclusion that consumers were being misled  One exchange was as follows  when Dr Beaini was being asked questions as to his involvement in the preparation of a   business plan       Did you prepare any business plan for Bade Medical Institute    No   Never participated in the formulation of any business plan whatsoever

any of those possibilities  Dr Beaini  in relation to the development and marketing of the Bade Medical Institute    My involvement was basically getting the medical information out  There was an occasional issue where they would ask me my opinion  For example  they were getting some calls  people asking them if they were AMI and I said we should have it on our website that we re not  Because a lot of people wanted refunds and they were dissatisfied with AMI products  That was a joint agreement to have   We are not AMI  on our website  so we wouldn t have to deal with that  My   and basically my role was to work with other products and expanding our product range  because we wanted to do something called Bade Online Pharmacy  which was going to sell different vitamins and insomnia products and lasers and Botox treatments and things like that  So they were the sort of business dealings that we had     But when any disclaimer was used and in what form of advertising remained unclear  It is concluded that the contraventions of ss   and    d  of the Trade Practices Act have occasioned the Applicants   loss or damage    The Applicants have suffered   loss or damage by conduct   that has contravened those provisions  In relation to passing off  the Applicants seek either damages or an account of profits  While it is a matter for an applicant to elect between these remedies  in the present proceeding it matters not which remedy is sought as the quantum to which the Applicants are entitled is the same appliedTEC   Tomas  Australia  Pty Ltd v Matsumiya Computer Company Pty Ltd     FCR  In SAP Australia Pty Ltd   FCA       ALR     French  Heerey and Lindgren JJ thus observed  citations omitted            it was rightly observed that misleading or deceptive conduct in trade or commerce is not limited to conduct which induces or is likely to induce entry into a transaction  So to propose would be to limit s   of the TP Act in a way not justified by its terms  Conduct which misleads a customer so that  under some mistaken impression of a trader s connection or affiliation  he or she opens negotiations or invites approaches may be misleading or deceptive even if the true position emerges before the transaction is concluded          In reaching these conclusions  one of the decisions relied upon by their Honours was the earlier decision of Beaumont J in TEC   Tomas  Australia  Pty Ltd v Matsumiya Computer Company Pty Ltd     FCR   at   to    His Honour there recognised as follows that misleading conduct at the outset may be a   door opener       The fact that  Seiko  is a household name  at least in respect of watches  confirmed by the experience of the respondents that the name  Seiko  has been a  door opener  in marketing terms  indicates that a potential purchaser of computers may well commence to deal with the respondents in circumstances where he would not have done so if the respondents had made no mention of  Seiko  in its trade or business name and in advertising  In my view  to induce the introduction of such a dealing is conduct which contravenes s   even if  ultimately  the consumer becomes aware that the equipment he is purchasing is not that of the Hattori Seiko group  the deception having occurred at an earlier stage  what is relevantly induced is the dealing or the negotiations  as distinct from the subsequent purchase itself  As Taco s case held  there is no reason why s   cannot apply to the earlier inducement  even if  as Puxu s case held  the conduct in respect of the purchase itself does not offend s   because  by then  the consumer knows or ought to have known that he is purchasing a product other than that of the Hattori Seiko group appliedThompson v Australian Capital Television

written Outline of Submissions states in part         The language is clear and unambiguous and there were no reservations in relation to the orders sought or included in the consent orders             The effect of those orders is that the respondents agreed to permanent injunctions  and thus foreclose any argument before the Court now that liability is denied       In support of their submission  the Applicants relied upon the following observations of Gibbs CJ  Stephen  Mason and Wilson JJ in Thomson Australian Holdings Pty Ltd v The Trade Practices Commission   HCA         CLR   at       In deciding whether consent orders sought are in conformity with legal principle the Court is entitled to treat the defendants  consent as involving an admission of all facts necessary or appropriate to the granting of the relief sought       The orders there in issue were orders giving effect to terms of settlement  They were final orders  The difficulty confronting the Applicants  however  is that notwithstanding that all Respondents consented to the orders made in December   granting injunctive relief  those orders were made   until further order    The order as then made was not a   permanent injunction   as contended by the Applicants  There may well be reasons why a respondent may not wish to oppose interlocutory relief at the outset of a proceeding but may seek to preserve an entitlement to defend the proceeding at a final hearing  Consent to the grant of interlocutory relief cannot be construed as an admission of all facts necessary to establish liability at a final hearing  To contend otherwise would be a submission without substance  It was for that reason that no reliance was ultimately placed by the Applicants upon the grant of the injunctive relief  This way in which the Applicants sought to advance their submission is thus rejected  The   orders do not have the conclusive effect they assert    Reservation   is expressed on the face of those orders in that the orders are not   permanent injunctions    The interlocutory nature of the relief  it is thus considered  does not preclude any of the Respondents from now denying liability citedTotalizator

Investments Pty Ltd v Lane Industries Pty Ltd   FCA         IPR   at   per Gummow  French and Hill JJ  For present purposes  however  it may be accepted that the elements of the modern law of passing off were summarised in Erven Warnink BV v J Townend   Sons  Hull  Ltd   AC   at   by Diplock LJ as follows      My Lords  A  G  Spalding   Bros  v  A  W  Gamage Ltd     L J Ch    and the later cases make it possible to identify five characteristics which must be present in order to create a valid cause of action for passing off    a misrepresentation   made by a trader in the course of trade    to prospective customers of his or ultimate consumers of goods or services supplied by him    which is calculated to injure the business or goodwill of another trader  in the sense that this is a reasonably foreseeable consequence  and   which causes actual damage to a business or goodwill of the trader by whom the action is brought or  in a quia timet action  will probably do so       His Lordship continued      In seeking to formulate general propositions of English law  however  one must be particularly careful to beware of the logical fallacy of the undistributed middle  It does not follow that because all passing off actions can be shown to present these characteristics  all factual situations which present these characteristics give rise to a cause of action for passing off  True it is that their presence indicates what a moral code would censure as dishonest trading  based as it is upon deception of customers and consumers of a trader s wares but in an economic system which has relied on competition to keep down prices and to improve products there may be practical reasons why it should have been the policy of the common law not to run the risk of hampering competition by providing civil remedies to every one competing in the market who has suffered damage to his business or goodwill in consequence of inaccurate statements of whatever kind that may be made by rival traders about their own wares  The market in which the action for passing off originated was no place for the mealy mouthed  advertisements are not on affidavit  exaggerated claims by a trader about the quality of his wares  assertions that they are better than those of his rivals even though he knows this to be untrue  have been permitted by the common law as venial  puffing  which gives no cause of action to a competitor even though he can show that he has suffered actual damage in his business as a result       Lord Fraser of Tullybelton expressed perhaps a narrower statement

Corporation Ltd     FCR   at    citations omitted      Where the infringer is a corporation questions frequently arise as to the degree of involvement on the part of directors necessary for them to be

comparison undertaken for the purposes of resolving whether the use of a mark is   deceptively similar   for the purposes of s   of the Trade Marks Act   Wingate Marketing Pty Ltd v Levi Strauss   Co     FCR    Gummow J there observed at       Where the comparison of the marks is necessary to determine whether that of the defendant is deceptively similar to the registered mark of the plaintiff  who sues for infringement  the primary comparison must be between the registered mark on the one hand and the mark as used by the defendant on the other  The comparison differs from that in a passing off action where the plaintiff points to the goodwill built up around the mark by reason of prior use and then points to the conduct of the defendant as leading to deception  or perhaps merely confusion  and consequent damage to that goodwill of the plaintiff  No relief is sought as against the First or Second Respondents  Liability is  however  sought to be established as against the Third  Fourth and Fifth Respondents  That liability is said by the Applicants to arise by reason of either  s  B of the Trade Practices Act   in the event that there is a contravention of ss   or   of that Act  or

effect the contravention         In order to fall within s  B a  it is necessary to prove that a person was aware or ought to have been aware of the facts that gave rise to the contravention and to prove that he intentionally participated in the contravention  But it is not necessary to prove that the person knew that his participation was a breach of the Act  Quinlivan v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCA       FCR   Yorke v Lucas   HCA         CLR   at   to   per Mason ACJ  Wilson  Deane and Dawson JJ  The particular provision invoked by the Applicants in the present proceeding is s  B c   Their Honours in Yorke further relevantly observed at   that      There can be no question that a person cannot be knowingly concerned in a contravention unless he has knowledge of the essential facts constituting the contravention      In our view  the proper construction of par   c  requires a party to a contravention to be an intentional participant  the necessary intent being based upon knowledge of the essential elements of the contravention       The Respondent to that proceeding  Lucas  was not liable as an accessory as he did not know that the information he was giving to the prospective purchaser was false  He lacked knowledge of an essential element of the contravention  The authorities and the   controversy   as to the extent of knowledge necessary to bring a person within s  B have been discussed in Pearce M   Accessorial Liability for Misleading or Deceptive Conduct      ALJ    A Full Court of this Court revisited the decision in Yorke   HCA         CLR   and reviewed the previous decision of this Court as to the extent of the knowledge required to make a person   knowingly concerned   in a contravention  Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Ltd v Cassidy   FCAFC       FCR    There in issue was s  GD e  of the then Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act    Cth  a provision comparable to s  B c  of the Trade Practices Act   The Court there heard two appeals  one in which the Medical Benefits Fund was the appellant  the other in which an advertising agency  Bevins  was the appellant  The primary judge accepted that Bevins did not subjectively appreciate that the advertisements involved were false  misleading or deceptive but found Bevins liable pursuant to s  GD   This conclusion was reversed on appeal  Moore J reviewed the authorities on the analogous provision here in issue  s  B   and concluded            It follows  on his Honour s findings  that Bevins  through its officers and employees  was not aware of the second of the matters  as I earlier described them  constituting the contravening conduct of MBF  That is  while Bevins was aware of what the advertisements contained  necessarily so given that it created them  it was not aware that the advertisements might lead members of the public to believe that certain benefits would be enjoyed or rights conferred by taking out insurance with MBF  Accordingly  in my opinion  his Honour erred in concluding that Bevins was liable as an accessory under s  GD             I should add that  in my opinion  liability as an accessory  in circumstances where the contravening conduct of the principal was making false or misleading representations  does not depend on an affirmative answer to the question whether the alleged accessory knew the representations were false or misleading  All that would be necessary would be for the accessory to know of the matters that enabled the representations to be characterised in that way           Mansfield J agreed with Moore J  In a separate judgment  Stone J similarly concluded        It is well established that neither knowledge nor intention is necessary for there to be a contravention of s   of the TPA or of s  GA of the ASIC Act  It is sufficient  and necessary  that the conduct in question can be accurately described as  misleading or deceptive  or  likely to mislead or deceive   This misleading or deceptive character is a question of fact that must be decided in the context of all the surrounding circumstances  Taco Co of Australia Inc v Taco Bell Pty Ltd   FCA         ALR   at    That  fact  is an essential element of the contravention  It follows that to be liable as an accessory one must have knowledge of the misleading and deceptive character of the relevant conduct          This is not to say that to be liable as an accessory to a strict liability breach of s   it is necessary to know that the conduct of the principal is unlawful  or indeed to have any knowledge of the provisions of the TPA or the ASIC Act  But it is necessary to know the essential elements of the contravention  by which I understand that one must know that which makes the conduct a contravention  in this case  its misleading and deceptive character  Only then can one form the intention to participate in conduct of that character      Liability of Directors and Joint Tortfeasors
