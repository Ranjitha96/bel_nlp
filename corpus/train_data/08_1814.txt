Full Court in Jess v Scott     FCR   consideredJohnston v Comcare   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The present case nicely illustrates the point  The refusal by the Federal Magistrates Court on   November   to set aside the order of dismissal made on   October   and to reopen the proceeding for the judicial review of the Tribunal s decision did not have the legal effect of finally determining as between the Applicant and the Minister the merits of that proceeding  However  the practical effect of the refusal to reopen was to leave in place the order of dismissal of the challenge to the Tribunal s decision  That  in turn  had the practical effect of leaving standing the decision of the Tribunal affirming the refusal to grant the Applicant a protection visa  An appreciation of the practical effect that some  strictly interlocutory judgments may nonetheless have led Branson J in Johnston v Comcare   FCAFC         FCR   at   to observe that leave to appeal is more readily granted where a decision  if allowed to stand  will have  the practical effect  of determining a claim of an applicant to be entitled to an order  rather than in a case concerning practice and procedure only  I have approached the question of whether to grant leave in this case with this sentiment in mind citedNACA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs

special reasons  to be shown  In that regard  the Full Court drew attention to the observations which had been made in relation to that requirement by an earlier Full Court in Jess v Scott     FCR     The Full Court in Nguyen seems to have been of the view that it would be incongruous not to adopt a similar approach to the granting of an extension of time within which to apply for leave to appeal to that required in relation to the granting of an extension of time within which to appeal  That said  the Full Court  at   rejected the adoption of any narrow  pedantic approach to the granting of an extension of time  In the circumstances of that case  the Full Court regarded it as preferable to deal with the application by reference to the prospects of any appeal rather than by considering whether such delay as had occurred justified the refusing of an extension of time citedSZJGV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The Applicant also handed up and stated that she wished to rely upon a letter dated   November   addressed to the Court  For the purposes of the leave to appeal application the relevance of the letter is that it signifies a request on the part of the Applicant to add a further ground to the bases upon which  were leave granted  the appeal against the Federal Magistrate s decision would be prosecuted  Materially  the letter reads  More importantly I attach a copy of the Federal Court decision of SZJGV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC     and highlighted sections of my RRT decision on   January    I have been informed that the RRT appears to have erred and made an error of law in taking into account my Falun Gong activities in Australia  Mention of these Australian activities also made in the Federal Magistrates Court decision  see attached    sic   Attention was drawn by highlighting to particular passages in the attachments   I mean no disrespect to the Applicant in observing that  though the letter is signed by her  it exhibits a standard of literacy in English and forensic sophistication quite beyond her  having regard to my observations of her at the November and earlier hearings  That is not in any way to gainsay her ability to seek to rely upon it   Mr Baird of the solicitors for the Minister  whose conduct of the case for the Minister on the hearing of the application and on earlier occasions gave practical exemplification to the letter and spirit of the model litigant obligations promulgated by the Attorney General in Appendix B to the Legal Services Directions made pursuant to s  ZF of the Judiciary Act    Cth  had been made aware of the contents of this letter prior to the hearing being called on  On behalf of the Minister he did not object to the passage quoted in the letter being treated as an additional foreshadowed basis of challenge with whether to grant leave to appeal ought to be granted being determined accordingly  This seemed to me to be an appropriate course to take  I directed that the letter and its attachments be marked as Exhibit   so as to identify them  Because the letter identifies the Applicant s name and having regard to s  X of the Migration Act   I also directed that these materials be a confidential exhibit   In SZJGV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC         ALR   the Full Court held that this subsection first required a decision maker to make findings of fact as to the conduct  if any  in which a visa applicant had engaged in Australia  Having so done and if it is found that the visa applicant has engaged in conduct in Australia  s  R  had the effect  so the Full Court decided  that the decision maker must for all purposes disregard the person s conduct in Australia  unless the person satisfies the decision maker that he or she has engaged in the conduct in Australia otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening the person s claim to be a refugee  The statutory command to disregard was all embracing  so it was held  with it constituting a breach of s  R  and an error of law for conduct in Australia to be taken into account for the purpose of assessing whether or to what extent to accept the credibility of a visa applicant s claim in respect of events said by that person to have occurred outside Australia   Should the Applicant s belated raising of an asserted violation of s  R  of the Migration Act make any difference to this outcome  As in SZJGV   no point concerning s  R  was taken before the Federal Magistrates Court on   November   although the learned Magistrate did observe  at   that   jurisdictional error is not apparent in relation to the Tribunal s decision    There are passages in the reasons of the Tribunal which arguably do evidence that the Tribunal s findings concerning the Applicant s activities in Australia influenced conclusions reached by the Tribunal concerning the Applicant s credibility generally and in particular whether or not she had practised Falun Gong in China  I set out these passages below  I asked the applicant when she learned to do the five exercises and she said before    I repeated the question and she said    I asked how often she did the exercises between   and   and she said  Very little  sometimes once a week or once a fortnight  She said that after   she did the exercises once a week  She said that she does the exercises in Australia  sometimes  sometimes once in half a month or a month  She does them at her home  I put to her that most practitioners I had spoken to exercise more frequently  She replied that everyone is different   I asked whether being a Falun Gong practitioner involved anything other than performing the exercised  She asked whether I meant in China or in Australia  She said that in Australia she takes part in  activities   These activities consist of a parade at Town Hall stationer once a month  I asked the purpose of this parade  and she said that Falun Gong practitioners get together to hold activities  She said that she does not do any other Falun Gong activities in Australia  She then added that sometimes there is a parade in Chinatown  I asked what happens at these parades and she said that they take photos and distribute materials  I asked what the purposes of taking photos was  and she said that the other practitioners take photos maybe they have lodged protection visa applications as well    I asked the applicant about the content of the Falun Gong materials that she distributes  She said  I forget   I asked whether she could tell me anything about the materials at all  but she said that she cannot remember  I asked whether she has any Falun Gong materials at home  She said that she is not sure  I asked whether she has any books about Falun Gong  She said that she does not  and that she has not seen any books about Falun Gong  I then asked her the name of the founder of Falun Gong  which she knew  and asked whether he had written any booked  She replied that he had written Zhuan Falun  She said that she had read this book before  but now she forgets what it is about  She read it in China in    She read it  roughly  at her home  She did not know whether Master Li had written other books  she only read that one book  I asked her what Falun Dafa means and she said that she does not know  nor did she know that a Falun is          I asked the application what it would to her if she was unable to practise Falun Gong any more  She said that this was impossible because she is addicted to Falun Gong  I put to her that she only practised once a week  She replied that this is what she likes to do  It would be impossible for her not to do this it is beneficial to her health          I asked her to tell me anything at all about the material she distributes and she said that she does not know anything  She said that she has forgotten what was written on the pieces of paper she handed out  I asked why she handed out this material and she said that because she is a Falun Gong practitioner  sometimes she needs to distribute this material  I asked by Falun Gong practitioners need to do this and she replied that they ask other people to practise Falun Gong  I asked why she had taken photos of herself handing out this material and she said that the photos were her  material   I asked the application about the purpose of a demonstration depicted in one of the photos she submitted  and she said that it was to let other people know that they were Falun Gong practitioners  I asked about a banner that she was standing in front of in one of the photos  concerning organ harvesting  and asked what it was about  She said that she had forgotten          I put to the applicant that in view of her lack of knowledge of Falun Gong I did not think that she was a genuinely committed practitioner  Further  it seemed to me that the Falun Gong activities that she had engaged in  in Australia were done for the purpose of strengthening her claims to refugee status  as she demonstrated so little understanding of Falun Gong  The applicant did not respond         I found the applicant to be a highly unsatisfactory witness  For most of the hearing she appeared to be deliberately attempting to avoid answering my questions  Many questions had to be repeated several times before she gave a meaningful answer  From the outset  when I asked her when she started to practise Falun Gong  she provided contradictory and inconsistent answers  saying at first that it was in   then that it was  in the  s  and then that it was in    When asked to resolve this contradictory evidence  she said that she took up  formal  practice after   but was then unable to explain what she meant by this term  or to specify how her practice was different before and after      The applicant was able to demonstrate some knowledge of some aspects of Falun Gong  for example  the names of the exercises  the name of the founder  and the fact that practitioners are supposed to be good people and do good deeds  She was also able to demonstrate one exercise  I note  however  that this basic factual information is readily available  for example  on the Falun Gong website  Moreover  the applicant claims to practise Falun Gong  very little  in both the PRC and in Australia  providing vague and inconsistent responses as to precisely how often  ranging from once a week to once a month          I do not consider that the applicant displayed the level of knowledge of Falun Gong that could reasonably be expected of a practitioner of at least five years standing  who has had the opportunity to practise both inside and outside China  Having considered the oral evidence presented by the applicant at the hearing  I am not satisfied that she is now  or was prior to her departure from the PRC  a Falun Gong practitioner  The applicant s lack of knowledge of the spiritual and theoretical beliefs of Falun Gong leads me to conclude that she is not a Falun Gong practitioner  Because I do not accept that the applicant is now  or ever was a Falun Gong practitioner  I do not accept that she came to the attention of the PSB prior to her departure  or that she was ever detained in the PRC as a Falun Gong practitioner    The applicant claims to practise Falun Gong in Australia alone at home  once a week  just as she claims to have done in the PRC  The main  Falun Gong activity  in which she claims to engage in Australia is distributing Falun Gong material  However  she was unable to tell me anything about the content of the material which she claims to distribute  Nor was she able to tell me the purpose of demonstrations in which she claims to have participated  and in which she submitted photographs of herself standing in front of a banner referring to persecution of Falun Gong practitioners in China  In view of her apparent lack of knowledge or understanding of the material she claims to distribute  or the purpose of demonstrations in which she claims to have participated  I am satisfied that  to the extent that the applicant has engaged in these activities in Australia  this is not done out of a genuine commitment to Falun Gong  but rather  to strengthen her claim to be a refugee  Accordingly  this conduct must be disregarded  pursuant to s  R  of the Act   In all the circumstances  I do not accept that the applicant was a Falun Gong practitioner in the PRC or that she came to the adverse attention of the authorities as such prior to her departure  I am not satisfied that she has carried out Falun Gong related activities in Australia out of genuine commitment to Falun Gong  As I do not accept that the applicant is a genuine or committed Falun Gong practitioner  there is not reason  based on the credible evidence before me  to suppose that she should seek to practise Falun Gong it she were to return to the PRC  In these circumstances I am not satisfied that the applicant has a well founded fear or persecution in the PRC as a Falun Gong practitioner   On the hearing of the application I queried whether or not in the circumstances of this case the interests of justice might be served by treating argument on the application for extension of time and leave as argument on any appeal and determining the appeal instanter in the event that the procedural application was successful  The Minister did not raise any objection to that course  although his representative had not  given the shortness of notice by the Applicant as to a desire to rely upon a s  R  point  had the opportunity to confirm whether an application for special leave to appeal had been made in respect of the Full Court s decision in SZJGV   I was informed earlier in the week by counsel appearing on behalf of the Minister in another case that an application for special leave had been instituted and remained pending  That this was the position was confirmed having regard to available lists published by the High Court with respect to pending special leave applications   It seems to me preferable not to put the position with respect to whether there has been a breach of s  R  by the Tribunal any higher at the present than  arguable   That it is arguable and the potential consequences for the Applicant in the event that an extension of time and leave to appeal were refused dispose me  as a matter of discretion  to extend time and to grant leave to appeal  Upon reflection  the better course  it seems to me  given that a special leave application is pending  is not to proceed to determine the appeal  To allow that appeal on the strength of the applicability of what was said of s  R  by the Full Court in SZJGV and to return the case to the Tribunal may be to proceed on what proves to be a false legal premise  On the other hand  if special leave is refused or an appeal against the decision in SZJGV is dismissed  the appeal in this case would be able to be heard relatively quickly  It seems to me preferable to await the disposal  one way or the other  of proceedings in the High Court in SZJGV   I expressly refrain from reaching any concluded view as to whether there has been a breach of s  R    I dispense with the requirement that an application for leave to appeal be filed within   days of the date of pronouncement of the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court on   November   and instead extend the time for the filing of the application for leave to appeal to   December    A grant of leave to appeal should be granted to the Applicant but it should though be restricted to an appeal on the following ground  as derived from the s  R  point sought to be raised in the letter of   November   and that agitated in SZJGV   The Federal Magistrates Court erred in concluding that no jurisdictional error was apparent in the Refugee Review Tribunal s decision in that the Tribunal had erred by having regard to the conduct of the appellant in Australia when determining her application for a protection visa  In so doing  the Tribunal failed to comply with the stipulation  made in s  R  of the Migration Act    Cth  that such conduct must be disregarded   Because the Applicant is not legally represented  I note that the effect of O   r  a ii  is that she must file and serve a notice of appeal expressing the ground upon which leave to appeal is granted within   days after today  ie not later than Monday   December     It remains to make some brief comment about the position in which the Applicant claimed to find herself so far as her visa status was concerned in the interval between the August and November hearings  I directed that a copy of the transcript of the hearing on   November   be prepared and made available to the Minister s legal representatives with the Minister then making such response as he may be advised by   November as to the allegations made by the Applicant  I did so because  if accepted  the Applicant s allegations raised the spectre of possible interference by officers of the Executive Government with the Applicant s ability freely to prosecute her application and appear on its hearing on   November    A response on behalf of the Minister was received on   November    It seems to me that the response ought to be marked as an exhibit but  because it names the Applicant  that it ought to be a confidential exhibit and be placed in a sealed envelope marked  Minister s response to Applicant s allegations concerning visa dealings  and  Not to be opened without the leave of a court or a judge  citedSZKCE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  On   December   the Applicant filed in this Court an application entitled  Extension of Time to file and serve a Notice of Appeal   It is apparent from that document that the Applicant wishes to challenge the decision on   November   by the Federal Magistrates Court to decline to set aside the earlier order of that Court dismissing her judicial review application  In an earlier interlocutory judgment in this matter  which I delivered on   March     SZKCE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   at     I observed  The Minister  in his written submissions  submits that the correct characterisation for the application of   December is that of an application for leave to appeal against a pre hearing judgment  It seems to me that that is the correct way to regard the application of   December    The Minister  very properly  does not seek to make any adverse issue of the form of the application  but  instead  has proceeded on the basis that it is an application for leave to appeal   I proceed therefore on the basis that the application is  in substance  an application for leave to appeal from the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court given on   November    Strictly speaking  the application also carries with it an application for the dispensing of the time within which an application for leave to appeal ought ordinarily to be filed  O   r  a  Federal Court Rules   That is because the application was filed more than   days after the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court was pronounced   After   March   a series of adjournments of the hearing of the application followed  for reasons which in the very particular circumstances of this case seemed to me to be warranted  for the purpose of enabling the Applicant to have the benefit of legal advice from the McArthur Legal Centre  a community legal centre based at Campbelltown in New South Wales  I gave reasons at the time for the granting of these adjournments  It is not necessary to repeat them  In the result  the application came on for hearing before me in the immigration appeals list in Sydney on   November     When the application was called on for hearing in November the Applicant first made a statement about her experiences with officials of the Department in relation to the extension of her existing visa in the interval between when the application was last before the Court in August this year and the present hearing  As was correctly submitted on behalf of the Minister  whatever may have occurred in this regard  and there was no suggestion that the solicitors firm presently acting for the Minister was involved  that was not relevant to the question of whether leave to appeal ought to be granted  It will though be necessary to make some observations on the subject later in these reasons appliedVAAC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  In VAAC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at     in relation to the allowing of a new ground to be argued on appeal which was not raised below  It was there stated        It is therefore necessary to consider whether it is expedient in the interests of justice to allow the new ground to be argued and determined  In the present case  the interests of justice require reference to a number of considerations  namely  the appellant s prospects of success on the appeal on the new argument  the explanation given by the appellant for failing to raise the argument before the primary judge  the prejudice to the respondent in allowing the appellant to raise the new argument  the potentially serious consequences to the appellant if leave to amend is refused  and the integrity of the appellate process     In this case  because the practical effect of an extension of time and a grant of leave to appeal would be to permit the Applicant to raise a ground not raised below it seems to me that each of the considerations mentioned in VAAC is pertinent to the exercise of the discretions to extend time and grant leave to appeal  Here  there is no question of any evidentiary embarrassment to the Minister were a s  R  ground to be permitted to be raised and no other possible prejudice is evident  If the Applicant s claim for a protection visa was indeed not dealt with according to law by the Tribunal then  given the nature of her claim  there are potentially serious consequences for her in the event that she is returned to China without having the chance for the merits of her claim to be decided according to law  The prospects of the proposed additional ground will therefore be highly influential in relation to the fate of the present application   Especially that is so in the present case as the explanation given by the Applicant in her supporting affidavit for why an application for leave was not filed in time was not  in itself  particularly compelling  In that affidavit she stated that  On    th of November hearing  I was not given any result of the hearing  I have not been served the court decision up till now  My natural justice has been denied  As the result I failed to lodge appeal application by the time limit     sic  The published reasons for judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court record that the Applicant was in attendance on   November   when her application was dismissed for reasons apparently given ex tempore   It is not clear though whether or not those reasons for judgment were simultaneously translated for the Applicant  Further  I do bear in mind the ignorance of the English language that she has consistently displayed before me in the course of proceedings to date   In deciding whether or not to reopen the judicial review proceeding it was pertinent for the Federal Magistrates Court to consider not only the explanation  if any  for the failure on the part of the Applicant to appear at the date  time and place appointed for the hearing of the judicial review application but also the merits of that application  The learned Magistrate approached the question of whether or not to reopen the proceeding in just this way  Absent the belated raising of an issue as to whether there had been a violation of the requirement in s  R  of the Migration Act that conduct engaged in by a visa applicant be disregarded in certain circumstances  an application of the principles which attend whether to grant leave would  in my opinion  lead to a conclusion that leave to appeal ought to be refused   As pleaded  the grounds upon which the judicial review of the Tribunal s decision was sought were doomed to fail  Had this not been the case and notwithstanding the considerable reservations the learned Magistrate so obviously had concerning the adequacy of the explanation given by the Applicant for her failure to attend court on   October   one might have expected that the proceeding in the Federal Magistrates Court would have been reopened  If the explanation for absence was unsatisfactory but the grounds of the application were nonetheless arguable  such delay and expense as had been occasioned by the failure of the Applicant to appear on   October   the justice of the case might have required an order for costs associated with the appearance that day being the Minister s costs in the proceeding in any event  or some other form of order for costs in favour of the Minister  but an order for reopening nonetheless  A failure so to deal with the application for reopening in such a way might very well have attracted a grant of leave   Subsection  R  of the Migration Act provides        For the purposes of the application of this Act and the regulations to a particular person             a  in determining whether the person has a well founded fear of being persecuted for one or more of the reasons mentioned in Article  A  of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol    disregard any conduct engaged in by the person in Australia unless     b  the person satisfies the Minister that the person engaged in the conduct otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening the person s claim to be a refugee within the meaning of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol
