Reid v South Australia   FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedThomas v State of South Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In   Mr Reid sought  unsuccessfully  to have that native title claim struck out for want of authorisation  see Thomas v State of South Australia   FCA     After filing the application on   May   Mr Reid purported to file two further amended applications  one on   June   the other on   July    I have had regard to these for the purposes of the State s motion and  formally  I have proceeded as if leave had been given to file and serve that of   June    The State s submissions proceeded on that basis  I took this course because I would in any event have had to strike out the original application because  according to the express terms used in Schedule of O of that application  Mr Reid was  as a member of another claim group   specifically excluded from this application s claim group    The Schedule A claim group is made up of a two page list of   named persons followed by the reference to  other living Kokatha persons as described in Attachment A   Mr Reid claims that access to this Attachment is  restricted   The Attachment provided greater detail about Mr Reid and the named persons and then continues         The Claim group also has the capacity to contain descendents of prior attendees and participants in KPC meetings and activities    if they are not already in the claim group  and if they are have the necessary ancestry relating to inheritance  i e  if they are valid Kokatha   Such live persons or live descendents will be included in the claim group in due course  at the discretion of KPC Elders and Advisors          The Claim Group also has the capacity to contain live descendents of prior Custodians over parts of the Kokatha Nation Territory  Such persons will be included in the claim group in due course  at the discretion of KPC Elders and Advisors         The Claim Group also has the capacity to contain adopted persons from other tribes  and their Kokatha descendents  using criteria such as whether such people acknowledge and are schooled in Kokatha law and custom  participate in Kokatha activities  or have valid interests in part of Kokatha Nation territory   The exact criteria that  sic  used will be up to the Elders to decide     Original emphasis citedHarrington Smith v State of Western Australia  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  As Lindgren J commented in Harrington Smith v State of Western Australia  No     FCA   at        The expression  native title claim group  is defined in s   to mean  relevantly  the native title claim group mentioned in this passage  The expression is commonly and understandably used to refer to the group on whose behalf a native title determination application claimant application is made  Indeed  Form   prescribed by para  a  of the Native Title  Federal Court  Regulations    Cth  uses the expression in that sense  treating  claimants  and members of the  native title claim group  as synonymous  But there is no escaping the fact that the  native title claim group  all of whose members are required by s   to authorise the applicant to apply  is a group constituted by all the actual holders  according to their traditional laws and customs  of the common or group rights or interests comprising the particular native title claimed   Section   provides that where a native title application is one authorised by a claim group the application must  a  name the persons constituting the group or  b  otherwise describe the persons sufficiently clearly so that it can be ascertained whether any particular person is one of those persons    Authorisation  for the purposes of s   is defined in s  B as follows     For the purposes of this Act  all the persons in a native title claim group     authorise a person or persons to make a native title determination application     and to deal with matters arising in relation to it  if         a  where there is a process of decision making that  under the traditional laws and customs of the persons in the native title claim group     must be complied with in relation to authorising things of that kind the persons in the native title claim group     authorise the person or persons to make the application and to deal with the matters in accordance with that process  or      b  where there is no such process the persons in the native title claim group     authorise the other person or persons to make the application and to deal with the matters in accordance with a process of decision making agreed to and adopted  by the persons in the native title claim group     in relation to authorising the making of the application and dealing with the matters  or in relation to doing things of that kind    Original emphasis  I have noted above the tie between group membership and authorisation  Of the significance of authorisation I need do more than gratefully adopt what was said by Lindgren J in Harrington Smith  No   at        Proper authorisation is the foundation for the institution and maintenance of a native title claimant application under s   of the new Act  Perry and Lloyd   Australian Native Title Law  Thomson Lawbook Co    at     p    Authorisation is

   at   ff  It is in that group s favour that a determination  if successful  is made  ibid  see also Colbung v State of Western Australia   FCA     I would add that it is unsurprising that the definition of the group itself suffers the above vices  Mr Reid s claim seeks to replace the Kokatha Native Title claim  The claim group itself reflects a house divided  The consequences of this becomes the more apparent when one turns to the authorisation requirement  cf the comments of Mansfield J in Landers at     I consider that the application does not comply with the requirements of s   of the Act   The evidence on authorisation has been set out above  While the Form   suggests three distinct bases of authorisation  i  self authorisation   ii  authorisation by Elders of surrounding Western Desert Tribes and  iii  authorisation by KPC members at a meeting on   March   the application itself does not betray whether these are intended to be alternative or cumulative  What is said in the Form   is not replicated precisely in the accompanying affidavit  No reference is made to self authorisation  I note in passing that  i  there is no evidence provided by Mr Reid that the enumerated claim group acknowledge his power of self authorisation  and  ii  Mr Reid has attempted to secure the signatures of some  but by no means all  of the listed claim group both to a copy of the list and to an attached claim map both unnecessary steps if Mr Reid could self authorise  Equally in Attachment R  reference is made to Elders at the Spear Creek meeting and to the fact that some of those  have now authorized Mr Reid to attend to Kokatha Native Title matters   It is not at all clear whether these Elders were Western Desert Elders  as para   of Part A  of Form   might suggest  or were Kokatha Elders  as the Attachment R comments on the KPC meeting would suggest  citedColbung v State of Western Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  It is

second is that where the class membership is described  not listed  there must be descriptive certainty of the class  i e  the application must describe the persons who are within the class

  FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Finally I should note that s  C  provides that  if an application does not comply with s   s  A or s   a party to the proceedings may at any time apply to this Court to strike it out  All I need observe here is that the court s power should be exercised only where the claim as expressed is untenable upon the  version of the evidence  favourable to the respondent to the strike out  McKenzie   at   Bodney v Bropho   FCAFC         FCR     It is submitted by the State that the described native title claim group is flawed in two respects   i  it is descriptively uncertain in that  beyond the listed members  the group may be expanded to include persons of certain characteristics at the discretion of certain people  see para     of Attachment A quoted earlier  and  ii  the present group is only part of the group acknowledged by Mr Reid to be capable of being brought within it as witness the exclusion of persons previously acknowledged by him and by Kokatha lawmen to be representatives of the Kokatha people  the suggestion that Mr Reid is able to add thousands to the claim group and the assertion that members of the claim group are members of the KPC  although as such they bring a claim  for Kokatha people  see the affidavit accompanying the application quoted above   It is unnecessary for me to express a concluded view on the former the descriptive uncertainty submission as I am satisfied that the claim group as described is merely part of a group  Nonetheless  I would comment that there is an arguable case of uncertainty in the description of the possible members who may be given entry to the group in the future  These are envisaged by clauses   to   of Attachment A  They may or may not be admitted to the group at the discretion of KPC elders  Leaving to one side the arresting character of the stated criteria of cl    prior attendance and participation in KPC meetings etc  there is nothing to suggest that the discretions given are a product of  and are to be informed by  the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the aboriginal peoples holding the native title rights and interests in question  The clauses may well be vulnerable at this point for this reason citedBriggs v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales   FCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Attachment A to the application indicates that the listed members of the claim group are KPC members  The KPC constitution ties membership to acceptance by Mr Reid  The KPC  though  is not a holder of native title rights and interests  Neither can it authorise a native title claim  cf Briggs v Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales   FCA         ALR    A native title group whose members are the members of an incorporated association may  where there is no relevant and mandatory traditional decision making process applicable to the making and conduct of a claimant application  agree to and adopt a process for those purposes  see s  B b  and Bolton v State of Western Australia   FCA   at     There is no reason in principle to prevent them agreeing to  and adopting a process which utilises a meeting of their association  But  as French J indicated in Bolton at   the s  B b  requirement necessitates that the authorisation process must be able to be traced to a decision of the native title group who adopt that process citedBolton v State of Western Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth

traced to a decision of the native title group who adopt that process   It is at this point of tracing back that the alleged authorisation s ineffectiveness becomes apparent  While there is evidence that the less than   of the   members of the claim group who were present at the meeting voted unanimously for the application to be made  there is no evidence at all that such notice of the meeting as was given  advertised other than that an AGM was to be held  There is nothing to suggest that the group members were being asked to agree to and adopt a non traditional process for authorising a claimant application  This would  of itself  be enough to reject the legitimacy of the claimed authorisation process  Further  and in light both of the evidence on notice and of the limited attendance  there is no reasonably arguable basis on which one could infer that the meeting was fairly representative of the claim group  see Bolton at    There is not  in my view  any arguable basis for contending that the meeting was in the circumstances adequate to satisfy the requirements of s  B b    For the above reasons I have ordered that the application be struck out under s  C of the Native Title Act    I will order that my order suspending the above order be vacated citedCretazzo v Lombardi     SASR   The Court s general discretion to award costs is conferred by s   of the Federal Court

McKenzie v State of South Australia   FCA   at   I referred to the case law on s  A  Here I need only repeat what I said there     The most authoritative statement of the matters which should inform the exercise of discretion in awarding costs in light of this section was given by Lee J in Ward v Western Australia   FCA         FCR   in comments later endorsed by the Full Court in De Rose v State of South Australia  No     FCAFC    His Honour noted first  that s  A  is intended to remove the expectation that costs will follow the event but that despite this  the Court retains its discretion as to costs unlimited by subrule   secondly the  unreasonable conduct  of the parties is not a jurisdictional fact which preconditions the exercise of the discretion and  conversely  s  A  will not control or limit the discretion in subrule   thirdly  whilst the exercise of the discretion when making a costs order should be judicial  the starting point is that each party will bear their own costs   I do not go so far as to say that  where a strike out motion is brought  a native title claimant is entitled as of course to have that motion determined without fear of an adverse costs order  cf McKenzie   FCA   where costs orders were made on an application to discontinue under the shadow of an apprehended strike out motion  Each case must depend on its own circumstances  In the present matter I attribute particular importance to Mr Reid s being an unrepresented person who received spasmodic legal and other assistance which clearly was unequal to the challenge presented by the strike out motion  the motion was brought within a very short period after the filing of the application and the matter was dealt with expeditiously because of its potential to impact on the overlap proceedings  Mr Reid did not capitulate in the face of the flaws indicated to him by the State  He clearly erred in so doing  On balance  though  I do not consider that he so unreasonably caused the State and the ALRM to incur costs in connection with the conduct of the proceeding  or otherwise so acted as to warrant an adverse costs order   Accordingly  I will make no order as to costs   I would add this  Both the State and the ALRM in their submissions sought a costs order  inter alia  for the purpose of providing a clear message to any further potential native title claimants that it is necessary to ensure that matters of form and procedure are strictly to be adhered to when lodging claimant applications  As I earlier indicated  I do not regard deterrence to be a permissible reason for a costs order  This said  the fact and circumstances of this successful strike out motion ought be of no little interest to persons who have made  or who are contemplating making  claimant applications in relation to claim areas that overlap that in the Kokatha overlap proceedings    I certify that the preceding sixty three   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for

  URL  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedLatoudis v Casey   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The one additional comment I should make is that it is not proper to use the power to award costs to punish either a successful or an unsuccessful party  cf Latoudis v Casey   HCA         CLR   at     or as a deterrent to other would be applicants  I refer to these matters as Mr Reid clearly has been an irritant to others involved in the Kokatha Overlap Proceedings  SAD   of   and his stances and actions have  probably  in some degree impacted adversely upon their expectations in the conduct of those proceedings   The parties have filed written submissions on this matter  I do not intend to outline them in any detail  I have had regard to them  There are  though  two matters arising out of the submissions made by Mr Reid s counsel to which I should refer lest he continue to labour under several obvious illusions  First  I did not strike out Mr Reid s claim because of an alleged misunderstanding arising out of responses he made to questions I asked him and to which I referred above at   to    Secondly  I did not strike out the application for the reason that I did not want it to get in the way of a scheduled case management conference   It is clear that the application itself was a product of Mr Reid s increasing dissatisfaction both with the conduct of the Kokatha Native Title claim and with the overlap proceedings  SAD   of   in relation to the Barngala applicants  Even though he had other avenues open to him to express his point of view after his unsuccessful attempt to strike out the Kokatha Native Title Claim  I am satisfied that his own application was brought in good faith and I am satisfied that as a litigant in person for all practical purposes  he acted reasonably in instituting the proceedings even though the application itself was misconceived when considered in light of the distinctive requirements of the Native Title Act   I am not prepared to assume in light of his previous involvements in proceedings relating to the Kokatha Native Title claim that he should be regarded as adequately versed in the mysteries of the Native Title Act and hence as bearing the risk of his misconceptions  Further  I am not satisfied that the timing of his application was informed by some improper motive and in particular that of disrupting the conduct of other proceedings to the extent of any overlap  see s   of the Act  I accept that health considerations and the paucity of advice and assistance go far to explain the timing of the application
