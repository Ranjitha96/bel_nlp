Citigroup Pty Ltd v Mason   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedBienstein v Bienstein   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Although  because of the construction that I have adopted of s   of the WR Act  it is not necessary for me finally to determine whether the judgment of the District Court pronounced on   October   is interlocutory  I strongly incline in favour of the view that it is interlocutory  In Re Luck   HCA         ALR   at       McHugh ACJ  Gummow and Heydon JJ said     the usual test for determining whether an order is final or interlocutory is whether the order  as made  finally determines the rights of the parties in a principal cause pending between them  That question is answered by determining whether the legal effect of the judgment is final or not  If the legal effect of the judgment is final  it is a final order  otherwise  it is an interlocutory order  The order of Gleeson CJ refusing to grant leave to issue process was an interlocutory order  It did not finally determine Ms Luck s rights against the various defendants  if she has any such rights    emphasis in original  A similar view of the distinction between a final order and an interlocutory order had been taken by McHugh  Kirby and Callinan JJ in Bienstein v Bienstein   HCA         ALR    In that case their Honours characterised an order of a judge of the High Court dismissing an application for the removal of a cause pending in the Family Court into the High Court as an interlocutory order consideredHall v Nominal Defendant   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Hall v Nominal Defendant   HCA         CLR   at   Taylor J  with whom Owen J agreed  said     an order made in the course of an action or suit which does not conclude the rights of the parties inter se  although it may  of course  conclude the fate of the particular application in which it is made  is interlocutory only   In the same case at   Windeyer J observed that  the distinction between final and interlocutory orders has in England caused much difficulty   At     his Honour said  In most cases the test that seems to be most satisfactory   is   to look at the consequences of the order itself and to ask does it finally determine the rights of the parties in a principal cause pending between them  It is never enough to ask simply does the order finally determine the actual application or matter out of which it arises  because  subject to the possibility of an appeal  every order does that  unless it be an order that is expressly declared to be subject to variation   The effect of such decisions as there are of this Court on the point seems to me to be that when an action has been commenced between parties then whether an order in that action is interlocutory depends on whether or not it results in a final determination of that action  I say of  that action  because it appears that the question depends more upon the action actually brought by a writ than upon the cause of action upon which the writ was founded   After citing certain authorities in support of the view which he adopted  Windeyer J at   said  These cases are all illustrative of the general proposition that a final order is one which finally disposes  subject only to appeal  of an action or an existing dispute between parties   The action initiated by the filing of the Statement of Claim was not disposed of by the making of an order requiring Citigroup to pay Mr Mason an amount by way of annual leave entitlements plus interest  The claim for a penalty to be imposed on Citigroup remained to be determined  For the same reason  the dispute between the parties  which involved both Mr Mason s annual leave entitlements and the issue of whether a penalty should be imposed on Citigroup  was not finally resolved in the making of that order   No authorities touching on the proper construction of s   of the WR Act have been identified  Neither party submitted that the subsection should not be construed literally  So construed it discloses a legislative intention  in the specific case of the appeals for which s   provides  to override the general prohibition contained in s  A  of the Federal Court Act on the bringing of appeals from interlocutory judgments without leave to appeal being granted   I conclude that s   is to be construed literally  As a consequence I conclude that it is not necessary to obtain leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment of a court of a State or Territory in a matter arising under the WR Act notwithstanding that it is necessary to obtain leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment of the Court in a comparable matter citedHi Fert Pty Ltd v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR   It may be that the drafter of the notice of appeal overlooked that a judgment as defined by the Federal Court Act and the WR Act is an operative judicial act so that there is no appeal from reasons for judgment alone   Hi Fert Pty Ltd v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc  No       FCR    Nor does an appeal lie from a verdict alone prior to judgment being given   Musgrove v McDonald   HCA         CLR   at    I conclude that the reference to  the orders made on   October   is to be understood as  or including  a reference to the operative order of the District Court made on that day
