cth FMCA  htmlThe applicant relies upon the decision of Lindsay FM in SZLQK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FMCA     SZLQK   delivered on   May    His Honour there determined that the scheme of the Act required that s   dealt only with the initial constitution of the Tribunal  that reconstitution of the Tribunal could not be effected by using s   of the Act  and that reconstitution of the Tribunal could occur only if s   or s  A was available in the particular circumstances  see at      His Honour thought that  otherwise  there would be no need for either of those provisions  see at      He specifically indicated that cl   of the Principal Member s Direction issued on   August   headed  Caseload and Constitution Policy   which is in the same terms as cl   of the current direction  indicated a misapprehension on the part of the Principal Member that a remittal for reconsideration had the effect of requiring the constitution of a wholly new review  see at    His Honour concluded that  in the circumstances of that case  s   was not available as a mechanism to reconstitute the Tribunal by the Principal Member  at   and that the only means by which that could be done would be under s  A  The Principal Member had not made the reconstitution pursuant to that section  Hence  there was error on the part of the Principal Member in appointing a different member to constitute the Tribunal  Nevertheless  his Honour concluded that the error on the part of the Principal Member was not a jurisdictional error going to the validity of the decision of the Tribunal  It was a procedural error  and so the challenge did not succeed  In NBMB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship     ALD     NBMB   delivered on   February   Flick J reached a different conclusion  As it happened  his Honour s conclusion was not part of the ultimate reason for deciding the case  In the course of a challenge to a decision of the Tribunal  the applicant sought leave to amend the application to allege that the reconstitution of the Tribunal on the remittal of the review had been improper  His Honour refused leave to so amend the application  and in any event his Honour said that he would have resolved the point adversely to that applicant  In that case  as here  the Minister said that the reconstitution of the Tribunal following the quashing of its earlier decision was made under s   of the Act rather than s  A of the Act  as contemplated by Lindsay FM in SZLQK    His Honour noted that the justice of the case  when a decision of the Tribunal has been set aside  is generally that the Tribunal be reconstituted by a different member  see also Northern NSW FM Pty Limited v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal     FCR   at   Australian Trade Commission v Underwood

power that can be exercised from time to time  Acts Interpretation Act    Cth  s    The discretion to exercise that power  his Honour said  is to be exercised in the light of all the circumstances  including the order of the Federal Magistrates Court quashing the initial decision and what is recognised as  justice being seen to be done   His Honour also adverted to the possibility that the unavailability of a member for the purposes of s   may not simply be where the term of appointment has expired  or the member has died or become unable to carry out his duties  or has resigned  Unavailability might also arise  his Honour speculated at   where an order is made quashing the decision of the Tribunal as originally constituted  Otherwise  a member may remain  available  even

confers a power of appointment upon the principal member or his delegate  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang   HCA         CLR   at   per McHugh J  In the present proceedings  that power was exercised by a person with an appropriate delegation  The applicant submitted that s   of the Acts Interpretation Act    Cth  does not support the conclusion I have reached  although Flick J in NBMB in the passage set out above also referred to it  It relevantly provides that  where an Act confers a power  then that power may be exercised from time to time as the occasion arises  unless the contrary intention appears  The argument was that  by reason of ss   and  A  a contrary intention did appear  I have rejected the contention that ss   and  A cover all the circumstances in which the Tribunal may be reconstituted  as I consider they confine the general power in s   only in respect of the circumstances to which they relate  In other circumstances  or at least in circumstances such as the present  they do not limit the availability of s   to permit the reconstitution of the Tribunal  They do not reveal the contrary intention asserted on behalf of the applicant  Section   of the Acts Interpretation Act    Cth  therefore can  as it does  make clear that the power under s   may where it is available to be used be exercised from time to time  In the light of that conclusion  I do not need to consider the alternative contention of the Minister that  in any event  s   applies as the circumstances enable the Tribunal to be reconstituted because the initial member is not  or is no longer  available  for the purpose of the review  That was a possibility adverted to by Flick J in NBMB at    There are some circumstances where  in the interests of justice  the remitted review might clearly be conducted by the initially appointed member  an obvious example is where the member applied the law as expressed in a binding decision  but that decision was subsequently reversed on an appeal   Thus  it would not appear that the quashing of a decision of the initial member necessarily leads to that member then becoming no longer  available  to conduct the review  Consequently  if that alternative contention is correct  the concept of availability would be a somewhat amorphous one  perhaps depending on the nature and gravity of the jurisdictional error in the first decision  It is not clear that such an inquiry was intended when a decision of the Tribunal has been quashed for jurisdictional error  I note the applicant s further argument in support of the alternative contention  based on s  b  referring to the initial member of the Tribunal no longer being available for the purpose of the review  at the place  where the review is being conducted  It was argued that such an expression  directing attention to a geographical focus as one of the elements for the exercise of the power  also indicates that s   is not available in circumstances such as the present to reconstitute the Tribunal  It is not necessary to address that argument  in view of my conclusion above  I note that the  place where the review is being conducted  is not defined in the Act  Section  A refers to the place at which a decision is to be handed down  A review may be conducted by a member sitting in one location or State  and the visa applicant being in another location or State  sometimes a legal representative or another migration agent  or an interpreter  is in yet another location  Sometimes  I assume  the hearing conducted under s   will occur away from the location or State in which the application for review was filed  I suspect that the reference to the  place where the review is being conducted  is not a necessary limiting factor upon when a member is no longer  available  to conduct that review  As I have said  it is not necessary to decide that question citedNorthern NSW FM Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal     FCR  In NBMB v

decision of the Full Court in SZEPZ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC         FCR    I have given anxious thought to whether that decision  which is of course binding on me  dictates a different conclusion to the one I have reached  Where the Tribunal has been differently reconstituted following the quashing of its initial decision  that case decided that s  A did not require the Tribunal as newly constituted to re give particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason  or part of the reason  for affirming the decision under review  I do not think that decision dictates an opposite conclusion  Clearly  in the case of a Tribunal reconstituted under ss   or  A  where the Tribunal s task is to  finish the review  that decision is apt  It may also be apt where the Tribunal has been reconstituted under s   where at least in one sense the process of review by its consideration of a member of the Tribunal recommences  In the latter circumstance  the activating fact to enliven s  A must be the assessment of the information by the Tribunal as constituted  If  however  as appears to have been the case in that decision  the Tribunal as reconstituted formed the same view about certain information as the Tribunal as previously constituted  because  as the Full Court pointed out at   the giving of the required notice may be given administratively  the notice given earlier would satisfy s  A  The second ground of review  so the applicant argues  is that the Tribunal wrongly asked whether the applicant is a conscientious objector rather than whether he would refuse to undergo further military service if he were to return to Israel  For that reason  I have put the words  conscientious objector  in quotation marks in the heading to this part of my reasons  The critical part of its reasons are set out at   above citedDranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   HCA         ALJR  http www

Thompson   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlI do not need to consider the contention that the Tribunal  by focusing on the term  conscientious objector  as it is explained in the context of s  A of the National Service Act    Cth  in R v District Court of Queensland Northern District  Ex parte Thompson   HCA         CLR   at   failed to ask itself the correct

can be shortly dealt with discussedSZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlSection   obliges the Tribunal to invite the applicant to appear to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review  The nature and extent of that obligation  in the sense of the Tribunal putting the applicant on notice as to the matters he should address at the hearing  was discussed by the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA   at       and    In particular  at   the Court  Gleeson CJ  Kirby  Hayne  Callinan and Heydon JJ  said    Ordinarily then  as was the case here  the Tribunal will begin its interview of an applicant who has accepted the Tribunal s invitation to appear  knowing that it is not persuaded by the material already before it to decide the review in the applicant s favour  That lack of persuasion may be based on particular questions the Tribunal has about specific aspects of the material already before it  it may be based on nothing more particular than a general unease about the veracity of what is revealed in that material  But unless the Tribunal tells the applicant something different  the applicant would be entitled to assume that the reasons given by the delegate for refusing to grant the application will identify the issues that arise in relation to that decision  It is appropriate  where there has been a remittal of an earlier decision of the Tribunal  to apply that observation to the reasons given by the Tribunal as earlier constituted  provided of course that the reasons for that decision being quashed do not negate the relevant earlier reasons  The problem here  however  is not that the Tribunal did not ask the applicant to expand on those aspects of his claim based upon his asserted political beliefs which would lead him not to undertake further military service and to explain why that account should be accepted  The problem here  as I have found  is simply that the Tribunal appears not to have recognised that the applicant did expand on that aspect of his claim as it did not then consider whether to accept his evidence or to consider its consequences  In my view  the Tribunal s error was not in failing to fulfil the requirements of s    It is a different one  For those reasons  I direct that the decision of the Tribunal given on   July   be quashed  and the matter constituting the review instigated by application made on   May   be remitted to the Tribunal again for consideration according to law  The Minister should pay to the applicant his costs of the application   I certify that the preceding sixty two   numbered
