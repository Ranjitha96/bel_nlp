VWDC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldistinguishedApplicant M  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Finally  I wish to say a brief word about an authority cited by the appellant during the hearing  Appearing on her own behalf  the appellant referred to one case in support of her argument  The case  Applicant M  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC     is one where the Full Court allowed an appeal on multiple grounds  including failure of the tribunal to comply with the requirements of s  A  Unfortunately for the appellant  the case does not significantly advance her claims in the matter before me now   In M    the tribunal had noted and relied on inconsistencies between direct oral testimony of the applicant and conflicting testimony by the applicant s husband  Though the husband s testimony was given at the hearing and in the presence of the applicant  the Full Court found that  under a strict reading of s  A   the applicant was to be given notice  in writing  of the tribunal s intended reliance on discrepancies between the husband s testimony and the applicant s testimony  Applicant M  v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at          In the instant case  the hearing testimony relied upon by the tribunal came directly from the appellant  herself  and was therefore exempted under s  A b  as information that  the applicant gave   There was no third party testimony cited or relied upon by the tribunal in reaching its decision   The appeal will be dismissed with costs    I certify that the preceding sixteen   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finkelstein   Associate Dated    June   First appellant in person        Counsel for the First Respondent  Ms S Burchell     Solicitor for the First Respondent  Australian Government Solicitor     Date of Hearing    May       Date of Judgment    June           AustLII  Copyright Policy

www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In fact it is not the appellant but the first respondent who has raised the possibility that the tribunal decision may have been based on information not provided to the appellant under s  A  The first respondent s counsel referred to decisions in the High Court to the effect that the tribunal must strictly comply with s  A  see SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR    Thus  any finding that information was not properly provided would be a jurisdictional error and the tribunal s decision would necessarily be vacated by this Court   The first instance involves the dates on which the Sri Lanka Provincial Council elections occurred  The tribunal states in its Findings and Reasons       t he applicant had submitted in her protection visa application lodged in July   that she had been recently involved in the Provincial Council election campaigns but stated at the hearing that she assisted with the   Provincial Council elections  There were  however  no such elections in   rather these occurred in   in the months before her departure for Australia      The tribunal then went on to explain that this inconsistency was one consideration that led the tribunal to doubt the truth of the appellant s story   Since I have determined that the  information  in question all qualifies under the statutory exemption in s  A    it is not necessary to examine the specifics of whether and how the information was relayed to the appellant  I do note  however  that the High Court s ruling in SAAP makes it clear that any information required under s  A must be given to an applicant in writing   see SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA         ALR   at   per McHugh J  at   per Gummow J  at   per Hayne J  This would be necessary even in a situation where the tribunal discusses adverse information with an applicant during the hearing and gives the applicant an opportunity to comment  Thus  were any of the information at issue in this case not subject to exemption under s  A    the appellant might very well have succeeded in her appeal citedSZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  At first blush  it might appear that the tribunal was comparing written information from the appellant s visa application with the appellant s testimony at the hearing  In its reasons  however  the tribunal explained that the appellant s visa application was merely the medium that raised the issue for the tribunal  see eg SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at       per Moore J  at   per Allsop J  The inconsistency itself arose between the appellant s testimony that she participated in   Provincial Council elections  and the independent country information stating that the scheduled   elections never occurred and were  instead  postponed until nearly   see ibid  Thus  the information which is relevant for the purposes of s  A is the independent country information and the appellant s hearing testimony   Section  A b  provides that information given by an applicant for the purpose of the application is exempted from the disclosure requirements of s  A  While some cases might call into question when  specifically  information is given  for the purpose of the application  I think it is beyond question that testimony given by an applicant in a statutory hearing pursuant to s   of the Migration Act is given in support of  and therefore  for the purpose of  the application followedVAAC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Similarly  with regard to independent country information  s  A a  exempts such general information from the requirements of s  A when it is not specifically about the applicant or another person  This is established by numerous Full Court authorities  see VJAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC     VHAP of   v
