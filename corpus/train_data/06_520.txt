A   D Douglas Pty Ltd ACN       v Lawyers Private Mortgages Pty Ltd ACN        with Corrigendum dated   May     FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedHungerfords v Walker   HCA           CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html   The applicants seek compound interest  They submit that the decision of the High Court in Hungerfords v Walker   HCA           CLR   is authority for the proposition that compound interest may be awarded by way of damages  The decision is certainly authority for that proposition  Such an award is distinct from an award of interest pursuant to the statutory power conferred upon this Court by s  A of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   the  Federal Court Act   It is clear from the reasons of Mason CJ and Wilson J at    Brennan and Deane JJ concurring  that an award of compound interest must be for  a foreseeable loss  necessarily within the contemplation of the parties  which is directly related to the defendant s breach of contract or tort    In that case  the plaintiff conducted a business and had borrowed substantial amounts for that purpose  The award was designed to compensate the plaintiff for specifically identifiable losses  Compound interest was not allowed by way of damages on amounts which would have been spent for private purposes    As far as I am aware  none of the applicants has asserted a case of the kind considered in Hungerfords   Given the relatively small amounts of most investments and the personal circumstances of many of the applicants  it is likely that many would have expended any interest on living expenses and other private outgoings  The loss of interest may have caused them a degree of hardship or discomfort  but they cannot be compensated for that in dollar terms  It is not appropriate  in this case  to award compound interest as damages    As to the rate at which the awards should bear interest pursuant to s  A  ex   contains information as to bank deposit rates for the period from July   until September    The table shows monthly fluctuations in interest rates for various types of deposit and for various periods  Given that the applicants have been out of their funds since   July   it seems appropriate to adopt the rate payable for the longest available term which is five years  The average rate over the period from   July   until September   is     per cent  The awards will bear interest at that rate from   July   until the date of judgment  To this sum will be added  in the case of each applicant  interest at the same rate on the amount of the first distribution for the period of     years and on the amount of the second distribution for     years  There may have to be further adjustments in the cases of the thirty eighth and thirty ninth applicants  I will hear further submissions after publication of these reasons    It might be thought that this approach involves the award of interest upon interest  which approach is not permitted by s  A  I refer to my inclusion of an amount for interest in calculating the award of damages and then allowing interest on the amount of the award  However I do not understand s  A to regulate the calculation of damages  It rather addresses the award of interest after such calculation  It does not authorize compound interest on an award distinguishedGilmour v AMP General Insurance     ANZIC      MDRN seeks to narrow the construction of cl  e v  of the St Paul policy  submitting that it does not operate to deprive an innocent partner of indemnity where loss is the result of the dishonest or fraudulent act of an employee  The point is clearly unarguable  Clause  e v  specifically excludes indemnity where the loss occurs in those circumstances  The argument would result in the clause having no effect whatsoever  MDRN sought to rely upon the decision of the Full Court of South Australia in Gilmour v AMP General Insurance     ANZIC      However it is relatively clear that the case did not involve a clause such as cl  e v   There is nothing in this argument    As I understand it  my findings lead to the conclusion that St Paul is obliged to indemnify MDRN only in the amount of Mr Bengston s claim  However I will invite the parties to make further submissions should they wish to do so    One other matter requires comment  St Paul submits that the fees charged by Mr Jessup are not recoverable by the applicants  The applicants do not claim them as damages  However they were deducted from moneys received by Mr Jessup and so the amount thereof was not passed on to investors  The amount of each claim has been increased as a result of such deduction citedMoloney   Anor v Bells Securities Pty Ltd   Ors   QSC  http www austlii edu au au cases qld QSC  html   The reference to  Bells case  is to the decision of Chesterman J in Moloney   Anor v Bells Securities Pty Ltd   Ors   QSC    In that case his Honour declined to allow as damages the costs of a liquidator appointed in circumstances similar to those in the present case  St Paul s argument seems to be that as the period of the ASIC exemption was to expire on   October   a liquidator would have been appointed in any event  It is said to follow that the costs incurred by Mr Jessup were not a consequence  or perhaps a foreseeable consequence  of any conduct on the part of the respondents  particularly MDRN  The applicants did not take this point in argument  but it addresses the measure of damages in their claims against MDRN    In causes of action for misleading and deceptive conduct and negligent misstatement  the relevant measure of damages is designed to put the applicant in the position in which he or she would have been  had the relevant conduct not occurred  That is often achieved by awarding the difference between the value of the property acquired as a result of the relevant conduct and the price paid for it  However there are limits upon the extent of permissible recovery  I accept that for present purposes  the test of reasonable foreseeability provides such limit  Had Project Results discharged its obligation  the loan would have been repaid in    At the time of the relevant conduct it was reasonably foreseeable that the applicants would suffer loss as a result of Project Results failing to meet such obligations  It was also reasonably foreseeable that in that event  the applicants would have to resort to available securities  including Mr Rivett s guarantee  in order to recover their investments and interest  It was similarly foreseeable that  as a result of their conduct  MDRN and the trustee company would be unable to attend to such realization  and that somebody else would have to do so  That was likely to cost money citedOverseas Tankship  UK  Ltd v Morts Dock   Engineering Co Ltd  The Wagon Mound    AC    Paragraph   of the statement of claim pleads that     The  investment summary  represented and contained advice that the application from Rivett for an advance on specified security referred to in the  investment summary  had been approved by the Respondents under its loan application assessment programme  that being in accordance with the procedure referred to in paragraph      Paragraph   pleads representations in the brochure and newsletters concerning steps taken in assessing loan applications  Thus it is claimed on behalf of those applicants who received the brochure and or either or both of the newsletters that they understood the investment summary as referring to one or more of those other documents  See par   of the applicants  written submissions  As I understood the applicants  final submissions only those applicants who received the autumn   newsletter now rely on this alleged misrepresentation in the investment summary  It will be convenient to deal with this aspect after I have dealt with the other  more commonly shared  complaints    On pp   and   of the investment summary there are statements which suggest that all units  ex  A  or all units in Stage    ex  B  have been sold  I have previously set out relevant passages from pp       and   and given my reasons for concluding that a reader would take the statements in ex  A as referring to pre sale of all units in Stage    See      The difference in wording between ex  A and ex  B is of no consequence in this regard citedMount Isa Mines Ltd v Pusey   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlcitedSouth Australia v Johnson     ALR    In my view it was reasonably foreseeable that as a result of the conduct of the trustee company and MDRN  additional costs would be incurred in realizing the securities  That is sufficient to permit recovery by the applicants from MDRN of the reasonable costs so incurred  See South Australia v Johnson     ALR    The prospective expiry of the ASIC exemption played no causal role in the incurrence by the applicants of their costs  nor did it render them too remote to be recoverable in these proceedings    MDRN pleads professional indemnity policies with QBE for the periods from   September   to   September    the   policy    September   to   September    the   policy  and   September   to   September    the   policy   Clause     of each policy provided     QBE agrees to indemnify the insured against legal liability for any Claim for compensation first made against the Insured during the Period of Cover and which is notified to QBE during the Period of Cover  in respect of any civil liability whatsoever and howsoever incurred in the conduct of the Professional Business Practice    Pursuant to cl     the period for notification of a claim was extended to include the period of   days after the end of the period of cover  Clause     provided     If during the Period of Cover the Insured becomes aware of any fact or circumstance that might give rise to a Claim under this Policy and elects to give notice in writing to QBE of such fact or circumstance  then any Claim which may subsequently arise out of such fact or circumstance shall be deemed to be a Claim made during the Period of Cover PROVIDED ALWAYS THAT such written notice is given to QBE during the same period of cover or within   days after its expiry  discussedFAI General Insurance Co Limited v Australian Hospital Care Pty Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html   The decision of the High Court in FAI General Insurance Co Limited v Australian Hospital Care Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   at      per McHugh  Gummow and Hayne JJ  demonstrates that QBE is not entitled to avoid payment pursuant to the policy upon the basis of MDRN s failure to notify this claim during the period of cover  save to the extent permitted by s    Although MDRN s pleading does not say so  the relevant  act  for the purposes of s   is that failure  It may be that the decision in FAI v Australian Hospital Care can be distinguished for present purposes  I say that in view of the language of  election  contained in cl     of the present policy  The language of the policy in that case seems not to have contained that concept  It may be arguable that the High Court was not addressing a situation in which the parties had stipulated for an election  and that an election may not accurately be described as an  omission   However the contrary is also arguable  In any event  I proceed upon the basis that the decision is relevant to MDRN s claim to indemnity under the   policy    The cross claim was amended to add the claim under the   policy and reliance on s    The amendment was provoked by QBE s plea of non disclosure and misrepresentation in connection with the   policy  Paragraph   of the cross claim asserts     If the matters alleged by QBE in its amended defence do constitute non disclosure or misrepresentation in respect of the   policy  then those matters  or certain of them  would constitute a fact or circumstance that might give rise to a claim for the purpose of cl     of the previous year policy    This method of pleading is unsatisfactory  The matters so alleged by QBE are numerous  They relate to MDRN s system for loan approval and particular aspects of its conduct concerning the Yandina project  in particular  compilation of the investment summary  It would have been helpful had MDRN specified the precise matters which it claims to have omitted to notify  In any event  QBE denies that such matters could have given rise to a claim under the   policy  It also denies that during the term of that policy  MDRN became aware of such matters  It is said to follow that MDRN  are not  and were not during the term of the   policy  entitled to give notice  of such matters  and that cl     of the   policy therefore does not apply so as to deem there to be a claim under that policy  regardless of any question of late notification  As it is MDRN s primary position that it is entitled to indemnity pursuant to the   policy  it will be best to leave consideration of the argument concerning the   policy and the application of s   until the issue of liability under the   policy has been determined consideredPermanent Trustee Australia   Anor v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd     NSWLR    The question  then  is whether any of the three matters mentioned above was known to MDRN  and if so  whether it knew that any such matter was relevant to QBE s decision to accept the proposal  or whether a reasonable person  in the circumstances  could have been expected to know that such matter was relevant  It is appropriate to consider the meaning of each of the words  known   knows  and  know  in s    Two questions arise for consideration  The first is whether the required knowledge must be actual  or whether it is sufficient that it can be inferred from other matters known to the insured  The second is the extent to which the knowledge of some person other than the insured is to be imputed to him or her  The Insurance Contracts Act seems not to deal with either question other than in the bald terms of s    However the cases establish  with respect to the first question  that it is actual knowledge which must be disclosed  Thus in Permanent Trustee Australia   Anor v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd     NSWLR   at   Hodgson CJ in Equity  as his Honour then was  said     In my opinion   known  in s   means more than  suspected  or  believed   What is required is that the matter should be the subject of a true belief  held with sufficient assurance to justify the term  known   However  it must be remembered that a belief may sometimes itself be a matter relevant to the decision of an insurer  An insured may know that it has a particular belief  and know that its having that belief is relevant to the decision of an insurer  in which case that belief itself is a matter which must be disclosed  consideredPermanent Trustee Australia Co Ltd   Anor v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd   NSWCA         NSWLR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html   On appeal  at   NSWCA         NSWLR   Handley JA said at   et seq  Meagher and Powell JJA concurring         The problem of defining  for legal purposes  the boundary between belief and knowledge did not arise for the first time in this case  The problem has been considered in a number of legal contexts  and in general it may be said that  for legal purposes  our knowledge includes the facts  apart from matters of religious faith  that we believe to be true         Thus out of court admissions are receivable in evidence against a party if they disclose an intention to affirm or acknowledge the existence of a fact whatever the party s source of information or belief  see Lustre Hosiery Ltd v York   HCA         CLR   at    However  as the Court said  at              If it appears that  the party  had no knowledge  or that  although he had some means of knowledge  he had formed no certain or considered belief and indicated nothing amounting to a personal judgment or conclusion of his own  the probative force of the admission may be so small that a jury ought not to be allowed to act upon it alone  or in preference to opposing evidence                                When a person  on the basis of some information  holds a belief on which that person is prepared to act in the world of practical affairs  he or she knows that fact for most legal purposes  and certainly for the purposes of s     consideredMidaz Pty Ltd v Peter McCarthy Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd     Qd R    In Midaz Pty Ltd v Peter McCarthy Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd     Qd R   the Court of Appeal of Queensland addressed the question of whether a person who was aware of certain facts should be taken to have knowledge of a reasonably available inference from those facts  Of that proposition Pincus JA said at      Moynihan SPJ and Byrne J concurring     Acceptance of that argument must depend on adoption of a construction of section   which is rather generous to insurers  that the section means that if an insured knows matter A which is not in itself relevant to insurance  but the insured should reasonably infer from matter A a further matter B which is so relevant  then the duty to disclose matters A and B arises  This construction is in practical terms little different from reading the introductory part of section   as if it included the expression      every matter that is known to or should be inferred by the insured       I have found no authority which supports such a reading  nor does it appear to be one which must be adopted to give section   a sensible operation  consideredAdvance  NSW  Insurance Agencies Pty Ltd v Matthews     ANZ Ins Cas      As to imputed knowledge  in Advance  NSW  Insurance Agencies Pty Ltd v Matthews     ANZ Ins Cas     Young J said at      Although the language of section   is awkward  in my view it means that if a reasonable person in the circumstances could be expected to know that a matter is relevant it must be disclosed and whether that be the case or not  if the insured actually knows the relevant thing  that is enough  However  the insured must have actual knowledge of the thing  the mere fact that he ought in the ordinary course of business to have known is insufficient    Nonetheless  in some cases  knowledge of an agent will be imputed to the principal  In Peter MacDonald Eggers  Simon Picken and Patrick Foss  Good Faith and Insurance Contracts   nd ed  Insurance Law Library  London    the authors assert at par        The agents whose knowledge principally is imputed to the assured are those agents who are concerned with the custody  care or status of the subject matter insured  general agents who are so placed with respect to the assured that they may be said to make decisions for the assured generally and agents who are charged with arranging the insurance  citedLindsay v CIC Insurance Ltd     NSWLR    The authors of MacGillivray on Insurance Law   th ed  say at par      It is not all agents whose knowledge is imputed in that way for purposes of non disclosure but only those agents who are  agents to know  that is to say  are responsible for keeping the assured informed about the subject matter of the insurance  either because they are responsible for placing the insurance or because they have the management of it for the assured  If such an agent owes a duty to communicate information which is relevant to the insurance  but fails to do so  the assured is deemed to know what in the ordinary routine of his business he should have been told if the agent had performed his duty  but he will not be deemed to know facts which  whether or not owing to the deficient organization of the business  no agent was responsible for communicating to him      See also Lindsay v CIC Insurance Ltd     NSWLR   and Ayoub v Lombard Insurance Co  Aust  Pty Ltd     ANZ Ins Cas     citedAyoub v Lombard

Imp  applied to non marine insurance  After reference to the authorities  his Lordship observed at      These judgments make it clear to my mind that it is not the knowledge of all agents or servants that is imputed to the proposer of any marine insurance  but only the knowledge of quite a limited class  namely  the broker who actually places the insurance  the master or the ship agent  or  to use Lord Halsbury s phrase   his general agent for the management of his shipping business   On the facts of the present case  Henderson was not within that limited class  Though  in a sense  the key man in the sense that a mistake by him would mean the failure of the system his duties were almost entirely clerical  it was not established that he had any discretion or executive authority  he was not superior to the head clerks in the warehouses but co ordinate with them  He was not  in my judgment  a person within the class of those who were under a duty to report to the company      See also Sutton s Insurance Law in Australia   rd ed  at pars     and     and Tarr s Australian Insurance Law at      It seems to be generally accepted that the position under the Insurance Contracts Act reflects the common law position    The general principles to which I have referred are subject to a critical qualification  In ANZ Bank v Colonial Wharves  supra  McNair J said at      There is  however  another answer in law to the third party s contention on this point  namely  that assuming that he was within the class of persons who were under a duty to report so that his knowledge was to be imputed to his principal  he  on the principle stated in Bell   Anor v Lever Bros Ltd   Ors   UKHL       A C    and J C Houghton   Co v Nothard  Lowe   Wills Ltd   A C        was under no duty to report his own dereliction of duty  and his knowledge of that dereliction is not to be imputed to his principals   Lord Atkin   A C    at p   puts the matter succinctly in the following passage         The servant owes a duty not to steal  but  having stolen  is there super added a duty to confess that he has stolen  I am satisfied that to imply such a duty would be a departure from the well established usage of mankind and would be to create obligations entirely outside the contemplation of the parties concerned         Sutton observes  concerning that decision  at      What had to be considered was what an honest and competent agent would have communicated to the assured in the ordinary course of business  and such an agent would not have had any dishonesty to reveal  consideredAustralian Insurance Law Commercial Union Assurance Co of Australia Ltd v Beard     ANZ Ins Cas      McNair J discussed the matter at length in Australia and New Zealand Bank Limited v

rd ed  at pars     and     and Tarr s Australian Insurance Law at      It seems to be generally accepted that the position under the Insurance Contracts Act reflects the common law position    As the duty to disclose extends only to matters which the insured knows  only matters actually known to a relevant agent will be imputed to him or her  In Commercial Union Assurance Co of Australia Ltd v Beard     ANZ Ins Cas     Davies AJA  Meagher JA and Foster AJA concurring  said at        The terms  known  and  knows  are used in their common law sense  Their primary denotation refers to that which is actually known  but it would be wrong to import the word  actually  into a provision such as section    The section does not use it  The terms  known  and  knows  are used in their ordinary sense  Whether a matter is known is a question of fact for the judge or jury  consideredHammer Waste Pty Ltd v QBE Mutual Ltd   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html   In Hammer Waste Pty Ltd v QBE Mutual Ltd   NSWSC     Palmer J referred to that decision and said          I n s       the word  know  is used in its ordinary sense  it implies actual  not constructive  knowledge both on the part of the insured and on the part of any agent or employee of the insured whose  knowledge  is to be imputed to the insured  The obligation to disclose something  known  can attach only to something which  at the time for disclosure  a person actually has in his or her consciousness or else something which exists in some record or other source of information which the person actually knows about and to which the person has access  So  for example  I  know  my driving licence number for the purposes of s       even though I cannot recite it off hand because I actually know that it is to be found in the plastic card in my wallet    I return to the three matters which may have required disclosure  I am satisfied that a reasonable person  in the circumstances  could be expected to know that each of those matters would be relevant to QBE s decision  I have indicated with respect to the third of those matters  divergence between contents of the newsletters and actual practice  that I am not satisfied that there was any significant divergence  However  for reasons which appear below  it is not necessary finally to decide that question    QBE asserts that Mr Ryan was familiar with the content of the investment summary and knew that Mr Blackadder did not carry out detailed checks of the asset positions of applicants for loans as allegedly asserted in the newsletters  or credit checks against guarantors as asserted in the winter   newsletter  It is said to follow that he had knowledge which should have been disclosed  In my view unless asked  Mr Ryan had no duty to disclose either the content of the newsletters or the actual practice which was adopted  At least for present purposes  neither matter  by itself  exposed either MDRN or QBE to risk  The relevant matter was the alleged divergence between the two  As I have said  I do not necessarily accept that there was a significant divergence  It is at least arguable that the practice as described by Mr Blackadder and Mr Ryan was a form of checking in the sense in which the term was used in the newsletters  Potential investors may have understood the newsletters to imply something more  but for present purposes we are looking at the subjective states of mind of Mr Blackadder and Mr Ryan
