Australia Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlOf the offences charged the most serious are those relating to the baby walkers  The two charges are linked  The prosecutor s investigation of the conduct of the defendant in marketing the baby walkers was commenced following a complaint from a member of the public who had purchased a walker from the defendant through the internet  The prosecutor then arranged for similar walkers to be purchased from the defendant and caused them to be subjected to analysis  As already noted  this analysis revealed that the walkers did not comply with standards prescribed pursuant to s  C of the Act   Proceeding VID   of   relates to the  controlled  supply of the walkers to an officer employed by the prosecutor  Proceeding VID   of   relates to the supply of the walker to the member of the public who complained to the prosecutor  Any supply of the walkers would constitute a breach of s  AZS  of the Act   Forty seven such sales were admitted  Charges have only been laid in respect to the sales to the prosecutor and the complainant  Of the two sales the one to the complainant is the one in respect of which the defendant bears the greater degree of culpability  It was to be used by her daughter and would have been had the complainant not been alert to the deficiencies in the product and the absence of labelling  The walkers purchased by the investigator were not destined for use by any child  In considering the quantum of the penalties for these two offices  and  indeed  all the penalties to be imposed  I am required also to give effect to the totality principle in order to avoid a crushing aggregate penalty and to ensure  so far as is possible  that the aggregate penalty reflects the totality of the criminality involved  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chubb Security Australia Pty Ltd   FCA   at      Having regard to all the circumstances I consider that the appropriate penalty in proceeding VID   should be   and in proceeding VID      The offence relating to the statement that the cots complied with Australian standards when they did not is also serious  No fewer than   departures from the prescribed standard were identified  I consider that a penalty of   is warranted in proceeding VID    The final offence concerned the notice which advised customers that refunds were not available for products sold by defendant during a stock clearance  In my view an appropriate penalty in proceeding VID   is      I certify that the preceding twenty six
