Australian Competition   Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAmadio Pty Ltd v Henderson     FCR   Another instance of an appropriate case is where one party has unreasonably refused an offer to compromise  The principle is derived from Calderbank v Calderbank     All ER    A party may set up a situation in which an award of indemnity costs is possible by making a reasonable offer of compromise in what is described as a  Calderbank letter  containing the terms of the offer and signifying that the letter will be relied upon to found an application for costs on an indemnity basis in the event that it turns out that the offer ought to have been accepted  To some extent  O   of the Federal Court Rules now codifies the circumstances in which refusal of an offer of compromise will found an application for indemnity costs  The area of law has become beset by technicality  much of which appears to me to be unnecessary  Arguments were raised in the present case about whether letters written by one party or another did or did not fit within what the authorities would regard as a Calderbank letter  In particular  it was said that there must be a true offer to compromise  involving the giving of something  and not merely a demand that the other party capitulate  I am by no means certain that this is a universal rule  Whatever the terms of any letter  or other means of conveying an offer of compromise  the question at heart must remain whether the unsuccessful party to the case pursued it unreasonably  having regard to the circumstances at any particular time  As the Full Court said in Amadio Pty Ltd v Henderson     FCR   at     It was argued that conditional offers should not have been treated by his Honour as Calderbank offers for the purpose of ordering indemnity costs  It is to be emphasised that the costs discretion is broad and is to be exercised in circumstances that will vary considerably from case to case  Whilst the criteria used in analogous circumstances will be of assistance it is simply wrong   to use such criteria as rules or tests governing the exercise of the discretion  Thus  an  imprudent  refusal or a  plainly unreasonable  refusal to accept an offer of settlement might  having regard to all the circumstances of the case  warrant the making of an order for indemnity costs if it is  just  to do so   However  such circumstances merely offer examples of where indemnity costs are ordered  Likewise  in some situations a conditional offer may be less likely to attract the Court s discretion to order indemnity costs than others  Much will depend upon the reasonableness of the offer and of   sic   the reasonableness of the conduct of the other party in refusing it having regard to all the circumstances of the case citedAustralian Competition   Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  These reasons for judgment concern issues of costs  On   May   I made orders dismissing the application in this proceeding  reserving questions of costs and giving directions about the filing of written submissions and the hearing of argument in relation to issues of costs  At that time  I also published reasons for judgment  very substantial in length  dealing with the principal issues in the proceeding  See Australian Competition   Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Ltd   FCA    It is convenient to refer to that judgment in these reasons for judgment as Leahy Petroleum    The proceeding in which that judgment was given involved allegations by the applicant  the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission  the ACCC  of contraventions of s   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   the Trade Practices Act   by a number of corporations engaged in retail selling of petrol in and around the City of Geelong  The corporations were alleged to have entered into  and to have given effect to  a series of arrangements or understandings that contravened s  A of the Trade Practices Act   because they contained provisions for the fixing  controlling or maintaining of prices of petrol  In addition  a number of natural persons were alleged to have been involved in the contraventions  The corporate respondents are identified in Leahy Petroleum at    Their respective relationships with the natural person respondents are set out in Leahy Petroleum at    For ease of reference  in these reasons for judgment  I propose to refer to the corporate respondents by their abbreviated names  in the same way as I referred to them in Leahy Petroleum   Similarly  I propose to refer to the natural person respondents by their names  The orders I make will reflect the way that the ACCC and the various respondents are described in the title to the proceeding   The power of the Court to award costs is conferred specifically by s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   the Federal Court Act    The effect of s   of the Federal Court Act is that  in a case such as the present  the award of costs is in the discretion of the Court  Courts have developed rules or principles to guide the exercise of the discretion in particular cases  Foremost among these is the rule or principle that costs should follow the event  ie  a party successful in litigation should be entitled to recover costs from an unsuccessful party  Similarly  there is a rule or principle that  when costs are awarded  they are normally awarded on a party party basis  Costs calculated on a party party basis do not provide anything like full compensation to the successful party for the expenditure incurred in prosecuting or defending the case successfully  Courts have therefore developed rules or principles to guide the exercise of the discretion in exceptional cases  so that costs calculated on a more compensatory basis  right up to a full indemnity  can be awarded if the circumstances justify such an order  Rules and principles are very helpful in determining whether an order for the payment of costs should be made at all  or what the basis of the calculation of costs ordered should be  They are not binding  however  and it must be recognised always that the Court exercises discretionary powers in relation to awarding costs  including the extent to which they should compensate the successful party for actual expenditure   The ACCC and several of the respondents have submitted consent orders in relation to costs  There is no reason not to make those orders  In relation to other respondents  the ACCC accepts in general that it should be required to pay the costs of the successful respondents who contested the proceeding  in the application of the rule or principle that costs follow the event  There are some respondents who entered into agreements with the ACCC during the course of the proceeding  prior to its trial  which agreements obliged those respondents to make full admissions as to contraventions of s   of the Trade Practices Act   to consent to orders being made against them  including orders for pecuniary penalties  declarations and injunctions  in some cases to give evidence on behalf of the ACCC at the trial  and to submit to orders that they pay costs to the ACCC  For reasons that I gave in Leahy Petroleum   at   I declined to make findings in accordance with the admissions made pursuant to those agreements  The ACCC has recognised that  in view of this  and of its lack of success despite the evidence given by some respondents pursuant to those agreements  it ought not to attempt to enforce the agreements so far as they obliged the parties to them to submit to orders for costs in favour of the ACCC  Some of those respondents have contended that they should be entitled to orders for costs against the ACCC  on the basis that such costs should follow the event  The ACCC has contended that there ought to be no order as to costs as between it and the successful respondents who were parties to such agreements  It is therefore necessary to resolve that issue   In addition  some of the respondents who contested the proceeding have asked the Court to order that the ACCC pay their costs on an indemnity basis  or on some other basis that would compensate them more fully than party party costs  for their expenditure on legal costs  either in respect of the entire proceeding  or in respect of part of it  Various arguments have been advanced in support of these applications  and various times during the trial have been advanced as appropriate points from which indemnity costs should be ordered in favour of different respondents  if they are not to receive indemnity costs in respect of the entire proceeding  It is also necessary to resolve these issues   On   June   the ACCC and Liberty filed a consent order to the effect that there be no order as to costs as between them  Similarly  on   June   the ACCC and Alan Shuvaly filed a consent order to the effect that there should be no order as to costs as between those parties   Ian Carmichael  Michael Warner and Eino Heikkila each entered into an agreement with the ACCC as to the outcome of the proceeding  I have referred to these agreements in Leahy Petroleum at      Mr Carmichael and Mr Warner each agreed to consent to orders in the terms of  or in similar terms to  those sought against them in the application in its original form  These included an order that the respondents pay the ACCC s costs of and incidental to the proceeding  Mr Heikkila s agreement was in a different form  In it  the ACCC agreed to accept costs of   from Mr Heikkila in respect of the proceeding  It should also be noted that Alan Shuvaly entered into an agreement with the ACCC similar to that entered into by Mr Carmichael and Mr Warner  but Mr Shuvaly has sought an order by consent involving no order as to costs as between himself and the ACCC   Much of the argument about whether the ACCC should be ordered to pay the costs of Mr Carmichael  Mr Warner and Mr Heikkila  or whether there should be no order as to costs between the ACCC and each of those respondents  was concerned with issues of contract law  Attempting to approach the issue in this way is unproductive  There can be little doubt that there was implicit in each agreement to pay the ACCC s costs a term that each of the respondents so agreeing would pay his own costs of the proceeding  This is not to say a great deal  however  The parties to each of the agreements acted on the assumption that the case would have a particular outcome  The agreement by each of the relevant respondents to pay his own costs of the proceeding rested on that assumption  Once that assumption is falsified  it is impossible to say that the parties would have been of a unified view as to what should happen in relation to the costs of those respondents  More than likely  they would have disagreed  as they now do  In those circumstances  it is impossible to find that each of the agreements contained an implied term that either party to it would pay the other s costs  or that costs would lie where they fell   Nor does the application of other principles of contract law assist in the resolution of the question whether orders for costs should be made in favour of the respondents who entered into costs agreements  The power of the Court to award  or to refrain from awarding  costs is not dependent upon what the parties concerned have agreed  It is therefore pointless to seek to determine whether the agreements have failed for want of a subject matter  and whether they could or should be set aside  as was suggested by counsel for Mr Heikkila  The same applies to suggestions that the Court should now attempt to determine whether the relevant respondents entered into agreements under duress  given that they lacked the resources necessary to defend the proceeding properly  or in consequence of a misrepresentation by the ACCC  to the effect that it had the evidence necessary to prove the case against them    With the benefit of hindsight  there is much in the applicant s preparation and conduct of the case about which it is possible to be critical  Plainly  the ACCC s investigators  and its legal representatives  were too carried away by the supposed correlation in the data the ACCC had collected between telephone calls and petrol price increases  Insufficient attention was given to the question whether such a correlation really existed  particularly in the light of the occasions recorded in the data summary  known as Annexure B  on which there were telephone calls without price increases  and on which there were price increases without telephone calls  I refer particularly to the analysis in Leahy Petroleum at     an analysis of the kind that should have been done prior to the commencement of the case  or at the very least prior to the trial  and should not have been left to the Court  It is most unfortunate that the leader of the ACCC s investigating team remained unaware of the ACCC s own report  entitled Reducing Fuel Price Variability  to which I have referred in Leahy Petroleum at     and   until she was being cross examined during the trial  If the investigators had taken into account the fact that the sawtooth pattern of movements in the retail price of petrol was common in Australia  and the various possible reasons advanced by the ACCC for that pattern  two things might have followed  They might not have made the assumption  which the principal investigator was reluctant to abandon in the witness box  that the only likely cause for such a pattern was collusion between petrol retailers  The investigators might also have been prepared to consider the possibility of a relationship between prices in the Geelong petrol market and those in the Melbourne petrol market  They might have taken a less Geelong centric view than they appear to have taken  See generally Leahy Petroleum at       It must be remembered that the ACCC prepared and pleaded its case without the knowledge  or even the expectation  that it would have available to it the evidence of Ian Carmichael  Michael Warner  Alan Shuvaly and Eino Heikkila  These four respondents only agreed to give evidence after the proceeding had been instituted  In its preparation for the trial  the ACCC gave far too little attention to the inconsistencies between the evidence that those witnesses were to give  and did in fact give  and the data in Annexure B  It only emerged in the course of the oral evidence that those witnesses had not been given an opportunity to examine the data before they went into the witness box  thereby exposing them to cross examination as to the inconsistencies  When I drew attention to this  pointing out that it was bound to lead to additional cross examination  counsel for the ACCC resorted to putting a handful of selected occasions to some of the subsequent witnesses  and inviting them to speculate as to how the data on those occasions might fit with their general recollections  This was a wholly inadequate attempt to deal with the relationship between the circumstantial evidence and the oral evidence  It appears to me to stem from a belief that the supposed correlation between telephone calls and petrol price increases was strong enough to make the case for the ACCC  irrespective of what the other evidence might have been   Two other inadequacies of the ACCC s case appear to have resulted from the same belief  One was the failure to lead evidence of the evolutionary origins of the alleged arrangements or understandings  particularly in circumstances in which there did not appear to have been sufficient time during which  or any pattern of events from which  the arrangements or understandings might possibly have evolved  See Leahy Petroleum at      The ACCC s investigators and representatives appear to have taken the view that the data in Annexure B would justify the Court in making findings that effect was given to arrangements or understandings  and would thereby justify findings that those arrangements or understandings existed  irrespective of the effect of the oral evidence  The other inadequacy was the failure of the ACCC s legal representatives to make any serious attempt to grapple with an essential element of an arrangement or understanding  labelled for convenience as  commitment   This inadequacy is dealt with in Leahy Petroleum at      The ACCC s case on this aspect required acceptance of the proposition that changes in the prices of petrol resulted from the implementation of arrangements or understandings  and that therefore such arrangements or understandings  including the requisite element of commitment  must exist   It is clear that closer attention to the content of the available evidence  and to its relationship with the elements that the ACCC was required to prove  in order to establish contraventions of s   of the Trade Practices Act   might well have led to the conclusion that the prospect of a successful outcome for the ACCC was not great enough to warrant the expenditure of money involved in the proceeding  Further  the need for such close analysis became greater as the trial advanced  with the inconsistencies between the circumstantial evidence and the oral evidence  and the absence of evidence about significant elements  becoming progressively more apparent  To make these criticisms is not to conclude the question whether costs should be awarded other than on a party party basis  however  The criticisms do not necessarily establish the proposition that it was unreasonable for the ACCC to commence the proceeding in the first place  or to pursue it to its end   The ACCC is a statutory body  established by s  A of the Trade Practices Act   It has a number of functions conferred on it  including functions of a regulatory nature  By s   of the Trade Practices Act   the ACCC may institute a proceeding in this Court for the recovery on behalf of the Commonwealth of a pecuniary penalty  The provisions for contravention of which pecuniary penalties may be imposed are listed in s    They include s    The ACCC is the only possible applicant for a pecuniary penalty  By other provisions of the Trade Practices Act   the ACCC may apply for other kinds of orders under the provisions of that Act  although its capacity to do so is not always exclusive of the capacity of other persons to apply for particular orders  For instance  under s     the ACCC or any other person may apply for an injunction in respect of a contravention of a number of provisions  including s    It is apparent that the ACCC has cast upon it significant responsibilities on behalf of the public  to ensure as far as practicable that there is compliance with the provisions of the Trade Practices Act   When the ACCC has commenced and pursued a proceeding in respect of alleged contraventions of a provision of the Trade Practices Act   and there is no suggestion that it has acted with any ulterior motive  the Court should not be quick to award costs against it on anything other than the usual party party basis when the ACCC has suffered a loss in the proceeding  Excessive readiness to force the ACCC to compensate the winning party to a greater extent than the normal party party costs incurred might operate as a deterrent to the ACCC against bringing proceedings in the exercise of its public functions   It is true that  at various points in the trial  I made comments that reflected the tentative views I had that the case was not proceeding in the way the ACCC had opened it  and that I could see difficulties in the evidence  particularly in the inconsistencies between the oral evidence and the circumstantial evidence in Annexure B  These comments cannot be taken as indicating that the ACCC was bound to lose  Indeed  the length of the reasons for judgment in Leahy Petroleum   paragraphs  and the detailed analysis of the evidence they contain  are inconsistent with the proposition that it was obvious that the ACCC would lose   For these reasons  it cannot be said that the case is generally one appropriate for indemnity costs  or for the award of costs on any basis other than the usual party party basis  There is an exception to this proposition that needs further attention   In relation to the alleged arrangement or understanding known as Arrangement No   the ACCC set itself a more difficult task in proving the existence of an arrangement or understanding  and that effect was given to it  than was the case with any other alleged arrangement or understanding in the proceeding  Arrangement No   was the only tripartite arrangement or understanding alleged  Each of the three parties it was alleged to involve  Apco  Liberty and Andrianopoulos  was a discount retailer of petrol  Each of Liberty and Andrianopoulos had only one petrol outlet in the Geelong retail petrol market area  Apco had a number of such outlets  Each of the three had a significant number of other petrol outlets in other parts of Victoria  Annexure B contained information about a very large number of telephone calls passing between Alan Shuvaly of Liberty and Christos Andrianopoulos of Andrianopoulos  as well as a substantial number of calls between Peter Anderson of Apco and either Mr Shuvaly or Mr Andrianopoulos  It would have required an extremely Geelong centric view to assume that all of these calls related to retail prices of petrol in the Geelong petrol market  This is especially so as the number of occasions on which the ACCC was prepared to allege that effect was given to Arrangement No   was quite small  when compared with the number of occasions on which it alleged that effect was given to some of the other alleged arrangements or understandings  Further  the occasions on which it was alleged that effect was given to Arrangement No   diminished in number significantly during the course of the trial  From the outset  Arrangement No   was far from the strongest aspect of the ACCC s case  In order to bolster it  the ACCC called Mr Shuvaly to give evidence  pursuant to the agreement to which I have referred between the ACCC and Mr Shuvaly  in   of these reasons for judgment and   of Leahy Petroleum   Mr Shuvaly gave evidence on the  th   th and  th days of the trial  Wednesday    August  Thursday    September and Friday    September    The evidence is summarised in Leahy Petroleum in      It did not go well for the ACCC  In fact  as is described in     counsel for the ACCC sought  and were granted  leave to cross examine Mr Shuvaly about a prior inconsistent statement  The cross examination was largely ineffective   After another witness had followed Mr Shuvaly into the witness box on   September   shortly before adjourning the proceeding at the end of the day  I raised with counsel for the ACCC the difficulty of establishing the existence of Arrangement No   and particularly the necessary element of commitment  by reference to Mr Shuvaly s evidence  I invited counsel for the ACCC  in conjunction with senior people from the ACCC  to give serious consideration to the way in which the case was put  because I was concerned about the expenditure of money involved   The trial resumed on the following Wednesday    September    Counsel for the ACCC therefore had sufficient time to consider the transcript of Mr Shuvaly s evidence  in the light of the relatively slight circumstantial evidence in relation to Arrangement No    In my view  they ought at that time to have realised that Mr Shuvaly s evidence would not assist them to prove the existence of Arrangement No   and that  in a number of significant respects  the evidence was inconsistent with the existence of an arrangement or understanding of the kind alleged as Arrangement No    In the light of the relatively scant circumstantial evidence on which the ACCC felt able to rely in suggesting that effect was given to Arrangement No   by the  th day of the trial    September   the ACCC ought to have realised that Arrangement No   was not going to be proved citedCalderbank v Calderbank     All ER   Another instance of an appropriate case is where one party has unreasonably refused an offer to compromise  The principle is derived from Calderbank v Calderbank     All ER    A party may set up a situation in which an award of indemnity costs is possible by making a reasonable offer of compromise in what is described as a  Calderbank letter  containing the terms of the offer and signifying that the letter will be relied upon to found an application for costs on an indemnity basis in the event that it turns out that the offer ought to have been accepted  To some extent  O   of the Federal Court Rules now codifies the circumstances in which refusal of an offer of compromise will found an application for indemnity costs  The area of law has become beset by technicality  much of which appears to me to be unnecessary  Arguments were raised in the present case about whether letters written by one party or another did or did not fit within what the authorities would regard as a Calderbank letter  In particular  it was said that there must be a true offer to compromise  involving the giving of something  and not merely a demand that the other party capitulate  I am by no means certain that this is a universal rule  Whatever the terms of any letter  or other means of conveying an offer of compromise  the question at heart must remain whether the unsuccessful party to the case pursued it unreasonably  having regard to the circumstances at any particular time  As the Full Court said in Amadio Pty Ltd v Henderson     FCR   at     It was argued that conditional offers should not have been treated by his Honour as Calderbank offers for the purpose of ordering indemnity costs  It is to be emphasised that the costs discretion is broad and is to be exercised in circumstances that will vary considerably from case to case  Whilst the criteria used in analogous circumstances will be of assistance it is simply wrong   to use such criteria as rules or tests governing the exercise of the discretion  Thus  an  imprudent  refusal or a  plainly unreasonable  refusal to accept an offer of settlement might  having regard to all the circumstances of the case  warrant the making of an order for indemnity costs if it is  just  to do so   However  such circumstances merely offer examples of where indemnity costs are ordered  Likewise  in some situations a conditional offer may be less likely to attract the Court s discretion to order indemnity costs than others  Much will depend upon the reasonableness of the offer and of   sic   the reasonableness of the conduct of the other party in refusing it having regard to all the circumstances of the case citedColgate Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd     FCR   There is no doubt that the Court has power to order indemnity costs  or costs assessed on a basis lying somewhere between indemnity costs and party party costs  in an appropriate case  It must be recognised that an appropriate case will only be one in which the circumstances justify the Court in departing from the usual rule that costs awarded will be calculated on a party party basis  It is impossible to provide a comprehensive definition of what is an appropriate case  In Colgate Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd     FCR   at     Sheppard J set out principles that his Honour derived from the authorities  Those principles are summarised in the judgment of the Full Court in Hamod v State of New South Wales   FCAFC       ALR   at       Indemnity costs are not designed to punish a party for persisting with a case that turns out to fail  They are not awarded as a means of deterring litigants from putting forward arguments that might be attended by uncertainty  Rather  they serve the purpose of compensating a party fully for costs incurred  as a normal costs order could not be expected to do  when the Court takes the view that it was unreasonable for the party against whom the order is made to have subjected the innocent party to the expenditure of costs citedFountain Selected Meats  Sales  Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd     ALR   One instance of an appropriate case for indemnity costs is described as follows by Woodward J in Fountain Selected Meats  Sales  Pty Ltd v International Produce Merchants Pty Ltd     ALR   at     I believe that it is appropriate to consider awarding  solicitor and client  or  indemnity  costs  whenever it appears that an action has been commenced or continued in circumstances where the applicant  properly advised  should have known that he had no chance of success  In such cases the action must be presumed to have been commenced or continued for some ulterior motive  or because of some wilful disregard of the known facts or the clearly established law  Such cases are  fortunately  rare  But when they occur  the court will need to consider how it should exercise its unfettered discretion citedHamod v State of New South Wales   FCAFC       ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  There is no doubt that the Court has power to order indemnity costs  or costs assessed on a basis lying somewhere between indemnity costs and party party costs  in an appropriate case  It must be recognised that an appropriate case will only be one in which the circumstances justify the Court in departing from the usual rule that costs awarded will be calculated on a party party basis  It is impossible to provide a comprehensive definition of what is an appropriate case  In Colgate Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd     FCR   at     Sheppard J set out principles that his Honour derived from the authorities  Those principles are summarised in the judgment of the Full Court in Hamod v State of New South Wales   FCAFC       ALR   at       Indemnity costs are not designed to punish a party for persisting with a case that turns out to fail  They are not awarded as a means of deterring litigants from putting forward arguments that might be attended by uncertainty  Rather  they serve the purpose of compensating a party fully for costs incurred  as a normal costs order could not be expected to do  when the Court takes the view that it was unreasonable for the party against whom the order is made to have subjected the innocent party to the expenditure of costs consideredHickman v Berens     Ch   The question remains whether costs should follow the event  so that the ACCC should be ordered to pay the costs of Mr Carmichael  Mr Warner and Mr Heikkila  in the application of the usual principle  or whether there is something in the circumstances of the case that would warrant departure from that principle  The researches of counsel  and my own researches  have not revealed the existence of any authority that is of great assistance  The nearest is perhaps Hickman v Berens     Ch    In that case  the plaintiff applied to set aside an agreement to compromise a proceeding  on the ground that no consensus had existed as to the basis of the agreement  An official referee declined to set aside the agreement  Kekewich J dismissed an appeal from the official referee s decision  The Court of Appeal allowed an appeal from the judgment of Kekewich J  At   Lindley LJ  with whom Lopes LJ and Rigby LJ agreed  said    With regard to the costs  the plaintiff ought to pay the costs of the summons and hearing before the official referee to set aside the mistake  the mistake being on the part of the plaintiff  The order of Kekewich J  must be discharged  and there must be no costs of either side  either of the appeal to him or of the appeal to us  We take that to be as near justice in the matter of costs as is possible   Of course  in the present case  there is no application to set aside the compromise agreements  and no such application is needed  The Court has simply declined to give effect to the agreements  so far as they committed the relevant respondents to consenting to orders of the Court  In the light of that  the ACCC  properly in my view  has accepted that it should not seek to enforce those agreements in so far as they require consent to orders for  or the actual payment of  the ACCC s costs      In my view  as in Hickman v Berens   the justice of the case with respect to costs is that there should be no order as to costs as between the ACCC and the respondents who entered into agreements  It appears to me that there were mistakes on both sides in relation to the agreements  I do not know what the ACCC s cooperation policy  in accordance with which it is said that the agreements were made  says in detail  It does seem to me  however  that the ACCC needs to be more aware of the disparity that may exist between itself and opposing parties with whom it proposes to enter into agreements of this kind  in terms of the resources available to contest litigation  The legal costs of defending a proceeding may be so great as to induce respondents to be more ready than they should to concede all that the ACCC claims against them  when the claims may in truth be unfounded  or some good defence may exist  In addition  the ACCC needs to recognise that large scale litigation often has a profound effect on the lives of people who are caught up in it  an effect much greater than that suffered by those who manage large corporations caught up in similar litigation  The present case is a good example of the need for caution in accepting total capitulation  On the other hand  there was no obligation on the part of any respondent to enter into an agreement with the ACCC as to the outcome of the case  Each of Mr Carmichael  Mr Warner and Mr Heikkila opted to do so  after receiving legal advice  One alternative was to play no significant part in the trial  as Colin Williamson did  He will now be the beneficiary of an order that the ACCC pay his costs of the proceeding as a successful respondent  Another possible option might be to defend the case in person  perhaps with some coaching from a legal adviser  In the present case  without the oral evidence of Mr Carmichael  Mr Warner and Mr Heikkila  the ACCC s case would have depended even more on the circumstantial evidence  particularly the alleged relationship between telephone calls and petrol price increases  than it did  A detailed analysis of that data  together with evidence produced by the cross examination of such other witnesses as the ACCC called would have made clear some of the weaknesses of the ACCC s case   Plainly  the result of the case has falsified the assumption on which the ACCC and each of the relevant parties entered into the agreements  namely that there had in fact been unlawful price fixing in the Geelong petrol market  In the circumstances  the justice of the case seems to me to require that there be no order as to costs as between the ACCC and the parties who entered into the agreements  It is significant that this view appears to have commended itself to both the ACCC and Mr Shuvaly  who have consented to an order that no order for costs be made as between them  despite the fact that there was an agreement between them that dealt with the question of costs
