order sought and the grounds relied upon in support of the order sought  This final requirement calls for a brief statement explaining why the answer to the question  or questions  of law will lead to the making of the order sought   At the first directions hearing I drew the attention of Mrs Brown s counsel to the fact that there were recent Full Court authorities touching on appeals under s   of the AAT Act and referred him to the Etheridge judgment in particular  There was an exchange between us concerning the proper formulation of a question of law  the requirements of O   r   of the Federal Court Rules and the alternative source of jurisdiction provided by s   of the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act    Cth   the ADJR Act   Counsel disavowed any wish to rely on the ADJR Act but sought  and was granted  leave to file and serve an amended notice of appeal pursuant to s   of the AAT Act   The amended notice of appeal purports to identify the following questions of law          Whether the Tribunal  in determining that the death of the veteran within the meaning of  death  in sections   and   of the Act  and the only kind of death within the meaning of  kind of death  in section  A of the Act  was from non Hodgkins lymphoma  mistook the evidence given by Dr Edwards                  Further or in the alternative to paragraph     whether  on the proper construction of  death  as that term appears in sections   and   of the Act and  kind of death  as that term appears in section  A of the Act  and given purported reliance by the Tribunal upon the evidence given by Dr Edwards  the meaning of those terms necessitated the Tribunal finding that the  death  and or  kind of death  of the veteran was or included death from pneumonia related infection                  Whether the Tribunal afforded procedural fairness to the parties when it decided that the veteran had suffered a  kind of death  different from the  kind of death  put to it by the parties   As counsel for the applicant conceded at hearing  question     is not a question of law  What was the understanding of the Tribunal on any issue is a question of fact  It is not appropriate for the Court on an appeal under s   to undertake a comparison of the Tribunal s understanding of a particular issue with the evidence adduced before it for the purpose of determining whether the Tribunal misunderstood the evidence  Question     is therefore incapable of constituting the subject matter  or part of the subject matter  of an appeal under s   of the AAT Act   Question     is not easy to understand  It appears to involve some questions of law  ie the proper construction of statutory expressions  However  it also appears to call for an evaluation of the evidence given by Dr Edwards  It is thus a mixed question of fact and law and  for this reason  not a question of law within the meaning of s   of the AAT Act  see Etheridge at    Therefore  it is also incapable of constituting the subject matter  or part of the subject matter  of an appeal under s   of the AAT Act   Question     is intended to raise for consideration whether the decision of the Tribunal should be set aside because the Tribunal       a  was obliged to afford Mrs Brown procedural fairness  and   b  failed to do so in that it reached the conclusion that the kind of death suffered by Mr Brown was non Hodgkin s lymphoma when that conclusion was not urged on the Tribunal by either Mrs Brown or the Repatriation Commission   Sitting alone I am bound by the majority decision of the Full Court

at      See also Purvis esp at   citedDrake v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALR   The suggestion that the Tribunal failed to afford Mrs Brown procedural fairness in respect of its decision that the kind of death met by Mr Brown was non Hodgkin s lymphoma is fully met by the above extracts from the hearing transcript  An administrative tribunal such as the AAT is not obliged to accept a submission put to it jointly by the parties to a dispute  The duty of the AAT is to make the correct or preferable decision in the circumstances   Drake v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALR     The above extracts from the Tribunal hearing reveal that the Tribunal let the parties know the approach that it proposed to take  and gave them an opportunity to be heard on whether it should find that the kind of death met by Mr Brown was pneumonia  The Tribunal could hardly have made it plainer that  if it concluded that pneumonia was simply a terminating event in Mr Brown s death  it was unlikely to find that he met a  pneumonia kind of death   The respondent s representative showed his appreciation of the approach foreshadowed by the Tribunal in the statement reproduced in  c  above   Mrs Brown was not denied procedural fairness by the Tribunal in the way alleged in paragraph     of the amended notice of appeal or at all referred toHBF Health Fund Inc v
