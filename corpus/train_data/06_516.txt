Disputed issues of fact which underlie proceedings are subjacent to the pleadings  Fried v National Australian Bank Ltd   FCA    As the joinder of Ms Nader is based upon affidavit evidence served in support of the existing pleadings  the case against Ms Nader is a matter currently in dispute in the proceedings   The structure of Order   is such that it gives primacy to O   r   over rules such as O   r   although cognately they have been held to give the Court very wide powers  John Cooke   Co Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   at   per Knox CJ  Gavan  Duffy and Starke JJ  The only

 and they undoubtedly give the Court very wide powers  But they are discretionary in their nature   See Wilson  Sons   Co  v  Balcarres Brook Steamship Co  and Russian Commercial and Industrial Bank v

parties to the action are not before it   see Robinson v  Geisel   at p     The Rules  too  enable the Court to add parties who ought to have been joined or whose presence before the Court is necessary to enable it to effectually and completely adjudicate upon and settle all the questions involved in the cause or matter    footnotes omitted  I am of opinion that O   r   on its proper construction  does not authorize the joinder of Ms Nader as sought  Her joinder would require  as is sought  substantive amendment of the Bank s statement of claim  Save for the assertion of her liability if the Bank s remedies against the guarantors in contract  pursuant to its interest in land the subject of its mortgages and its tortuous and statutory claims fail  Ms Nader has no interest in the subject matter of the Bank proceedings or the ASS proceedings  She is a discrete third party quite unlike the wool growers  for example  in John Cooke   Co Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth   HCA

the same transaction or series of transactions  involving some common question of law or fact  These provisions reflect an intention  which now receives more emphasis than in the past  to avoid where reasonably practicable a multiplicity of proceedings  Montgomery v Foy  Morgan   Co     QB   but see Amon v Raphael Tuck   Sons Ltd     QB   at   per Devlin J  followeddiscussedPayne v Young   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Payne v Young   HCA         CLR   the High Court considered its analogical rule which  as Barwick CJ emphasized   CLR at   spoke of       plaintiffs in whom any right to relief is alleged to exist   The operation of O   r  a ii  is different and less liberal for it requires   all the rights to relief   to be in respect of or to arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions   Here the rights to relief claimed by the Bank against Ms Nader are legally and factually independent of the claims by the Bank against the guarantors other than Marie and Josephine Saklaoui for the purposes of O   r  a  because none of the other guarantors participated in the transactions between each of Marie and Josephine Saklaoui  Ms Nader and the Bank  As Mason J said in Payne v Young   HCA         CLR   at    see too per Barwick CJ at     Stephen J at   and Aickin J  whose decision at first instance was affirmed  at   of the amendment to the English rules in      The object of the amendment was to allow several plaintiffs to join separate causes of action where under the old rule as interpreted by judicial decision they could not do so  Subject to the two limitations expressed in pars   a  and  b  of the rule  it permits the joinder of separate causes of action which have accrued to different plaintiffs  The effect of the rule was  in my opinion  correctly stated by Vaughan Williams L J  in Stroud v Lawson when he said     QB at pp              I do not think that the rule means that the whole of a transaction must be involved in each of the causes of action joined  I think that  if there was a transaction or series of transactions in respect of which one plaintiff was interested up to a certain point  and other plaintiffs were interested  not only up to that point  but in respect of the entire transaction or series of transactions from beginning to end  under this rule they might joint their separate causes of action in one action  because there would be one transaction or series of transactions in respect of which the various plaintiffs all claimed a right to relief  Their remedies or damages might be different  but they would be claiming relief in respect of the same transaction or series of transactions           To these observations I would add the comment that the rule may well authorize the joinder of separate causes of action accruing to various plaintiffs against different defendants  so long as the causes of action arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions      The consequence is that under par   a  of the rule joinder of separate causes of action accruing to different plaintiffs is authorized when the relief claimed is in respect of  or arises out of  the same or a particular series of transactions  Joinder is not authorized when the relief claimed is in respect of  or arises out of  two or more different series of transactions  when the participation of each individual plaintiff is limited to participation in one series of transactions  the other plaintiffs not participating in that series   The Bank argued that the requisite commonality was to be found in the fact that it sued all guarantors on a common debt which they jointly guaranteed or in which they were concerned and that this distinguished its case from Payne v Young   HCA         CLR     But here  the Bank s claim against each guarantor and  in particular  against each of Marie and Josephine Saklaoui  depended on its having entered into relationships based in contract and in interests in land   viz   its mortgages   That is  the Bank relies on the reality and validity of those dealings as its primary case  Next  the Bank has now been given leave to amend to allege against  inter alios   Marie and Josephine Saklaoui  that each was guilty of fraud in proffering her guarantee  mortgage and signature of the certificate when  on this alternative  there will be no real or valid guarantee or mortgage   Obviously  the two above ways of the Bank putting its case against the guarantors are distinct and involve different transactions or series of transactions  This not just because of the legal distinction between a claim under a valid and binding guarantee and or mortgage  and a claim that the Bank was the victim of a fraud because those instruments have been avoided or were void ab initio   It is also because there are six different guarantors  each with his or her own circumstances and  in substance  cases within the overall context of the Bank proceedings followedPerpetual Trustee Co Ltd v Khoshaba   NSWCA  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  It is not alleged that Ms Nader acted as an agent for the Bank  so the question will be  after a finding is made about what explanation  if any  was given  how that affects the Bank s entitlement in all the circumstances to enforce the guarantees and mortgages against Marie and Josephine Saklaoui  A myriad of other discretionary factors will fall to be considered  Indeed  even if Ms Nader gave no explanation  there may be circumstances in which the Bank could succeed in its claim to enforce its contractual and real property rights  such as if Marie and or Josephine Saklaoui from past experience knew what a guarantee or mortgage was and that she was executing such an instrument fully cognizant of the potential consequences for her in doing so  Relief under s   of the Contracts Review Act    NSW  is potentially available because the court can hold a contract to be unjust as Basten JA recently said in Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd v Khoshaba   NSWCA   at           by reliance on factors of which the other party was ignorant when the contract was entered into  but that such ignorance may be relevant in determining whether to grant relief    see too per Spigelman CJ at   In some cases it may be desirable or convenient to join as a party a person in Ms Nader s position  but that addition  in the present  complex  matter  in my opinion  is not necessary to ensure that all matters in dispute in these proceedings can be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon under O   r  b   The enforceability of the guarantees and mortgages can be determined once for all  subject to any appeal  without the need to join  or the joinder of  Ms Nader   Indeed  the significant amendments required if Ms Nader was joined  demonstrate that her addition as a party would expand the matters in dispute  albeit that this would occur because the claim against her is in the alternative to the principal claims against some of the guarantors citedProgressive Mailing House Pty Ltd v Tabali Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Here  however  no circuity of action would be avoided by the joinder of Ms Nader  The claim against her is freestanding and depends on the Bank s other independent claims against the guarantors with whom it had relationships based in contract and the law of  real  property  cp Progressive Mailing House Pty Ltd v Tabali Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     per Mason J   Of course  the Bank also now claims against the guarantors in tort and pursuant to statute  It is because these latter claims are made and the Bank also seeks to sue Ms Nader on a quite distinct  alternate  basis for like causes of action  that it applied to join her followeddiscussedQantas Airways Ltd v AF Little Pty Ltd     NSWLR   At the hearing the principles upon which I was

Qantas Airways Ltd v AF Little Pty Ltd     NSWLR   at  G  B   D E  Glass JA noted that the analogue of s   was also directed to avoid multiplicity of proceedings  He said that the fact that the constitution of the proceedings prior to the joinder of the new party by a plaintiff  or applicant  could not yield an order which directly affected that new party was no answer to the application  This was because r  a  and the analogue of s   sanctioned and encouraged the addition of a further defendant  or respondent  to avoid multiplicity of proceedings  He continued by construing r  a  as not being limited  on a plaintiff s  or applicant s  motion to join a new party  to the matters arising on the existing pleadings     NSWLR at  C E  but he did not decide the case under r       NSWLR at  A  E    In the case before the Court of Appeal there was an issue on the existing pleadings as to whose default had caused a building to be unstable  Glass JA there said that where a plaintiff  or applicant  asserted on tenable grounds that such a matter of dispute could not be determined without the joinder of the builder as a party  the power to join that person as a party under r   was enlivened     NSWLR at  D E   In Qantas Airways Ltd v AF Little Pty Ltd     NSWLR   the nomination of the builder as the person whose alleged default occasioned the building s instability  was to be seen as a joint or several tortfeasor along with the current defendants who were the architects and engineers  A claim in contract was also made     NSWLR at  A G    The Bank contended that this showed that Branson J s approach to O   r   was wrong and  moreover  it submitted that the approach of Glass and Samuels JJA had been approved by the Full Court in News Ltd v Australian Rugby Football League     FCR   at  G  B  But there  the Full Court referred simply to the decision in Qantas Airways Ltd v AF Little Pty Ltd     NSWLR   in the context of considering a different situation  viz   one in which the trial judge had made orders that affected the substantive rights of persons who had not been joined to the proceedings  see   FCR at  E F   Lockhart  von Doussa and Sackville JJ did say   FCR at  A B  immediately after their reference in the above context to the decision of the Court of Appeal and FCR O   r  b     The post Judicature Act rules of court also included provisions of the kind now found in FCR O   rr   and   for the joinder of multiple claims and multiple parties  either plaintiffs or defendants  where the subject matter of the proceedings is in respect of  or arises out of  the same transaction or series of transactions  involving some common question of law or fact  These provisions reflect an intention  which now receives more emphasis than in the past  to avoid where reasonably practicable a multiplicity of proceedings  Montgomery v Foy  Morgan   Co     QB   but see Amon v Raphael Tuck   Sons Ltd     QB   at   per Devlin J   I am of opinion that O   r   on its proper construction  does not authorize the joinder of Ms Nader as sought  Her joinder would require  as is sought  substantive amendment of the Bank s statement of claim  Save for the assertion of her liability if the Bank s remedies against the guarantors in contract  pursuant to its interest in land the subject of its mortgages and its tortuous and statutory claims fail  Ms Nader has no interest in the subject matter of the Bank proceedings or the ASS proceedings  She is a discrete third party quite unlike the wool growers  for example  in John Cooke   Co Pty Ltd v The

litigation is no mere game of chess to be lost by one false move      and that errors are  usually  curable  That is certainly the case  and in instances involving the related  but distinct

though Ms Nader now has sworn an affidavit  every witnesses  memory is likely to have been affected and that  in turn  may affect her position adversely  As Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone LC said  albeit in the context of a criminal trial but none less apposite to a civil trial  in Reg  v Lawrence   AC   at  B C         it is a truism to say that justice delayed is justice denied  But it is not merely the anxiety and uncertainty in the life of the accused  whether on bail or remand  which are affected  Where there is delay the whole quality of justice deteriorates  Our system depends on the recollection of witnesses  conveyed to a jury by oral testimony  As the months pass  this recollection necessarily dims  and juries who are correctly directed not to convict unless they are assured of the reliability of the evidence for the prosecution  necessarily tend to acquit as this becomes less precise  and sometimes less reliable  This may also affect defence witnesses on the opposite side   His Lordship s observations apply a fortiori to the present application  The risk of injustice being done to the Bank  has to be balanced against the risk of injustice being done to Ms Nader in the context of this particular litigation and the way it has been conducted to the present time  The joinder of Ms Nader  if she is to have adequate time in which to prepare and investigate the case which she may or may not wish to pursue involving the ASS proceedings  does not appear to be one which can be regarded as a simple task  The whole history of the litigation has indicated that it is not  For Ms Nader to prepare fully in that respect will cause delay in the prosecution of the case against all of the other parties  It may cause her injustice by being hurried on  The Bank has only itself to blame for its inability to appreciate from March   until October   what appears to be plain in the defence of Marie and Josephine Saklaoui   The fact that her affidavit evidence is available to be used  if the Bank so chooses  in the Bank proceedings reduces but does not entirely eliminate the potential prejudice to the Bank flowing from a decision to refuse the present application  Doing the best that I can on the evidence before me  the interests of justice will be better served by exposing the Bank to this prejudice rather than exposing Ms Nader to what I consider to be far more substantive prejudice to her referred toReview Australia Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd     IPR   At the hearing the principles upon which I was asked to exercise my discretion in granting

nothing until late October   after receiving the affidavits of Marie and Josephine Saklaoui in November    That is a sufficient reason to refuse the relief sought  cp  Review Australia Pty Ltd v

Bank  the first to fifth respondents in the Bank proceedings and Ms Nader provided on   April     As the passage just cited shows  the analogue of O   r   enabled the court to add a party  then limited to a defendant  where the interests of that party would be affected by the result of the proceedings as they were presently framed  Moreover  it enables the court to add a party where there are common questions of fact or law involved in different causes of action  but the context is  as Williams J said in Richardson v Trautwein   HCA         CLR   at    and see too at       of an analogue of O   r   again limited to joinder of a defendant     It authorizes the joinder of defendants against whom the right to any relief is alleged to exist jointly  severally  or in the alternative  The causes of action upon which this right to relief could be founded have already been specified  The rule is therefore silent as to causes of action  because rule   has already dealt with those which can be combined in the one action  Rule   marks the arrival of the stage at which it becomes necessary to define the defendants who can be joined in such action      His Honour emphasized that these rules are to be construed liberally to authorize the joinder of actions that can be conveniently tried together with safeguards to prevent defendants being prejudiced   CLR at     And  this construction is reinforced by O   r  b  which permits orders for amendment  in effect  consequent upon the joinder of a new party under O   r   see also Richardson v Trautwein     CLR at   per Williams J and Australian Coastal Shipping Commission v Curtis Cruising Pty Ltd     NSWLR   at  E  C per Mahoney JA  see too at  F  C per Priestley JA  So  O   r   has to do  primarily  with ensuring that the rules of natural justice  entitling a person whose rights may be affected by a decision to be heard before the decision is made  and ensuring that any proper contradictor can be joined so as to assist in the court s discharge of its statutory obligation under s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   That provides     The Court shall  in every matter before the Court  grant  either absolutely or on such terms and conditions as the Court thinks just  all remedies to which any of the parties appears to be entitled in respect of a legal or equitable claim properly brought forward by him or her in the matter  so that  as far as possible  all matters in controversy between the parties may be completely and finally determined and all multiplicity of proceedings concerning any of those matters avoided   At first blush  the proposed claim against Ms Nader might have the requisite commonality under O   r  a  only with the Bank s cases against Marie and Josephine Saklaoui  But that argument does not stand examination  for the Bank s  transactions  with Marie and Josephine Saklaoui are quite different from its transactions with the other guarantors  if for no other reason than the involvement of Ms Nader  But there are also other reasons for the distinctiveness of the transactions so as to entail that they do not satisfy O   r  a ii   The proposed claim against Ms Nader is framed against her as an individual who is alleged to be solely liable for her own alleged fraud and other tortuous and statutory liabilities  all of which depend on a finding that each of the transaction or transactions on the face of the guarantees  mortgages and certificates was not as it appeared  viz   valid  correct and enforceable  see too Richardson v

Tribunal  Ex Parte  HD Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at    The first basis  in r  a  involves considerations which have been the subject of over a century of judicial decisions  It requires not just the existence of a common question of fact or law in each proceeding which might be brought separately against two or more persons  but also that   all rights to relief claimed  are in respect of or arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions  cf  Stroud v Lawson     QB   at     Here the rights to relief claimed by the Bank against Ms Nader are legally and factually independent of the claims by the Bank against the guarantors other than Marie and Josephine Saklaoui for the purposes of O   r  a  because none of the other guarantors participated in the transactions between each of Marie and Josephine Saklaoui  Ms Nader and the Bank  As Mason J said in Payne v Young   HCA         CLR   at    see too per Barwick CJ at     Stephen J at   and Aickin J  whose decision at first instance was affirmed  at   of the amendment to the English rules in      The object of the amendment was to allow several plaintiffs to join separate causes of action where under the old rule as interpreted by judicial decision they could not do so  Subject to the two limitations expressed in pars   a  and  b  of the rule  it permits the joinder of separate causes of action which have accrued to different plaintiffs  The effect of the rule was  in my opinion  correctly stated by Vaughan Williams L J  in Stroud v Lawson when he said     QB at pp              I do not think that the rule means that the whole of a transaction must be involved in each of the causes of action joined  I think that  if there was a transaction or series of transactions in respect of which one plaintiff was interested up to a certain point  and other plaintiffs were interested  not only up to that point  but in respect of the entire transaction or series of transactions from beginning to end  under this rule they might joint their separate causes of action in one action  because there would be one transaction or series of transactions in respect of which the various plaintiffs all claimed a right to relief  Their remedies or damages might be different  but they would be claiming relief in respect of the same transaction or series of transactions           To these observations I would add the comment that the rule may well authorize the joinder of separate causes of action accruing to various plaintiffs against different defendants  so long as the causes of action arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions      The consequence is that under par   a  of the rule joinder of separate causes of action accruing to different plaintiffs is authorized when the relief claimed is in respect of  or arises out of  the same or a particular series of transactions  Joinder is not authorized when the relief claimed is in respect of  or arises out of  two or more different series of transactions  when the participation of each individual plaintiff is limited to participation in one series of transactions  the other plaintiffs not participating in that series   In Stroud v Lawson     QB   the plaintiff sued four defendants  three individuals and a company  Two causes of action were pleaded  first that the three individuals had by deceit induced the plaintiff to become a member of the company  Secondly  the plaintiff sued all four defendants  not in his personal capacity but on behalf of himself and all other shareholders in the company  seeking to have the payment of a dividend declared ultra vires as being paid out of capital  not profits  and claiming that the individual defendants should pay the money back to the company  Chitty LJ observed that in substance there were two plaintiffs claiming on two separate and distinct causes of action     QB at     even though the payment of the impugned dividend was one of the fraudulent devices which were said to have induced the plaintiff to become a shareholder  The distinctness of capacities is now addressed by O   r   but the reasoning is still relevant for present purposes   As AL Smith LJ said     QB at     according to the terms of the analogical predecessor of O   r   the plaintiff could not join the two causes of action which he put in different capacities unless they both arose out of the same transaction  His Lordship continued     The right to relief which he claims in a representative capacity in the second part of the statement of claim is quite independent of any fraud on the part of the defendants  The two causes of action and the nature of the relief claimed are wholly distinct and separate   For present purposes  the reasoning of Chitty LJ is also helpful  He said     QB at   and Vaughan Williams LJ took the same approach at      The mere circumstance that he makes the declaration and payment of a dividend out of capital an element in the fraud alleged as the basis of the first mentioned cause of action does not in my opinion shew that the two causes of action arise out of the same transaction  It seems to me that they arise out of different transactions  though they have that one feature in common  followedThe Queen v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal  Ex Parte  HD Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  That said  it is now
