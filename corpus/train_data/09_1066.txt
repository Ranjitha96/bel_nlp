National Australia Bank Ltd v State of New South Wales  includes Addendum dated   September     FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmldiscussedAttorney General of Ontario v Mercer     App Cas  The foundation of land tenure in Australian law was identified by Brennan J  with whom Mason CJ and McHugh J expressly agreed  in Mabo v Queensland  No     HCA         CLR   at     as being derived from the grant of tenure of some kind by the Crown  see too at   per Deane and Gaudron JJ  Brennan J said that one incident of such tenure was the Crown s right to escheat  Mabo   CLR at   see too at   per Deane and Gaudron JJ  And in Wik Peoples v Queensland     CLR   at     Brennan CJ explained that the doctrines of tenure  of which escheat is an incident  and of estate  ensure that no land in which the Crown has granted an interest is ever without a legal owner  Escheat was abolished in England by s  d  of Administration of Estates Act    Imp   What escheat involves at common law was elegantly explained by the Earl of Selborne LC giving the opinion of the Judicial Committee in Attorney General of Ontario v Mercer     App Cas   at    First  the Lord Chancellor quoted the following from Coke on Littleton  a         Escheat  is a word of art  and signifieth properly when by accident the lands fall to the lord of whom they are holden  in which case we say the fee is escheated        His Lordship then continued       The writ of escheat  when the tenant died without heirs  was in this form    The King to the Sheriff   c  Command A    c   that he render to B  ten acres of land  with the appurtenances  in N   which C  held of him  and which ought to revert to him  the said B   as his escheat  for that the said C  died without heirs   F  N  B     F    If there was a mesne lord  the escheat was to him  if not  to the King          From the use of the word  revert  in the writ of escheat  is manifestly derived the language of some authorities which speak of escheat as a species of  reversion   There cannot  in the usual and proper sense of the term  be a reversion expectant upon an estate in fee simple  What is meant is that  when there is no longer any tenant  the land returns  by reason of tenure  to the lord by whom  or by whose predecessors in title  the tenure was created  Other writers speak of the lord as taking it by way of succession or inheritance  as if from the tenant  which is certainly not accurate  The tenant s estate  subject to any charges upon it which he may have created  has come to an end  and the lord is in by his own right  In addition  given that now such disclaimers and vesting orders occur under laws of the Commonwealth  the question may arise as to whether any escheat or remaining interest in the property after a disclaimer should be treated as falling into the Crown in right of the Commonwealth rather than the State  cf Attorney General of Ontario   App Cas    And  in The King v Attorney General of British Columbia   AC   at     esp at   Lord Sumner observed that the principles upon which escheat and bona vacantia fall to the Crown are that where there is no private person entitled  the Crown takes  see too Land Law   th ed  where at pp     Professor Butt suggests that the only remnants in Australia of the doctrine of escheat are in the case of disclaimers by trustees in bankruptcy or liquidators  Because s   of the Bankruptcy Act preserves the possibility that the Court may vest disclaimed property in a person these doctrines may not operate in an unqualified way in the current legislative scheme  Once again  this is not the occasion to decide these questions  but they will require attention at some time  The title to the bankrupt s former landcitedBathurst City Council v

citedFiggins Holdings Pty Ltd v SEAA Enterprises Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlUnder s   the proprietor of an estate or interest in land under the provisions of the RP Act intended to be charged with or made security for the payment of a debt must execute a mortgage in the approved form  By force of s   the mortgage has effect as a security but does not operate as a transfer of the land mortgaged or charged  unlike the position at common law  see too Figgins Holdings Pty Ltd v SEAA Enterprises Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     per Gaudron  Gummow and Callinan JJ   Importantly  where a mortgagee wishes to exercise a power of sale based on default in payment under  or compliance with  the mortgage  the mortgagee must first serve on the mortgagor a notice under s  b   If no notice is duly served under s  b  then ss     and  A do not permit the mortgagee to exercise the power of sale  But  the RP Act is silent as to the remedy of a mortgagee that has not served a notice that authorises it to exercise a power of sale prior to a disclaimer by the registered proprietor s trustee in bankruptcy  The current problem The obligations to pay the amounts secured by the mortgagee were personal to the mortgagors  here  the bankrupts  Thus  the State  as the present registered proprietor of the land cannot be given a notice under s  b  by the bank  This is because the State has no obligation under the mortgage even though its estate or interest is subject to the charge created by the bank s registration as mortgagee to secure repayment of what it was owed by the bankrupts  The State attended for a short time at the hearing but did not appear  However  it consented to the application made by the bank to become registered as proprietor of the land in order to sell it to a purchaser who will be entitled to be registered as proprietor of an estate in the land in fee simple  The bank intends to pay to the trustee in bankruptcy any surplus realised from the sale after the sums secured by the mortgagee have been repaid  Despite this cooperative conduct  the legal basis for achieving this simple goal requires some analysis because of the interaction between the laws of the State and the Commonwealth when property affected by the incidents of State law is disclaimed by its owner  as trustee in bankruptcy  under the Bankruptcy Act   Did the land escheat However  as all judges since Jessel MR have recognised  the question of where the title goes after a disclaimer is as clear as mud  The device of treating the title as going to the Crown in right of the State  or Territory  in which the property is located may be convenient  so long as it respects the source whence it derives  namely  in a bankruptcy  s   of the Bankruptcy Act  or Div  A of Pt     of the Corporations Act   and the intention of the Parliament of the Commonwealth that this title in the Crown is not absolute or by escheat  This result can be accommodated by its limited interaction with Torrens title legislation  and the special position created with the  temporary  repository of the title  namely the Crown  pending the final decision of the Court as to the person in whom the title will vest  cf Figgins   CLR at          This is an incident of the conferral of jurisdiction on the Court to decide these questions  It is not appropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction on or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not to be found in the express words of the legislation  Owners of

the Bankruptcy Act    Imp  Sir George Jessel MR despaired that there was no one entitled to take the estate except the Crown  and continued in In re Mercer and Moore     Ch D   at          This  however  is no way of getting out of the difficulty indeed you get into a worse difficulty here  for how are you to get the estate out of the Crown again  There are no means that I know of except by actual grant or by the will of the Crown to get back a legal estate  which would be a very awkward result and very prejudicial to many titles in this part of the country  especially where these titles are very common  If that is not so  I do not know where the estate is  After noting up these difficulties with the operation of the doctrine his Lordship commented      As I have said before  I am not sure here that the estate is in the Crown  but if it is not in the Crown I do not know where it is  At all events it is not in the trustee in bankruptcy  and has not been conveyed  therefore  to the present vendors  Therefore they cannot convey to the present purchasers  I have looked into the Trustee Act   and I do not see any mode of getting in the legal estate  The Trustee Act does not provide for want of an heir  The English legislation provided that after a disclaimer  any person interested in any disclaimed property could apply to the court and it could make orders for the possession of

proceeds of sale  all moneys to which it would have been entitled assuming that there had been no disclaimer had it sold exercising its power of sale  to the intent that the land will answer as secure for all interest  fees and other moneys that would have been secured by the mortgage  The bank should be entitled to deduct those sums from the proceeds of sale as if there had not been a disclaimer and the mortgage had continued to secure the debts and liabilities of the bankrupts or their estates  The bank should apply the sale proceeds in the manner provided in s   of the RP Act accounting to the trustee in bankruptcy for any surplus namely       The purchase money to arise from the sale of any such land  estate  or interest  shall be applied  first  in payment of the expenses occasioned by such sale  secondly  in payment of the moneys which may then be due or owing to the mortgagee  chargee or covenant chargee  thirdly  in payment of subsequent mortgages  charges or covenant charges  if any  in the order of their priority  and the surplus  if any  shall be paid to the mortgagor  charger or covenant charger  as the case may be  I will also require the bank to provide accounts of how it has dealt with the sale proceeds to the State and the Registrar  I will direct the bank to bring in short minutes to give effect to these reasons   I certify that the preceding thirty one

Bowen CJ in Eq in Re Middle Harbour Investments Ltd and the Companies Act     NSWLR   at  A G  see too at  G  G  and Needham J in Re Tulloch Ltd   ACLR at      followed by Madgwick J in In the Matter

Bila CDEP Ltd  deregistered  Commonwealth v New South Wales     ACSR     Gyles J held that where land had been purchased by a company using grant moneys from a Commonwealth body that later was wound up and the liquidator disclaimed the land  it should be ordered pursuant to s  F of the Corporations Act    Cth  to vest in the Commonwealth  the State having submitted to any order the Court might make  Bryson J noted that under s  J where Crown land was brought under the provisions of the RP Act   the State s title was recorded as held for an estate in fee simple  Sandhurst   NSWLR at  F  And  he observed that only the interest of the owner of the fee simple went out of existence on an escheat under the RP Act so that the land reverted to the Crown subject to any mortgages or charges  Sandhurst   NSWLR at  E  Bryson J concluded that the Crown owned the fee simply as the consequence of an escheat on a disclaimer even if no recording reflecting these events had been made in the Register under s  H  He said   Sandhurst   NSWLR at  G  H       Proof of ownership has stepped outside or beyond the Torrens System  when the whole facts are seen they show that the person who  according to the register  is apparently the fee simple owner in truth is not  I think that the better view may be that by force of a disclaimer under the Bankruptcy Act  or Div  A of Pt     of the Corporations Act   the title to the fee simple or other property does not escheat absolutely to the Crown in right of the State because the Court can make an order vesting that title in someone else  The Court s power to make such a vesting order is created by a law of the Commonwealth  s   of the Bankruptcy Act or s  F  of the Corporations Act    By force of s   of the Constitution that law supplants any inconsistent automatic operation of a law of a State to the extent that some form of immediate and indefeasible escheat to the Crown in right of the State would otherwise have occurred  As I have observed  the ordinary incidents of an escheat are not readily seen as conformable with its suggested application to disclaimers  However  it is not necessary to express a final view  since this matter was not argued and I do not need to decide it  In the administration of bankrupt or insolvent estates  there is good reason for the Court to be cautious before uncritical acceptance of the application of the ancient doctrine of escheat  in light of its power to vest the disclaimed property in a person the Court considers  judicially  appropriate  An order divesting the Crown in right of the State of property that fell in to its radical title by escheat  may entitle the Crown to compensation on just terms for the loss of that title under s  xxxi  of the Constitution   where  for example  the Court concluded under s   of the Bankruptcy Act that any surplus after a mortgagee sale should be distributed to the bankrupt s unsecured creditors  The permanent deprivation of that asset from the estate merely because the trustee in bankruptcy disclaimed may work an unfairness to the unsecured creditors and give a windfall to the Crown in right of the State citedThe King v Attorney General of British Columbia   AC  In addition  given that now such disclaimers and vesting orders occur under laws of the Commonwealth  the question may arise as to whether any escheat or remaining interest in the property after a disclaimer should be treated as falling into the Crown in right of the Commonwealth rather than the State  cf Attorney General of Ontario   App Cas    And  in The King v Attorney General of British Columbia   AC   at     esp at   Lord Sumner observed that the principles upon which escheat and bona vacantia fall to the Crown are that where there is no private person entitled  the Crown takes  see too Land Law   th ed  where at pp     Professor Butt suggests that the only remnants in Australia of the doctrine of escheat are in the case of disclaimers by trustees in bankruptcy or liquidators  Because s   of the Bankruptcy Act preserves the possibility that the Court may vest disclaimed property in a person these doctrines may not operate in an unqualified way in the current legislative scheme  Once again  this is not the occasion to decide these questions  but they will require attention at some time  The title to the bankrupt s former landcitedWik Peoples v Queensland     CLR  The foundation of land tenure in Australian law was identified by Brennan J  with whom Mason CJ and McHugh J expressly agreed  in Mabo v Queensland  No     HCA         CLR   at     as being derived from the grant of tenure of some kind by the Crown  see too at   per Deane and Gaudron JJ  Brennan J said that one incident of such tenure was the Crown s right to escheat  Mabo   CLR at   see too at   per Deane and Gaudron JJ  And in Wik Peoples v Queensland     CLR   at     Brennan CJ explained that the doctrines of tenure  of which escheat is an incident  and of estate  ensure that no land in which the Crown has granted an interest is ever without a legal owner  Escheat was abolished in England by s  d  of Administration of Estates Act    Imp   What escheat involves at common law was elegantly explained by the Earl of Selborne LC giving the opinion of the Judicial Committee in Attorney General of Ontario v Mercer     App Cas   at    First  the Lord Chancellor quoted the following from Coke on Littleton  a         Escheat  is a word of art  and signifieth properly when by accident the lands fall to the lord of whom they are holden  in which case we say the fee is escheated        His Lordship then continued       The writ of escheat  when the tenant died without heirs  was in this form    The King to the Sheriff   c  Command A    c   that he render to B  ten acres of land  with the appurtenances  in N   which C  held of him  and which ought to revert to him  the said B   as his escheat  for that the said C  died without heirs   F  N  B     F    If there was a mesne lord  the escheat was to him  if not  to the King          From the use of the word  revert  in the writ of escheat  is manifestly derived the language of some authorities which speak of escheat as a species of  reversion   There cannot  in the usual and proper sense of the term  be a reversion expectant upon an estate in fee simple  What is meant is that  when there is no longer any tenant  the land returns  by reason of tenure  to the lord by whom  or by whose predecessors in title  the tenure was created  Other writers speak of the lord as taking it by way of succession or inheritance  as if from the tenant  which is certainly not accurate  The tenant s estate  subject to any charges upon it which he may have created  has come to an end  and the lord is in by his own right
