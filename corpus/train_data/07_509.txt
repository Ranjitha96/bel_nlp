 in effect  is given a free hit  and that seems to me to be intrinsically unfair discussedRe Alafaci  Registrar in Bankruptcy v Hardwick     ALR   The decision of the learned magistrate made on the application for summary judgment was based upon the  threshold requirement  as identified by Riley J in Re Alafaci  Registrar in Bankruptcy v Hardwick     ALR   at    It is that the Court should first be satisfied that on the grounds and facts before it a case had been made out for inquiry into the trustee s conduct under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   As his Honour said at   he needed to be satisfied before embarking upon an inquiry under s   that sufficient grounds had been demonstrated for the inquiry to be conducted  No ground of appeal attacks that analysis of the legal approach as incorrect   His Honour then addressed the evidence adduced by Mr Moore  together with that adduced by Mr Macks  and referred to the decisions of Lander J in the primary judgment  He noted the role of Mr Macks as a director and shareholder of Manna Hill Mining Co Pty Ltd  and also as its administrator and as its administrator under a Deed of Company Arrangement entered into apparently in May   and which Mr Moore maintained until he resigned as deed administrator in September    One of the other creditors of Manna Hill Mining Co Pty Ltd  as well as Mr Moore  was apparently Ms Dubois  Ms Dubois was also a bankrupt  and Mr Macks was also the trustee of her estate  His Honour considered Mr Moore s contentions as to the role of Mr Macks in the administration of that company in   and   and his role as trustee of the bankrupt estate of Ms Dubois  He concluded that there was nothing in that conduct which provided any sufficient basis to embark upon an inquiry under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth   His Honour also concluded that there were no communications between Mr Macks and Mr Moore which provided any basis for the Court to infer that Mr Macks had some significant animosity towards Mr Moore  Beyond that  as his Honour noted  the conflict of interest assertion had not been particularised  He described Mr Moore s contentions as being no more than inviting his Honour to speculate about Mr Macks  general attitude towards Mr Moore or about the reasons why Mr Macks should presently  as Mr Moore s trustee  have a conflict of interest  His Honour was not prepared simply to speculate about those matters in the absence of any material to support them   The next category of matters which were said to provide the basis for an inquiry concerned certain alleged conduct of Mr Macks through communications with Mr Moore  Although there were significant allegations of improper conduct on the part of Mr Macks  they were extremely general  His Honour concluded that there was no foundation for any of those allegations  His Honour rejected those allegations  He indicated that there was no material of any substance to establish any impropriety in the professional relationship between Mr Macks and his legal advisers  nor any foundation for the serious allegation Mr Moore had made against those legal advisers  They were rejected  unambiguously  as providing any basis for the Court to embark upon an inquiry under s   of the Bankruptcy Act    Cth    Dealing generally with the significant factual conclusions asserted by Mr Moore  his Honour said at     I accept the submission of the respondent that it is inappropriate to order an inquiry on the strength of allegations which have no factual basis and agree that to do otherwise would encourage disaffected bankrupts to make baseless allegations which would have the effect of requiring trustees to needlessly expend time and costs in defending their position   Nor was Mr Macks  decision to defer his decisions in relation to the conduct of the appeals from the primary judgment until his status as the trustee of Mr Moore was finally determined  by the judgment of   February   indicative of any conduct which would warrant such an inquiry  That part of the application was then referred to this Court and determined by Besanko J as referred to above   His Honour at   then referred to  the miscellany of other complaints raised by Mr Moore against Macks  and said that they all fall into the same category of  unsubstantiated assertion   In my view  there is nothing which has been identified by Mr Moore which shows that any of his assertions contained within the grounds of his appeal have any prospect of success  They are discursive  general and remain unsubstantiated by any cogent reference to evidence or reasoning  The same may be said of his submissions of   March     The application for summary dismissal of the proceeding before Lindsay FM was filed on   June   and ultimately argued on   December    Mr Moore had ample opportunity to prepare for it  His proposed evidence  even in its assertive form  was received and considered  Subsequent to that hearing  the learned magistrate received further evidence from Mr Moore on his application and had regard to it  There is nothing to indicate that Mr Moore was not given an opportunity to present to the Court such material as he was properly entitled to present  or was not given the opportunity to make submissions on the matters which he sought to make submissions upon  His allegations of not being accorded procedural fairness  or of the Magistrate having demonstrated a closed mind towards his application  are simply unfounded on the material before me   I take into account that the appeal in this matter has no apparent prospects of success   There has been a delay in bringing the application for security for costs in respect of this appeal  The notice of appeal was filed on   May    The notice of motion seeking security for costs was filed only on   February   following correspondence shortly before that time  However  I do not regard that delay as sufficiently significant in the present circumstances to affect the view which  on balance  I have otherwise reached in relation to the application  That is because  as noted above  the conduct of that appeal had been delayed whilst Besanko J heard that part of the proceeding which had been referred to this Court  The appeal is inter related with the matter before Besanko J which is now the subject of appeal SAD    As is apparent from the orders which have been made  it is appropriate that both appeals be heard together  There is nothing to suggest that Mr Moore s position has been adversely affected by the limited action in respect of his appeal up to the present time  and indeed he has not pressed for this appeal to have been listed for hearing earlier   In respect of the appeal from the judgment of Besanko J  SAD   of   the notice of appeal states the grounds assertively as follows         The legal principles governing the evidence and procedures were not properly applied                 Admissible evidence was excluded  The Judge acted unfairly and was biased             See attached document of further grounds of appeal number   to     I have read the subsequent paragraphs numbered   to    Apart from assertions without any identified basis  e g  the judge did not consider properly  Mr Moore complains of having insufficient time to present his evidence  The complaint seems to be that he could not adduce the  evidence concerning mining joint venture  my credibility  Lawton not being credible and Wilson not being credible witnesses   He also complains of Lawton and Wilson being represented and being allowed to appear at the hearing through counsel  He asserts that the appeals from the primary judgment were not part of his bankrupt estate  He asserts that the learned judge overlooked the existence of the appeals from the primary judgment  That is patently wrong  Nothing more need be said about it  He asserts that the learned judge should have found that Mr Macks had a relevant  but unspecified  conflict of interest which should have precluded him from taking any decision about the fate of the appeals from the primary judgment
