Swanline Pty Ltd v Ace Global Lloyds Syndicate     FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toSave the Ridge Inc v Commonwealth   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlIn Save the Ridge Inc v Commonwealth   FCAFC         FCR   Black CJ and Moore J said at        The formulation of separate or preliminary questions is authorised by O   r   of the Federal Court Rules    Cth   But it is a procedure that should be adopted with caution and can be fraught with difficulties  referred toMeat Industry Employees  Union and Another v G   K O Connor   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  htmlIn Australasian Meat Industry Employees  Union and Another v G   K O Connor   FCA         FCR     O Connor   the Full Court of this Court said at        It is sometimes useful to determine  by way of a preliminary question  an issue between parties that  if resolved in a particular way  may terminate the litigation  However  if this is to be done  it is essential the question be firmly grounded on specified facts  whether found by the court  agreed between the parties or alleged in a pleading  Without that  the answer to the question may not only be academic but can have the effect of confusing or misleading the parties  rather than enlightening them  The Full Court in O Connor then noted that in the case before it no facts were specified and it was inappropriate to determine the separate question determined at first instance appliedRainsford v Victoria and Another   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlFurther  in Rainsford v Victoria and Another   FCAFC         FCR     Rainsford   the Full Court of this Court said at        Whilst the use of the separate questions procedure can  in some circumstances  avoid delay and lessen the expense in resolving a proceeding  the cases show that there can also be significant difficulties in adopting the procedure   especially where no findings of fact have been made and the questions are capable of different interpretations  see Anderson v Wilson   FCA         FCR   at   per Black CJ and Sackville J  Importantly  in Rainsford   the Full Court said at        In order for a court exercising federal jurisdiction to utilise the separate questions procedure  either the parties must agree upon the relevant facts or the court must determine the facts before seeking to decide the question    Emphasis applied  In the current proceeding  Swanline and the respondents have not agreed on the relevant facts necessary to be found to determine the proposed separate questions  Further  Swanline has not placed before the Court in any affidavit the facts which it proposes the Court rely on to answer the proposed separate questions  Swanline submits that the respondents  defence clearly identifies the material facts relevant to the determination of each separate question  However  that is not the case  The relevant parts of the defence merely raise the issues which Swanline wishes to have the Court determine separately  It is no answer to say that the respondents carry the onus of proving the matters pleaded in their defence that bear on the separate questions  The Court is still in the position where the test referred to in Rainsford at   is not satisfied citedReading Pty Limited v Australian Mutual Provident Society and Another     ALR  In those circumstances  I am not satisfied that Swanline has discharged its onus of satisfying the Court that it is  just and convenient  for the trial to be split in the manner sought  see Reading Pty Limited v Australian Mutual Provident Society and Another     ALR   at      Apart from the difficulty caused by the absence of a factual foundation for the resolution to the proposed separate questions  there are other issues that will need to be addressed if Swanline succeeds on the separate questions  Any potential saving of time and cost may be minimal  In any event  if I am overcautious in refusing the motion for determination of the proposed separate questions  such caution is justified by the fact that the pleadings in the proceeding are not finalised  Swanline has foreshadowed further amendments to its statement of claim  Until the pleadings are complete  it is difficult to assess the true utility of seeking to split the trial  However  as things currently stand  in the absence of a firm factual foundation for the resolution of the proposed separate issues  I consider that Swanline s application pursuant to O   r   should be dismissed with costs    I certify that the preceding sixteen   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall    Associate Dated    October
