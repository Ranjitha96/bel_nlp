SZGGS v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toApplicant S  of   v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   August   the Minister s solicitor filed an application for summary dismissal which was made returnable on   September    However  the applicant on   August   filed a notice of discontinuance  Undeterred  on   September   he made an application to this court for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal against Einfeld J s decision  On   December   Bennett J dismissed that application saying that she was of the view that the applicant had no prospects of success in an appeal based on a new argument put forward  if it were a new argument  and had not demonstrated any special reasons for the exercise of a discretion to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal  Applicant S  of   v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA     appliedBienstein v Bienstein   HCA         ALR   at  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I do not have to form a final view about those matters because my function is to consider the application as an interlocutory application in which leave to appeal must be obtained  In Bienstein v Bienstein   HCA         ALR   at   it was said at paragraph      An applicant for leave must establish that the decision in question is attendant with sufficient doubt to warrant the grant of leave  He must also show that substantial injustice will result from refusal of leave to appeal   I am of the opinion that there is no sufficient doubt to warrant the grant of leave on the basis of the material in the application for leave to appeal or the applicant s affidavit of   December   the draft notice of appeal  or the matters referred to in the judgment below  For those reasons the application is dismissed   The Minister has applied for an order for costs fixed in the sum of    I note that in the court below  his Honour made an order that the applicant pay the costs on an indemnity basis  I am of the opinion that it is an appropriate case in which to make an order in the terms sought      I certify that the preceding seventeen   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares   Associate Dated    March   Applicant  In Person     Counsel for the Respondent  A Markus     Solicitor for the Respondent  Australian Government

htmlfollowedWalton v Gardiner   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  His Honour concluded that the substantive application had no merit at all  I am of opinion that that is an unimpeachably correct finding  In Walton v Gardiner   HCA         CLR   at     Mason CJ  Deane and Dawson JJ said     The inherent jurisdiction of a superior court to stay its proceedings on grounds of abuse of process extends to all those categories of cases in which the processes and procedures of the court  which exist to administer justice with fairness and impartiality  may be converted into instruments of injustice or unfairness  Thus  it has long been established that  regardless of the propriety of the purpose of the person responsible for their institution and maintenance  proceedings will constitute an abuse of process if they can be clearly seen to be foredoomed to fail  see e g  Metropolitan Bank v Pooley     App Cas   at pp     General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways   NSW    HCA         CLR   at pp      Again  proceedings within the jurisdiction of a court will be unjustifiably oppressive and vexatious of an objecting defendant  and will constitute an abuse of process  if that court is  in all the circumstances of the particular case  a clearly inappropriate forum to entertain them  see  generally  Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR    Yet again  proceedings before a court should be stayed as an abuse of process if  notwithstanding that the circumstances do not give rise to an estoppel  their continuance would be unjustifiably vexatious and oppressive for the reason that it is sought to litigate anew a case which has already been disposed of by earlier proceedings  see e g  Reichel v Magrath     App Cas   at p   Connelly v Director of Public Prosecutions   AC   at pp      The jurisdiction of a superior court in such a case was correctly described by Lord Diplock in Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police   AC   at p   as the  the inherent power which any court of justice must possess to prevent misuse of its procedure in a way which  although not inconsistent with the literal application of its procedural rules  would nevertheless be manifestly unfair to a party to litigation before it  or would otherwise bring the administration of justice into disrepute among right thinking people    The basis on which the applicant sought leave to appeal is set out in his affidavit sworn   December   and the draft notice of appeal of the same date  Before I embarked on the hearing of this matter I had the matter called outside the court  The applicant was given notice in a letter from the court dated   February   that the matter would be heard today  Mr Markus who appears for the Minister  informed me that he had received a copy of that letter in his office on   February  Mr Markus said no communication had been received from the applicant in relation to today s hearing and there is no record of the court of any such communication   The notice of appeal asserts that the trial Judge in the Federal Magistrates Court erred in holding that the delegate of the Minister had not given a biased decision based or that the original decision was not full of unreasonable and illogical applications in the delegate s mind followedWilson v Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Zubair v Minister   FCAFC         FCR   at           a Full Court of this Court held that any error affecting the decision of a delegate  including one which may go to jurisdiction  could not be relied on to challenge the subsequent decision on a merits review before the Tribunal  That is because the function of the Tribunal on review is to arrive at the correct and preferable decision  see Wilson v Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs   HCA         CLR   at    Secondly  by electing to challenge the adverse decision by way of merits review an applicant invites the reviewer to apply to him or her a fair procedure in arriving at that correct and preferable decision  Therefore  one ignores the alleged errors attending the making of the original decision  see too  Twist v Randwick Municipal Council   HCA         CLR   at   followedTwist v Randwick Municipal Council

dismissed
