Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The judgment of the Full Court in SZEEU does not support a narrow construction of s  A  It does not  in my view  throw

her husband indicated a wish to give evidence to the Tribunal  The Tribunal characterised the husband s evidence as  significantly discrepant  from the appellant s evidence on an important issue  Lee J at   said that  if the Tribunal relied on the alleged discrepancy as the reason or part of the reason  for its decision  it was bound to comply with s  A    Although the observations of Lee J in Applicant M  were obiter   I do not accept that his Honour made them per incuriam   His Honour set out in his reasons for judgment the terms of s  A in their entirety  Nor do I accept that Tamberlin J

 HCA         ALR   in WABY v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCA    Both Lee and Tamberlin JJ must be assumed to have read the reasons for judgment of Dowsett J who  in

purpose of the application consideredNBGM v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The appellant was represented at the hearing of his appeal by counsel appointed under O   of the Federal Court Rules   Judgment on the appeal has been delayed pending the publication of the Full Court judgments in SZEEU v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   and NBGM v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural   Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC    I now have supplementary written submissions from the parties concerning these judgments   The significance of Art  C  to a determination of entitlement to a protection visa was the subject of consideration by the Full Court in NBGM    For the appellant to be entitled to a protection visa it was necessary for the Tribunal to be satisfied  relevantly  that he is a person in respect of whom Australia has protection obligations under the Convention  s  a   Ordinarily  Australia will have protection obligations in respect of an individual who  owing to a well founded fear of persecution for reasons of race  religion  nationality  membership of a particular social group or political opinion  is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or  owing to such fear  is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country  Art  A of the Convention    Article  C  of the Convention has been described as a  cessation provision    It provides that the Convention shall cease to apply to any person falling under Art  A if that person can no longer  because the circumstances giving rise to his or her recognition as a refugee have ceased to exist  continue to refuse to avail himself or herself of the protection of the country of his or her nationality   The Tribunal  which made its decision before the publication of NBGM   concluded that Art  C  had no relevance to the appellant s application for a protection visa because he had not  as an individual  been recognised as a refugee when he came to Australia  The Tribunal considered s   of the Act to be determinative of the appellant s application  Section   provides     Australia is taken not to have protection obligations to a non citizen who has not taken all possible steps to avail himself or herself of a right to enter and reside in  whether temporarily or permanently and however that right arose or is expressed  any country apart from Australia  including countries of which the non citizen is a national   The appellant contended that the Tribunal erred both in concluding that he had not previously been recognised as a refugee and in treating s   of the Act as determinative of his application  The appellant submitted that the Tribunal ought to have proceeded on the basis that  because he was recognised as a refugee when he came to Australia  Australia owes protection obligations in respect of him unless those obligations have ceased because of Art  C  of the Convention  As I do not accept the Tribunal erred in treating s   as determinative of the appellant s application  it is not necessary for me to reach a concluded view on whether he was recognised as a refugee when he entered Australia   As mentioned above  the relevance of Art  C  to a determination of whether an individual is entitled to a protection visa has recently been considered by a Full Court in NBGM   The Full Court was constituted by five judges  The differing views expressed by the members of the Full Court complicate the identification of guiding principles   The appeal in NBGM was dismissed by a majority constituted by Black CJ and Mansfield and Stone JJ  Nonetheless  the appellant submits that I should follow the approach preferred by Allsop J  with whom Marshall J agreed  to the interaction of s   of the Act and Art  C  of the Convention  Assuming the appellant to have been recognised as a refugee when he came to Australia  on the approach preferred by Allsop J  Australia will have protection obligations with respect to him unless Art  C  applies to him   I conclude that to accept the above submission would be to disregard   of the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice in NBGM   Both Mansfield and Stone JJ expressed agreement with this paragraph  In   the Chief Justice noted that the majority of the Full Court agreed that  in considering an application for a protection visa  the decision maker must be satisfied that  at the time the decision is made  the appellant then has a well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason   The Tribunal was not satisfied that at the time of its decision the appellant had a well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason  It was therefore not open to the Tribunal to be satisfied that the appellant was entitled to a protection visa whatever the operation  if any  of Art  C  of the Convention in respect of the appellant   The appellant claimed to fear persecution in Vietnam because the Vietnamese authorities would impute to him the political opinions of his father who had been a member of the South Vietnamese army  The Tribunal did not accept that the political opinion of the appellant s father would lead to the appellant being persecuted in Vietnam  In its reasons for decision the Tribunal observed     The evidence shows that his father had only low ranking involvement in the Vietnam War  It shows that the state considered his debt discharged and atonement complete after six months in re education  The Applicant s father was allowed to return to the community and operate a small private business  however unrewarding  and was later allowed by the state to depart Vietnam  citedSAAP v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural

appellant s husband was evidence put before the Tribunal by the appellant and thus information that the appellant gave for the purpose of the application   As mentioned above  a reason  or a part of the reason  for the Tribunal s decision that the appellant is not entitled to a protection visa was that the applicant s father had been allowed by the Vietnamese authorities to return to the community and operate a small private business  The Tribunal  as I have found  did not comply with s  A in respect of this information  Its decision is thus invalid   SAAP     The appeal will be allowed and the orders of the Federal Magistrates Court will be set aside  In lieu thereof it will be ordered that the decision of the Tribunal be quashed and the appellant s application for a protection visa be remitted to the Tribunal to be determined according to law  The first respondent will be ordered to pay the appellant s costs thus giving his counsel an entitlement to recover fees
