merits of the appeal has  arguably  been downgraded in its ranking among the criteria to be taken into account by the court in exercising its discretion as to whether or not an extension of time should be granted  For example  in Culley v Australian Securities and Investments Commission   FCA   at     Jessup J observed    A party to a proceeding in the Tribunal has an appeal as of right on a

perhaps the more so because of the availability of s  A    I consider that the court should be slow to reject an application for an extension of time under s  A  of the AAT Act  where otherwise the

cases cth FCA  htmlThe Commissioner s opposition to the grant of an extension of time for the applicant to file a notice of appeal from the decision of the Tribunal was mainly  indeed wholly  grounded on the principle in   namely  the merits of the applicant s proposed appeal  In submissions  the Commissioner referred to the fact that in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Brown   FCA       ATC   at   a Full Court of this Court referred to that matter as an  important consideration  an applicant should show that he or she has an  arguable case  to warrant an extension of time  Brown   at first instance   FCA         ATC   at   per Hill J  accepting the view of von Doussa J in Windshuttle v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation   FCA         FCR   at   consideredHunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlAlthough the discretion to extend time to institute an appeal pursuant to O   r   of the Rules is not expressly confined by specified criteria  there is a range of factors of varying actual importance  which have been developed by the Court in analogous situations  Frequently relied on are the criteria referred to by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen   FCA         FCR   where his Honour was concerned with s   of the Administrative Decisions  Judicial Review  Act    Cth   the AD JR  Act  which  like O   r   does not set out any criteria by reference to which the court s discretion to extend time for an application for review under s   of the AD JR  Act is to be exercised  At   his Honour said    Already there have been a number of decisions of judges of this Court  all sitting at first instance  dealing with the approach proper to be taken  They differ a little  both in language and in emphasis  but I venture to suggest that from them may be distilled the following principles to guide  not in any exhaustive manner  the exercise of the court s discretion     His Honour then went on to deal with each of these principles  which  relevantly  may be paraphrased in the following way    Special circumstances need not be shown but the court will not grant the application unless positively satisfied that it is proper to do so  It is a pre condition to the exercise of discretion in his favour that the applicant for extension show an  acceptable explanation of the delay  and that it is  fair and equitable in the circumstances  to extend time     A distinction is to be made between the case of a person who  by non curial means  has continued to make the decision maker aware that he contests the finality of the decision and a case where the decision maker was allowed to believe the matter was finally concluded     Any prejudice to the respondent occasioned by the delay is a material factor militating against the grant of an extension     The mere absence of prejudice is not enough to justify the grant of an extension     The merits of the substantial application are properly to be taken into account in considering whether an extension of time should be granted  More recently  however  the importance to be attached to the merits of the appeal has  arguably  been downgraded in its ranking among the criteria to be taken into account by the court in exercising its discretion as to whether or not an extension of time should be granted  For example  in Culley v Australian Securities and Investments Commission   FCA   at     Jessup J observed    A party to a proceeding in the Tribunal has an appeal as of right on a question of law

apparent that I do not consider that an application for an extension of time is an occasion for any more than the most cursory examination of the merits of the proposed proceeding  nonetheless I recognise that  if such an examination does reveal the proceeding as being conspicuously devoid of merit  the application might well be rejected upon the ground that the prosecution of it would  in effect  be pointless     In relation to this last observation  see Tey v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA   at     per Gilmour J  Having regard to the following facts and circumstances  namely    That Mr Hua  an unqualified person  appeared on behalf of the applicant at the hearing before the Tribunal    the evidence embodied in Ex    none of which was challenged  and    the evidence embodied in Ex    none of which was challenged   I am satisfied that the only relevant consideration  a conclusion on which might militate against an exercise of discretion to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal  is whether the grounds of appeal as articulated in the amended draft notice of appeal disclose an arguable case  even if it is unlikely to succeed  or whether they are so devoid of merit as to render prosecution of the appeal pointless  Before turning to that issue  it is necessary that I deal with the various bases upon which the Commissioner assailed the amended draft notice of appeal  The Commissioner assailed the grounds relied on in the amended draft notice of appeal on an holistic basis claiming that they did not comply with O   r  d  of the Rules which expressly provides that a notice of appeal must state  briefly  but specifically  the grounds relied upon in support of the order sought  citedTNT Skypak International  Aust   Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   FCA
