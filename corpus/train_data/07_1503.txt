this view  his Honour pointed at   to authoritative statements of principle by the High Court in Perre v Apand Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   and Agar v Hyde   HCA         CLR   in which emphasis was placed  in the development of the law of negligence  on the acceptance by individuals of personal responsibility for their own actions   The following paragraphs of the conclusion of Spigelman CJ are instructive and I will set them out in full      The discussion of vulnerability in    Perre v Apand Pty Ltd    and the authorities cited therein  place considerable emphasis on the practical inability of the injured party to take steps to protect him or her or itself  whether because of ignorance of the risk or otherwise  There was no such practical inability in the present case        It may well be that the appellant found it difficult  even impossible  to control his urge to continue gambling beyond the point of prudence  However  there was nothing which prevented him staying away from the club  The suggested duty on the club to advise him to resign his membership emphasises the point  He could have resigned at any time  The requests to refuse to cash cheques when asked  did not shift his personal responsibility for his own actions to the club  There was no reason for the club to honour one request rather than the other        In my opinion this combination of circumstances is such that no duty of care was owed of the character for which the appellant contended  The risks were obvious  As Gleeson CJ said with respect to the analogous situation of a participant in sport   The only way to avoid risk of injury is not to play    Agar v Hyde at       The Appellant must accept responsibility for his own actions  There was no duty of care  There was no unconscionable conduct  The appeal should be dismissed with costs  distinguishedAmerican Express International v Famularo  unreported  District Court of NSW  Norton DCJ    February   The present case bears no resemblance to the factual findings made by Judge Naughton in American Express International v Famularo  unreported  District Court of NSW  Norton DCJ    February    In any event  Powell JA doubted the correctness of that decision in Reynolds v Katoomba RSL at   distinguishedCommercial Bank of Australia Ltd v Amadio and Anor   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The claim of unconscionable conduct under ss  AA and or  AB of the Trade Practices Act was not properly pleaded  However  senior counsel for Mr Foroughi conceded that the claim was based on the same matters as are the subject of the claim for misleading conduct  Reference was made in Mr Foroughi s written submissions to well known authorities including Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd v Amadio and Anor   HCA         CLR     I do not consider that Mr Foroughi was under any special disability  Nor do I consider that Star City took advantage of him within the well known statements of principle in Amadio   The findings I have made about the circumstances in which the exclusion order was made are quite inconsistent with any suggestion of unconscionable conduct discussedConcrete Constructions  NSW  Pty Limited v Nelson   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The High Court observed in Concrete Constructions  NSW  Pty Limited v Nelson   HCA         CLR   at     that s   was not intended to extend to all conduct in which a corporation may engage in the course of  or for the purposes of  its trading or commercial business   Section   of the Trade Practices Act is concerned with the conduct of a corporation towards persons with whom the corporation has or may have dealings  in the course of those activities which bear a trading or commercial character  see Concrete Constructions at     It is true  as the High Court said  that the dividing line may not always be clear and may require identification of what imports the requisite trading or commercial character to the impugned conduct  In the present case  the point was not fully argued and accordingly I do not propose to express a concluded view on this question   The claim for breach of statutory duty under s   of the Casino Control Act was not argued at the hearing  In any event  the legislative history and the case law indicate that the intention of the Casino Control Act was not to confer a private right of action for damages on problem gamblers who may enter a casino in breach of an exclusion order   The enactment of the Casino Control Act was preceded by an inquiry into the Establishment and Operation of Legal Casinos in New South Wales conducted by Sir Lawrence Street  Sir Lawrence s recommendations were adopted when the Casino Control Bill was introduced by the Minister  see Second Reading Speech    March   Legislative Assembly  pp     and     Sir Lawrence said in plain terms that the provisions dealing with exclusion orders should not include a requirement that a casino be required by law to exclude persons whose gambling appeared to be out of control  He considered that this may be seen as creating a statutory duty with a correlative right of action upon the gambler to sue the casino for damages  which he rejected  These comments applied in equal terms to voluntary and non voluntary exclusion orders  see the report of the Hon  Sir Lawrence Street AC KCMG   Inquiry into the Establishment and Operation of Legal Casinos in New South Wales    November   at       to        the Street Report  appliedEllis v Wallsend District Hospital     NSWLR   I am not bound to accept Mr Foroughi s evidence of what took place on   December   even though it was unchallenged in cross examination  Ellis v Wallsend District Hospital     NSWLR   at      I reiterate what I have said about Mr Foroughi s credit  But even on his version of what took place on that day  the evidence does not establish that Star City knew that Mr Foroughi was gambling in the casino in breach of the terms of his voluntary exclusion order  Thus  s   would not have been engaged   Mr Foroughi called evidence from Mr Ross Colquhoun  a clinical psychologist  to support his case  Mr Colquhoun saw Mr Foroughi on   and   November   and  with the assistance of a colleague  took a history and administered a series of psychological tests   Mr Colquhoun concluded that Mr Foroughi met the diagnostic criteria for pathological gambling stipulated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders   th ed text revision  American Psychiatric Association Washington     DSM IV  appliedPerre v Apand Pty Limited   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In support of this view  his Honour pointed at   to authoritative statements of principle by the High Court in Perre v Apand Pty Limited   HCA         CLR   and Agar v Hyde   HCA         CLR   in which emphasis was placed  in the development of the law of negligence  on the acceptance by individuals of personal responsibility for their own actions appliedPreston v Star City Pty Ltd   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  Moreover  in Preston v Star City Pty Ltd   NSWSC   at     Wood CJ in Common Law referred to the Street Report to support the view that the requisite legislative intention to confer a private right of action was not to be found in the Casino Control Act    Preston was not concerned with a breach of s   of the Casino Control Act   which was pleaded in the present case  Nevertheless  his Honour s remarks at   were directed at the establishment of the regulatory scheme as a whole  He said that the Street Report and the Second Reading Speech point towards  the establishment of the regulatory scheme as the means of addressing the negative aspects of legalised gambling   He continued by saying     There is nothing in that material  or in the Act itself  to suggest that there should be a private right of action additional to the obligations imposed upon casino operators  distinguishedPreston v Star City Pty Limited  No     NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  More recent authority does not assist Mr Foroughi s claim  In Preston v Star City Pty Limited  No     NSWSC     Hoeben J permitted a claim in negligence to proceed to trial because the allegations went beyond those made in Reynolds v Katoomba RSL  The claim was that Star City knew of the plaintiff s problem and actively encouraged and exploited it  No such claim is made in the present proceedings appliedReynolds v Katoomba RSL All Services Club Ltd   NSWCA         NSWLR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  On all occasions on which Mr Foroughi entered the gaming areas of Star City after   May   he did so in knowing breach of the terms of his voluntary exclusion order  His claims for damages are contrary to the principle of individual autonomy which underlies the common law s view as to the limits of legal responsibility for pure economic loss  see for example Reynolds v Katoomba RSL All Services Club Ltd   NSWCA         NSWLR   at       Nevertheless  Mr Foroughi asserts that Star City owed him a duty of care  the content of which is not entirely clear  but which appears to have been to take reasonable steps to prevent him from entering the gaming areas of the casino and or to remove him from the casino  Mr Foroughi also contends that express misleading representations  said to be in trade or commerce  were made to him by an employee of Star City when he was being escorted from the casino after the voluntary exclusion order was made   The representations for which Mr Foroughi sues for damages under ss   and   of the Trade Practices Act    Cth  as amplified in his oral evidence  are said to have been to the effect that        Star City had   surveillance cameras in the casino which would be able to detect Mr Foroughi if he entered the gaming areas  and    as soon as practicable after it became known to Star City that Mr Foroughi was in the casino  Star City would remove him from the premises   The question of whether a registered club owed a duty of care to a member who it knew  or ought to have known  to be a problem gambler  to protect the person against financial loss from gambling was considered by the NSW Court of Appeal in Reynolds v Katoomba RSL  The Court  Spigelman CJ  Powell and Giles JJA  was unanimous in holding that no such duty was owed   Chief Justice Spigelman observed that  save in an extraordinary case  an example of which he was unable to conceive  economic loss occasioned by gambling should not be accepted to be a form of loss for which the law permits recovery   The following paragraphs of the conclusion of Spigelman CJ are instructive and I will set them out in full      The discussion of vulnerability in    Perre v Apand Pty Ltd    and the authorities cited therein  place considerable emphasis on the practical inability of the injured party to take steps to protect him or her or itself  whether because of ignorance of the risk or otherwise  There was no such practical inability in the present case        It may well be that the appellant found it difficult  even impossible  to control his urge to continue gambling beyond the point of prudence  However  there was nothing which prevented him staying away from the club  The suggested duty on the club to advise him to resign his membership emphasises the point  He could have resigned at any time  The requests to refuse to cash cheques when asked  did not shift his personal responsibility for his own actions to the club  There was no reason for the club to honour one request rather than the other        In my opinion this combination of circumstances is such that no duty of care was owed of the character for which the appellant contended  The risks were obvious  As Gleeson CJ said with respect to the analogous situation of a participant in sport   The only way to avoid risk of injury is not to play    Agar v Hyde at       The Appellant must accept responsibility for his own actions  There was no duty of care  There was no unconscionable conduct  The appeal should be dismissed with costs   In Reynolds v Katoomba RSL   the Court refused to recognise a duty of care notwithstanding the trial judge s finding that the club knew that the plaintiff and his father had asked the club to prevent him from gambling to excess  in particular by refusing to cash cheques  see at       and     In my view the present claim is indistinguishable from the decision of the Court of Appeal in Reynolds v Katoomba RSL which I respectfully follow  While it is true that the question of whether a duty of care exists must depend on all the circumstances of the case  the claimed duty in the present proceedings is on an even weaker foundation than that which was relied upon by the plaintiff in Reynolds v Katoomba RSL    Here  Mr Foroughi expressly and voluntarily undertook responsibility for his own conduct in agreeing not to enter the gaming areas of Star City and to seek assistance and guidance of a qualified and recognised counsellor   More recent authority does not assist Mr Foroughi s claim  In Preston v Star City Pty Limited  No     NSWSC     Hoeben J permitted a claim in negligence to proceed to trial because the allegations went beyond those made in Reynolds v Katoomba RSL  The claim was that Star City knew of the plaintiff s problem and actively encouraged and exploited it  No such claim is made in the present proceedings   The present case bears no resemblance to the factual findings made by Judge Naughton in American Express International v Famularo  unreported  District Court of NSW  Norton DCJ    February    In any event  Powell JA doubted the correctness of that decision in Reynolds v Katoomba RSL at   discussedRixon v Star City Pty Ltd   NSWCA  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw NSWCA  html  Even if a private right of action exists against Star City  no such cause of action was established in the present case  In Rixon v Star City Pty Ltd   NSWCA     Sheller JA  with whom Priestley and Heydon JJA agreed  said that s   of the Casino Control Act combines two prerequisites of knowledge on the part of the casino operator  or other person to whom the section applies   These requirements are  first  knowledge that a particular person is in the casino  and  second  knowledge that the person is the subject of an exclusion order  see Rixon at     Here  with the exception of the two occasions on which Mr Foroughi was detected in the casino in early   the evidence disclosed only one occasion on which Mr Foroughi was present in the casino to the knowledge of Star City  after the exclusion order was made  That was on   December   when he said he was offered admission to the high rollers  facilities   Mr Foroughi was not challenged on that evidence  although the reliability of his evidence as to the actual dates of entry stated in Mr Foroughi s schedule were put directly in issue by Star City
