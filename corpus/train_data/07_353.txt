New South Wales Department of Housing v Moskalev   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedFencott and Others v Muller and Another   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Gibbs J made similar observations in Fencott and Others v Muller and Another   HCA         CLR   at      It is now established by Philip Morris v  Brown that once a federal court is invested with jurisdiction with respect to a matter  it may determine all the questions which form part of that matter  even though they are questions which it would have no jurisdiction to entertain if they arose in separate proceedings    At   his Honour continued     The question whether one claim is inseverable from another  so that both are part of one matter  is a question of fact and degree  The Constitution   however  makes it clear that the attached claim must be part of the matter that attracts jurisdiction  closeness of association is not enough   Two observations may be made  First  the facts and evidence relating to the claim of the Moskalevs  alleging discrimination are different to those relating to the administrative review of the Department s decision pursuant to its Priority Housing Policy and are not  inseverable   see  Gibbs J in Fencott v Muller   CLR    The Court accepts the submission of the Department that there was no requirement for it to adduce evidence of its procedures relating to the operation of the Housing Appeals Committee in view of the only matter before Driver FM  namely the claim of discrimination  The order requires the Department to undertake a merits review of its determination in relation to the Moskalevs  application for priority housing when such question did not arise either as a federal or as an associated matter   Second  the request of the Moskalevs  to be placed on the priority housing list did not constitute a separate  matter  for the exercise of the Court s jurisdiction  The claim for such order was ancillary to the claim of discrimination under the HREOC Act  Accordingly s   of the FMA cannot be used as a source of jurisdiction to justify the order   The order could have been justified under s  PO  of the HREOC Act had a finding of unlawful discrimination been made  In the absence of any finding of unlawful conduct by the Department there was no jurisdiction under s   of the FMA which could support the order and the request to be placed on the priority housing list does not constitute an  associated matter  under s   of the FMA  It follows that the order was made ultra vires citedIn Re the Judiciary Act     and In Re The Navigation Act       HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Section   of the FMA provides a source of jurisdiction in associated  matters

argument that the word  matter  in s   of the Constitution referred only to a legal proceeding  said     We do not accept this contention  we do not think that the word   matter  in sec    means a

Hospital Products International Proprietary Limited and Others   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Philip Morris Incorporated and Another v Adam P Brown Male Fashions Proprietary Limited  United States Surgical Corporation v Hospital Products International Proprietary Limited and Others   HCA         CLR   at   Barwick CJ said of the application of s   of the Federal Court Act     Thus  there may be circumstances in which the matter does not in substance itself attract federal jurisdiction  though that which attracts federal jurisdiction must in some way relate to the matter  Once federal jurisdiction is attracted  it is not lost because the claim or assertion which attracted it has not been substantiated or has been displaced by some countervailing fact  Once attracted  by whatever path attracted  the jurisdiction persists to enable the Court to resolve the matter    Since s   of the FMA is in virtually identical terms to s   of the Federal Court Act  his Honour s observations are pertinent to the associated jurisdiction of the FMC   There are however  limits to the type of matter which can properly be described as  associated  with the jurisdiction of a federal court  Barwick CJ expressed the following caution at      But the jurisdiction will not extend to any other matter  though that other matter might in some sense be an allied or associated matter  To be outside the accrued jurisdiction  however  the other matter must be separate and disparate from the matter in relation to or in connexion with which federal jurisdiction has been attracted   Gibbs J  as he then was  said of the extent of the jurisdiction of the Court to deal with matters  other than federal claims at      The cases to which I have referred show that if a party claims relief on two different legal grounds  but the facts on which the relief is sought on each ground are identical  and the relief sought on each ground is the same in substance if not in form  there is only one matter for determination  referred toRana v Fergusson   Ors  No     FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  Section   of the FMA is in effect the same as s

Others  Ex parte Amann and Another  Spinks and Others v Prentice   HCA         CLR   at   Gummow and Hayne JJ said of the associated jurisdiction     So  too  there is but one matter where different claims are so related that the determination of one is essential to the determination of the other   as  for example  in the case of third party proceedings or where there are alternative claims for the same damage and the determination of one will either render the other otiose or necessitate its determination  Conversely  claims which are  completely disparate     completely separate and distinct    or  distinct and unrelated    are not part of the same matter    These authorities confirm that to enliven the associated jurisdiction of a court invested with federal jurisdiction  the facts must be common to each matter and the relief sought must be substantially the same   Section   of the FMA provides a source of jurisdiction in associated  matters   A  matter  must be a

austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  Despite Driver FM making no finding of direct or indirect discrimination by the Department against Mr Moskalev under the DDA  his Honour considered that the Department had given inadequate consideration to the cumulative medical evidence provided to the Commission  With regard to the request by Mr Moskalev for a three or four bedroom free standing house  his Honour noted at   of his judgment that the Department     ought to have accepted that there was sufficient evidence of a medical need for detached accommodation to justify restricting the assessment of available private accommodation to that class of dwelling      His Honour stated at      While the claim of indirect or direct discrimination fails the Department should  in my view  reassess Mr Moskalev s entitlement to priority housing on the basis that the available medical evidence points to a medical need for fully detached accommodation    Mr Jungwirth  in argument  indicated that the Department would not find such a direction objectionable  As I noted in Tyler v Kesser Torah College   FMCA     at   s  PO  of the HREOC Act is not an exhaustive statement of the orders that may be made by the Court in proceedings under the Act  In my view  even where unlawful discrimination is not established  the Court may  in appropriate circumstances  as here  use s   of the Federal Magistrates Act    Cth  to correct administrative error   It should be observed that the Department  through its counsel  disavowed the statement that it   would not find such a direction objectionable    However  based upon such understanding  his Honour made the following orders      The respondent shall reassess the applicants  eligibility for priority housing under the respondent s priority housing policy upon the basis that Mr Illya Moskalev has demonstrated a medical need for free standing accommodation with a backyard      The application is otherwise dismissed   The Department challenges the validity of Order    the order  on the ground that Driver FM had no power to make it in the absence of a finding of unlawful discrimination under the DDA  The Department submits that the order of Driver FM in effect required the Department to review the exercise of its statutory functions under the Housing Act    NSW   the Housing Act   and as such the reasoning of Driver FM constituted an impermissible merits review of the Department s determination of the Moskalevs  application for priority housing   The Department also submits that in the absence of a finding of unlawful discrimination no occasion arose for Driver FM to consider any question of judicial review of the Department s administrative actions  It submits that Driver FM erroneously substituted his own opinion by finding at   of his decision     The Department should have followed the  Department s Housing Appeals  Committee s advice and accepted that a medical need for free standing accommodation had been established    The Department is a statutory corporation established under the Housing Act   Its affairs are conducted by the Director General of the New South Wales Land and Housing Corporation  see  s   of the Housing Act   who has responsibility for maintaining and overseeing the operations of the Corporation in the name of the Department  see s   of the Housing Act    The objects of the Housing Act are to ensure the provision of social housing to persons with demonstrable need for such assistance in New South Wales  The Housing Appeals Committee is an internal committee of the Department established as a second level avenue of appeal  The Department acknowledges that it is bound to observe both State and Commonwealth anti discrimination legislation in relation to the provision of housing   Driver FM  referring to his decision in Tyler v Kesser Torah College   FMCA   considered that even if unlawful discrimination has not been established s   of the FMA could be used to correct administrative error  Due to the ancillary nature of orders that may be made under s   of the FMA  such observation is valid provided that the Court in making the order is exercising a source of federal jurisdiction   Driver FM had before him a claim alleging discrimination under the HREOC Act  Such claim  if upheld could give rise to relief of a kind proposed by the order  However section  PO  of the HREOC Act does not provide any power to make declarations or orders against a party where there has been no finding of unlawful discrimination  The Court can only make orders   if the court concerned is satisfied that there has been unlawful discrimination    see s  PO   Accordingly if the claim by the Moskalevs to be appointed to the priority housing list was ancillary only to their claim under the HREOC Act  there was no jurisdiction to make the order following the finding that there was no unlawful discrimination  Since there was no jurisdiction under s  PO  of the HREOC Act  an alternate source of federal jurisdiction other than s   of the FMA is necessary to support the order  It is therefore necessary to consider whether the power to make the order lies in any associated jurisdiction of the Court  since the order could only be justified if a separate and different cause of action had been raised which the Court could deal with pursuant to s   of the FMA
