Strandbags Group is  unambiguously the proprietor of the Colorado mark in respect of handbags because of first use  There was a contest about its first use in relation to wallets and purses  Even if that contest had been resolved differently it would not have affected the outcome  In my earlier judgment I explained that a person is entitled to registration of a mark not only in respect of goods to which the mark has been applied but also to goods or classes of goods that are  of the same kind  Jackson   Co v Napper     Ch D    This is because it is assumed that a consumer is likely to believe that the other goods originate from the same source as the goods in respect of which the mark has been used   In my view purses and wallets are goods of the same kind as handbags  Both are intended as fashion items and are used to carry small  everyday items such as money  credit cards  keys and like objects  True  handbags are usually larger than both wallets and purses but I do not think this affects the kind of goods they are  At any rate  it is often very difficult to tell the difference between what is a purse and what is a handbag these days  with many handbags being quite small in size  A consumer would expect a handbag and a purse or wallet bearing the same mark to come from the same source  Some are even matching in design  Indeed  many leading fashion houses sell lines of handbags  purses and wallets   Were it necessary this analysis would produce the following consequence  That is  Strandbags Group would not infringe Colorado Group s mark when it applied the mark to wallets or purses  as well as handbags citedJellinek s Application for a Trade Mark  Re     RPC   I can dispose of the  same description  inquiry fairly swiftly  Whether goods are  of the same
