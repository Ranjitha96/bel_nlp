Ex Christmas Islanders Association Inc v The Attorney General for the Commonwealth   FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedEx Christmas Islanders Association Inc v Attorney General   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In the reasons for judgment delivered on   December   I said Ex Christmas Islanders Association Inc v Attorney General   FCA    at        The application not only lacked merit but it appeared  in preparation  to have fallen short of the minimum standards of professional competence that should be expected in an application in this Court where the applicant is represented by a legal practitioner  The submissions also disclose a failure to give adequate consideration to key legal issues such as the non statutory character of the Scheme      I made an order that       The solicitors for the applicants are to show cause by written submissions filed on or before   February   why they should not pay the respondent s costs of the application      The respondent was to file written submissions on the question of costs by   March    Written submissions were filed with the Court by the applicants  solicitors and on behalf of the respondents   Section   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  provides  inter alia        Subject to subsection  A  the Court or a Judge has jurisdiction to award costs in all proceedings before the Court  including proceedings dismissed for want of jurisdiction  other than proceedings in respect of which any other Act provides that costs shall not be awarded                Except as provided by any other Act  the award of costs is in the discretion of the Court or Judge   Order   r   of the Federal Court Rules provides        Without limiting the Court s discretion to award costs in a proceeding  if costs are incurred improperly or without reasonable cause  or are wasted by undue delay or by any other misconduct or default  and it appears to the Court that a legal practitioner is responsible  whether personally or through a servant or agent  the Court may  after giving the legal practitioner a reasonable opportunity to be heard  do any of the following           a  disallow the costs as between the legal practitioner and the legal practitioner s client     b  if the legal practitioner is a barrister disallow the costs as between the barrister and the barrister s instructing solicitor     c  direct the legal practitioner to repay to the client  costs which the client has been ordered to pay to another party     d  direct the legal practitioner to indemnify any party other than the client against costs payable by the party indemnified                    Before making an order under subrule   the Court may refer the matter to a Registrar for inquiry and report        The Court may order that notice of any proceeding or order against a legal practitioner be given  as specified in the order  to       a  the legal practitioner s clients  or        b  if the legal practitioner is a barrister the barrister s instructing solicitor            For the purpose of giving effect to a costs order  the Court may give ancillary directions  including a direction to a legal practitioner to provide to the Court or a party to the proceeding a bill of costs in assessable form  citedKnight v FP Special Assets Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases

Scott   FCA     Bennett J agreed with the explanation of the authorities by Mansfield J in Kumar   Her Honour was not satisfied that the solicitor in Bagshaw had deliberately or consciously decided to commence proceedings without any recognition of the absence of a prospect of success  His conduct was not so unreasonable that it attracted an order that he pay costs personally  Her Honour set out a number of propositions emerging from the authorities  McColl JA undertook a similar exercise in Lemoto  It is not necessary to quote or analyse those lists here save to acknowledge them as convenient  albeit not entirely congruent  references to the law as stated in English and Australian cases   It is necessary to bear in mind the particular statutory context in which the decisions of different courts are made in awarding costs against practitioners personally  In England  for example  prior to   superior courts had an inherent disciplinary jurisdiction to make orders for the payment of costs by solicitors personally Myers v Elman at    Viscount Maughan   That power was widened and extended to both solicitors and barristers by the enactment  in   of a new s   of the Supreme Court Act    UK  providing for what are called  wasted costs  orders  Some of the case law in this area is based upon rules of court predating that change which are similar in terms to O   r    Like rules are to be found in the State Supreme Courts see the detailed discussion by McColl JA in Lemoto at       In Lemoto McColl JA referred  at   to an apparent tension between decisions of the Federal Court and those of State appellate courts in circumstances in which legal practitioners act for litigants with hopeless cases  The Full Court in Levick had approved Goldberg J s conclusion in White Industries that a solicitor does not act improperly by acting for a party with a hopeless case unless that conduct is  unreasonable   On the other hand  in Carson v Legal Services Commission   NSWCA   at     Sheller JA  Giles JA agreeing  apparently excluded from the scope of proper conduct proceedings which are  futile or fore doomed to fail   And in Steindl  at   Williams JA set apart the case      which is plainly unarguable and ought to be so to the lawyer who presents it   Her Honour found it unnecessary to resolve those tensions in the case before the Court of Appeal in Lemoto   Nor is it necessary here to resolve those tensions  However  what Weinberg J said in Tran appears to involve the proposition that the wider range of cases is open to the application of O   r   citedMyers v

J    In Kumar v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA         FCR   Mansfield J rejected an application for costs made by the Minister against the solicitor for the applicant  His Honour held that  simply by instituting or maintaining on instructions  proceedings with no real prospect of success a solicitor would not be exposed to an order for costs  He referred to Medcalf v Mardell at      Lord Hobhouse  and the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal in Steindl Nominees Pty Ltd v Laghaifar     Qd R   at    Davies JA   In the latter case Davies JA  with whom Williams JA and Philippides J agreed  said that       If the case is plainly unarguable it is improper to argue it      Nevertheless Mansfield J found  in the concurring judgment of Williams JA  a qualification in his reference to what Lord Hobhouse said in Medcalf v Mardell  at              So it is not enough that the court considers that the advocate has been arguing a hopeless case  The litigant is entitled to be heard  to penalise the advocate for presenting his client s case to the court would be contrary to the constitutional principles to which I have referred  The position is different if the court concludes that there has been improper time wasting by the advocate or the advocate has knowingly lent himself to an abuse of process  citedHarley v McDonald   UKPC         AC

difficult for a court to know all the details and circumstances of a solicitor s instructions  but then said  at            it is equally important to uphold the right of a court to order a solicitor to pay costs wasted by the solicitor s unreasonable conduct of a case  What constitutes unreasonable conduct must depend upon the circumstances of the case  no comprehensive definition is possible  In the context of instituting or maintaining a proceeding or defence  we agree with Goldberg J that unreasonable conduct must be more than acting on behalf of a client who has little or no prospect of success  There must be something akin to abuse of process  that is  using the proceeding for an ulterior purpose or without any  or any proper  consideration of the prospects of success    emphasis added   It is the last mentioned conduct which is relevant here where the question is whether the practitioner has proceeded without any  or any proper  consideration of the prospects of success  That

 The question whether costs have been unreasonably incurred because of the manner in which a legal practitioner has conducted a case should not require consideration of whether this was done for an ulterior purpose  If a client instructs a legal representative to take points that are manifestly without merit  the legal representative has a duty to the Court to refuse to act on those instructions  In that regard  there is a distinction between points that are barely arguable  but most likely to fail which can and sometime must be taken  and points that are simply unarguable  If a point is plainly unarguable  it is improper to argue it  If a client insists upon it being argued  the legal representative should decline to do so and  if necessary  withdraw from the proceeding   In Lemoto

solicitor instructions to institute the application  There was no evidence about what information had been given to the solicitor for the applicant or what advice the solicitor gave the applicant  His

in Harley v McDonald   NZLR   on appeal from the Court of Appeal of New Zealand  held that the High Court of New Zealand had power to make costs orders against barristers and solicitors  In that country  as in Western Australia  there is a fused profession in which persons are admitted to practice as both barristers and solicitors  All have the same rights of audience in the courts  Lord Hope  delivering the judgment of their Lordships  said  at          it is hard to find a sufficiently clear dividing line between the style of practice of barristers on the one hand and that of solicitors on the other to justify giving an immunity from costs orders to barristers which is not enjoyed by solicitors  Recognition that barristers are subject to the same jurisdiction in this respect as solicitors is not inconsistent with any statutory provision or any rule of practice  In both cases there is the same public interest that a serious dereliction of duty to the Court by one of its officers should be dealt with by the Court  Their Lordships agree with the Court of Appeal that it is desirable in the public interest that the High Court should have power in appropriate cases to award costs against a barrister personally      The distinction between solicitor and barrister appears to have no relevance in terms of principle in the exercise of the Court s powers to award costs against practitioners personally under s   or under O   r    Their distinctive roles may give rise to different applications of the general principles informing the exercise of the Court s powers citedRidehalgh v Horsefield   Ch   The Privy Council accepted the Court of Appeal s conclusion  at             that a duty rests on officers of the Court to achieve and maintain appropriate levels of competence and care and that  if he is in serious dereliction of such duty  the officer is properly amenable to the costs jurisdiction of the Court      Their Lordships cautioned  however  that care must be taken not to assume that just because it appears to the court that the case was hopeless there was a failure by the barrister or solicitor to achieve the appropriate level of competence and care  In this respect the same distinction was drawn  as in the Australian cases  between the practitioner who represents a client in a weak or hopeless case after having advised the client of its weakness or hopelessness on the one hand and the practitioner who lends assistance to proceedings which are an abuse of process of the court  Their Lordships cited the Master of the Rolls in Ridehalgh v Horsefield   Ch    at        It not entirely easy to distinguish by definition between the hopeless case and the case which amounts to an abuse of the process  but in practice it is not hard to say which is which and if there is doubt the legal representative is entitled to the benefit of it      The Privy Council added  at        The essential point is that it is not errors of judgment that attract the exercise of the jurisdiction  but errors of a duty owed to the Court   The legal practitioner  who acted as both counsel and solicitor for the applicants in this case  described his clients in an affidavit sworn on   August    He referred to them as  elderly  disabled non English speaking  unskilled labourers or unemployed persons   In his written submission filed on   August   and signed by him  he said  at        The applicants are disadvantaged asian  sic  Islanders of non English speaking background without any education or training who were resettled to mainland Australia from Christmas Island at the direction and authority of the Commonwealth  They ought not have to be subjected to further unconscionability and inequity by the respondent      There is no basis for any suggestion that the shortcomings of the application and the way in which the proceedings were conducted has anything to do with the applicants themselves  The circumstances of this case make it highly improbable that the practitioner advised his clients of the hopelessness of the application and that he was instructed to proceed with it notwithstanding   The application for judicial review did not  as required by the Federal Court Rules   set out the grounds of the order for review it sought  It sought no extension of time for claims which were plainly out of time  It disclosed a conceptual confusion between the identification of the conduct and decisions complained of and the grounds of judicial review themselves  The formulation of the claim for relief by way of mandamus in the amended application was thus           a writ of mandamus directing               An order of review in respect of the decision of the respondent     The ADJR Act applies to decisions of an administrative character made  under an enactment   The relevant enactment was not able to be identified by the practitioner and as it turned out there was none  The legal assistance scheme was administered pursuant to an appropriation made under Appropriations Acts  In the event no relief was available under the ADJR Act as there was no enactment under which  it could be said  any of the challenged decisions had been made  There was no legal duty which mandamus could enforce   In written submissions on the costs issue the applicants  legal practitioner argued that the application was considered by him  to be the only legal relief available to resolve the legal assistance application   He said  There are no other legal avenues available   The practitioner argued further  at      The applicant s  sic  solicitors presented proper evidence and presented various authorities in support  The list of authorities filed   August   contained   authorities and the outline of submissions were well researched and were   pages long  The research and effort placed into the application was substantial and the facts were well presented  The parties agreed to a final hearing based on affidavit evidence only and that final hearing was relatively brief of     hours  The applicants did all they could to seek the intervention of the court in a diligent and cost effective manner considering the lack of financial capacity available      The practitioner submitted that an order that he pay the costs of the applicants would be  unfair and contrary to the authorities referred to above as the solicitors acted in their best endeavours on a bona fide basis with a proper and moral purpose to obtain legal assistance funding for the applicants in their best interests
