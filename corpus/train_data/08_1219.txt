fairness through inadvertence  because it was unaware of a letter seeking an adjournment of the hearing citedSBLF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   Anor   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  The proceeding before this Court is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court  published as SBLF v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   Anor   FMCA    The learned federal magistrate dismissed an application by the appellant for judicial review of the decision of the Tribunal  signed on   August   and handed down on   August    The Tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  now the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  the first respondent to this appeal   in both cases  the Minister  refusing to grant to the appellant a protection visa   It is accepted that the appellant is a citizen of Albania  who arrived in Australia on   November   having obtained a visa to travel to Australia by using a false Italian passport  On   November   the appellant applied for a protection visa  On   February   the Minister s delegate made a decision to refuse to grant the visa  The appellant then applied to the Tribunal for review of that decision  Having been unsuccessful in that application  the appellant filed an application in the Federal Magistrates Court  for relief of the kind available under s  B of the Judiciary Act    Cth  on   September    He filed an amended application on   April    The federal magistrate heard the application on   April   and gave judgment on   August     By s   of the Migration Act    Cth   the Migration Act   there is a class of visas to be known as protection visas  A criterion for a protection visa is that the person applying for it be a non citizen in Australia to whom the Minister is satisfied that Australia has protection obligations under the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol  The terms  Refugees Convention  and  Refugees Protocol  are defined in s   of the Migration Act to mean respectively the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on   July   and the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees done at New York on   January    It is convenient to call those two instruments  taken together  the  Convention   For present purposes  it is sufficient to note that Australia has protection obligations to any person who  owing to well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race  religion  nationality  membership of a particular social group or political opinion  is outside the country of his nationality and is unable  or owing to such fear  is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country  The appellant attempted to establish a well founded fear of being persecuted  should he return to Albania  for reasons of religion and political opinion  He claimed that he professed the Catholic religion  in a country dominated by Muslims  and was consequently in danger of persecution by reason of his religion  He also claimed that he had expressed publicly his opposition to an extremist Muslim political party and so was in danger of persecution on the ground of political opinion  He claimed to have been assaulted and beaten severely  He claimed that shots had been fired at him  He claimed that his parents had been forced to sell their house for less than its value and to move their place of residence because of threats  He claimed that his persecutors were still making inquiries of his parents in Albania as to the appellant s whereabouts  and still making threats  He claimed to have been dismissed from employment  He said that he feared that  if he returned to Albania  the Muslims would make an example of him and would beat him and shoot him   Section   of the Migration Act provides that  if a valid application is made for review of an RRT reviewable decision  of which there is no dispute that the Minister s delegate s decision was one   the Tribunal must review the decision   By s     the Tribunal may  for the purposes of the review  exercise all the powers and discretions conferred by the Migration Act on the person who made the decision  It is well accepted that the Tribunal is required to perform its function by considering the subject matter of a decision of a delegate of the Minister afresh  on the material before the Tribunal  and not to decide whether that decision was correct on the material before the Minister s delegate  Section   of the Migration Act provides    The Tribunal  in carrying out its functions under this Act  is to pursue the objective of providing a mechanism of review that is fair  just  economical  informal and quick    The Tribunal  in reviewing a decision   a  is not bound by technicalities  legal forms or rules of evidence  and  b  must act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case   Division   of Pt   of the Migration Act contains provisions concerning the conduct by the Tribunal of a review  Among them is s     The Tribunal must invite the applicant to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review   Section   contains exceptions to this obligation  none of which is applicable to the present case   Also found in Div   of Pt   of the Migration Act is s  B    which provides  This Division is taken to be an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matters it deals with   The appellant s original application for a protection visa was made with the assistance of a registered migration agent  The substance of his claim to have a well founded fear of persecution for reasons of religion and political opinion was contained in a typewritten and signed statement   short paragraphs in length  The appellant s account of his experiences recorded in that statement was very brief  Before the Minister s delegate considered the matter  two invitations were sent to the appellant s migration agent  addressed to the appellant  offering opportunities to provide additional information to support the claims  The migration agent responded to the first invitation  without providing any substantive information  There was no response on behalf of the appellant to the second invitation  The Minister s delegate found that the appellant had  provided little or no evidence to support his claims   Consequently  the Minister s delegate was not satisfied that the appellant had a well founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason
