Notice  Capricorn Diamonds Investments Pty Ltd v Catto   VSC         VR   at         See also Brierley v Dextran Pty Ltd     ACLC   although the adjustment at settlement there  arose not in equity or under any statutory provision but by reason of the terms of the offer referrable to accretions  accruing for whatever reason  directly or indirectly to the shares  The offer in that case was to acquire the shares  with accretions for a cash sum  Where the offerees prior to settlement received benefits by way of accretions to the shares  an interim dividend  there was a set off available to the offeror to that extent  There was no issue as to what was the  cash sum  or whether the offer was for a  cash sum   The  cash sum  was     per share  The question was whether at settlement  the

paid in due course for the securities   It is not sufficient that at some indeterminate date in the future  if at all  a determinate amount of money may be calculated as the  cash sum  for the purpose

to evaluate whether the terms set out in a notice of compulsory acquisition give a fair value for the securities  it must determine this at or about the date that the notice was lodged with ASIC and the notice was despatched to shareholders  Capricorn at      This statutory evaluation by the Court necessarily requires that the  cash sum  be ascertainable as at the date of the notice  It would be an extraordinary result if this could be evaluated by the Court by reference to information not known or capable of being ascertained as at the date of the notice  Likewise the recipient of a notice of compulsory acquisition ought be able to calculate the definite cash sum in order  importantly  to decide whether or not to object   A formula or mechanism which is incapable of ascertaining a precise dollar amount for each of the shares in question at or about the date of a notice of compulsory acquisition does not  in my opinion  constitute a  cash sum  within the meaning of s  C a  of

followedFraser Henliens Pty Ltd v Cody   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  A creditors meeting had purported to fix the administration remuneration by approving specific sums of money for each of the first two weeks of the administration and prospectively approving further remuneration by reference to hourly rates set out in the creditors report subject to the committee of creditors reviewing and confirming the details of the remuneration claim  The hourly rates contained in the creditors  reports included a range of rates the administrators were entitled to charge for the same types of work  At   Finkelstein J said      The second reason is that even if it be permissible to  fix  remuneration prospectively by reference to a rate or scale of charges  such as an hourly rate  which is open ended and has no upper limit  which is what the administrators argue  here the resolutions go far beyond that  The natural meaning of the word  fix  in the context of an entitlement to  such remuneration as is fixed by a resolution of  creditors  is  so it seems to me  to quantify that remuneration  that is to calculate or ascertain the amount of remuneration  Mayne v Jaques   HCA         CLR          See also In re Gallard  Ex parte Harris     QB      Thus  remuneration will be  fixed  if it is stated as a money sum  or is based on a formula which is capable of being applied according to some objective standard so the sum  can be calculated or ascertained definitely  Fraser Henleins v Cody   HCA         CLR      In the case of a formula all the objective elements must be identified   Fraser Henliens Pty Ltd v Cody   HCA         CLR   concerned whether particular formulative phrases embodied in a Prices Regulation Order made under the Black Marketing Act   were so vague and uncertain as to make the order invalid as not fixing a price  Dixon J said  p   that a  bare power to  fix  a price cannot be validly exercised without naming a money sum  or prescribing a certain standard by the application of which it can be calculated or ascertained definitely  Otherwise the price is not  fixed   citedKing Gee Clothing Co Ltd v The
