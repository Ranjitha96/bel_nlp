S P I  Spirits  Cyprus  Ltd v Diageo Australia Ltd No      FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedAbela v Giew     WN  Part    NSW   The general approach is that where a party satisfies the Court that he or she generally desires to amend the pleadings so as to alter an existing claim or to introduce a new claim  leave should be granted unless the proposed amendment is so obviously futile that it would be struck out if it had appeared in the original pleading or would cause substantial injustice which cannot be compensated for in the manner indicated in   above

allowance of an amendment before a trial begins  when there is time for a proper defence to be filed  stands in a very different position from amendment towards the end of a trial  Ketteman v Hansel

relation to a beverage referred to as the Ruski RTD  Diageo opposes Spirits  amendments to paras   and    and related paras   and   of the proposed FASC on the basis that Spirits have not pleaded

business efficacy to a contract in support of the allegation that there are certain implied terms in the First Agreement  when read together with or amended by the Supplementary Agreements  First SPI Assignment and Second SPI Assignment   However  Diageo submits that it is trite that a statement of claim must only plead material facts and not evidence or legal propositions  O   r   North Western Salt Company Ltd v Electrolytic Alkali Company Ltd     KB   at    Accordingly  Diageo submitted that leave should not be granted with respect to the amendments in paras  C   D and  A to  C  They amount to statements of legal propositions and are embarrassing  For this reason  no leave should be given to amend paras   and   because Spirits have not pleaded any material facts in support of the amendments  When pressed  Senior Counsel for Spirits submitted that the opening words of para    By reason of the matters pleaded above      is a reference to paras   to  D of the proposed FASC  and that para  D is a pleading of fact  I tend to agree with the latter submission although it might be more accurate to describe para  D as a pleading of mixed fact and law  as it would be to describe a number of the other pleadings from para   onwards appliedQueensland v J L Holdings Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlThe starting point is that all of such

Ltd     FCR   citedTruth About Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd   ATPR    The basis of Diageo s opposition to a grant of leave with respect to the proposed amendments in   is that Spirits have failed to plead material facts in support of their amended causes of action and that the proposed amendments are embarrassing because they do not enable Diageo to understand and plead to the new causes of action  Diageo submits that a pleading must state with particular clarity the factual basis upon which a foundation of a cause of action under Pt V of the Trade Practices Act    Cth   the TPA  is based  Truth About Motorways Pty Ltd v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Ltd   ATPR     at    I am not sure that I fully comprehend what lies behind the submission that the proposed amendments are embarrassing to Diageo  Diageo s submission that it is unable to understand and plead a response flies in the face of a plea in denial  such a pleading may turn out to be embarrassing  but any embarrassment in those circumstances will be at the feet of Spirits  articulation of their pleading and not at the feet of Diageo s response  I do not view such a prospect as a basis for necessarily withholding leave to amend  in certain circumstances it may be  The real issue on the motion is whether such circumstances exist in the present case
