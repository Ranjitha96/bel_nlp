Pty Ltd  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The respondents were represented  on the hearing of the winding up application  by Norman Carey their common director who was given leave to represent them  Mr Carey had applied to strike out the application in August   on the basis that it was invalid for failure to comply with s  Q of the Act which requires verification  by affidavit  of the currency of the debts at the time of the making of the application  On   August   that motion was dismissed Australian Securities   Investments Commission v Eastlands Pty Ltd  No     FCA    Other interlocutory orders refusing leave to issue certain subpoenas and requiring ASIC to provide a list of documents in its possession relevant to the question of solvency were made on the same day Australian Securities   Investments Commission v Eastlands Pty Ltd  No     FCA     At the commencement of the substantive hearing counsel appeared for the respondents and applied for an adjournment  That application was refused  Counsel  whose instructions were limited to the application for an adjournment  then withdrew and Mr Carey represented the respondent companies in person   At the hearing ASIC relied upon a number of affidavits including those of Oren Zohar and ASIC investigators  Kevin Chin and Richard Gomm  It also relied upon the affidavit of Wendy Chan  formerly an assistant accountant with Westpoint Corporation and David McEvoy  a partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers  The affidavits went variously to the records of intragroup debts in the books of Westpoint Corporation  the financial position of the respondents as disclosed in computer databases held by Westpoint Corporation  the way in which the accounting system operated  the service of the relevant statutory demands and of the originating process and supporting affidavits  There were no affidavits relied upon by the respondents  However Mr Carey gave oral evidence at the hearing   The submissions by ASIC outlined the evidence upon which it relies in relation to each of the respondents  The factual outline in its submissions  with respect to each of the respondents  was supported by reference to the relevant parts of the affidavits filed in support of the application  It is convenient to refer to that outline in respect of each of the contested applications  It is not necessary to repeat individually the reference to the basis upon which the debts were asserted  the service of the statutory demands  the non compliance with those demands and the currency of the relevant debts    Eastlands Pty Ltd  Eastlands  Eastlands has two issued shares  one held by Heca Nominees Pty Ltd  Heca  and the other by Mr Carey  Mr Carey is the company s only director   Eastlands is trustee of the Eastlands Unit Trust  The computer database containing the financial records of Westpoint Corporation and associated companies was kept on a  Triumph  accounting system  According to Mr Richard Gomm  an ASIC investigator  who examined records obtained by ASIC from that system in relation to Eastlands  its business records are almost exclusively concerned with its role as trustee of the Eastlands Unit Trust  The records relating to the Trust  as appears from Mr Gomm s affidavit of   October   indicate that       a  Eastlands Unit Trust earned no income and incurred expenses leaving a net loss before tax of     for the seven months to   January       b  At   January   the Eastlands Unit Trust had     i  net liabilities of     by way of a bank overdraft or debit

Auscott Ltd   NSWSC         ACSR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  In Lavercombe v Auscott Ltd   NSWSC         ACSR   Barrett J said  at        As to the apparent non compliance with s  Q b i  it cannot be contended that it caused the application to be a nullity  In circumstances where the necessary document was in fact annexed to the supporting affidavit rather than the contemporaneously filed originating process  the non compliance was a  defect or irregularity in connection with the application  as referred to in s  A a  and  since no injustice could conceivably have been occasioned  the court was bound by s  A not to dismiss the application merely because of the non compliance   In this case ASIC submits that no injustice could conceivably have been occasioned  If there were substantial injustice the time to raise it was at the time of the application to strike out the proceedings for failing to comply with s  Q of the Act made on   August    That application went to the sufficiency of the backing affidavit  I accept that this is a case in which there is no substantial injustice arising from non compliance with s  Q b i  and on that basis will entertain the application notwithstanding the non compliance   In so doing I apply s  A which provides     An application under Part     or    A must not be dismissed merely because of one or more of the following           a  in any case a defect or irregularity in connection with the application       b  in the case of an application for a company to be wound up in insolvency a defect in a statutory demand          Unless the Court is satisfied that substantial injustice has been caused that cannot otherwise be remedied  for example  by an adjournment or an order for costs       Having regard to s  A it is unnecessary to make any order under s   as was also suggested by ASIC
