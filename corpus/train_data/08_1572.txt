CEMEX Australia Pty Ltd v Takeovers Panel   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAssociated Provincial Picture Houses Limited v Wednesbury Corporation     KB   CEMEX challenges the orders made by the Panel on grounds that may be summarised as follows           The orders were not authorised by s  D   as that provision         a  did not authorise the Panel to order a person to pay an amount of money to another person  either at all or  alternatively  in the absence of satisfaction that the latter person has suffered loss or damage as a result of the circumstances declared to be unacceptable  and     b  did not authorise the Panel to delegate to ASIC the duty to decide whether a person must pay an amount of money to another person            the Panel improperly exercised the power conferred by s  D by         a  failing to take into account relevant considerations  being whether CEMEX s conduct constituted a contravention of Chapters    A   B or  C of the Act  whether any Affected Shareholder relied on or suffered loss as a result of any conduct on the part of CEMEX  and whether the takeover bid would have proceeded differently  if the unacceptable circumstances had not occurred  and     b  making a decision in the context of the absence of evidence concerning the extent to which the rights or interests of Affected Shareholders were actually affected by the unacceptable circumstances  that being unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense        The Panel erred in law within the meaning of s  f  of the ADJR Act in various respects  arising out of the above grounds  including by concluding that an order could be made to  protect  rights or interests which no longer existed at the time the orders were made   These grounds raise three issues    whether the Panel had power to order CEMEX to pay each Affected Shareholder     in respect of each share sold during the Relevant Period in the absence of a finding that each Affected Shareholder had suffered a loss    whether the orders involved an impermissible delegation of power to ASIC  and   whether the orders invalidly attempted to  protect  rights or interests that no longer existed   The essence of this complaint is that s  D a  while the Panel is authorised to make orders that protect rights or interests affected by the unacceptable circumstances  it is not given power to order that payment be made to individuals who have not shown financial loss  Consequently  where there is no evidence before the Panel that any individual Rinker shareholder suffered financial loss as a result of CEMEX s conduct order for payment is beyond power  The absence of such evidence meant the Panel was not in a position to determine whether there was a  reasonable connection between the extent to which the right interest has been affected and the extent to which it is sought to be protected   As CEMEX stated in its written submissions  In the absence of such evidence  the Panel lacked the ability to determine whether any person s rights or interests had been affected and whether any order made by it would  protect  the shareholders  rights interests  This is because individual shareholders may have suffered no loss or may have suffered a loss lesser or greater than the final dividend   It follows that CEMEX s argument that the Panel improperly failed to take into account whether their conduct constituted a contravention of Chapters    A   B or  C of the Corporations Act must be rejected  It also follows from my findings that the Panel s orders cannot be said to be unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense  Associated Provincial Picture Houses Limited v Wednesbury Corporation     KB     CEMEX alleges that the orders involve an impermissible delegation of power in that they establish  by orders     a mechanism by which ASIC is given the power to determine authoritatively whether a person is an Affected Shareholder and is therefore entitled to the payment  The mechanism set up by orders     is as follows         CEMEX may refer a claim to ASIC  within   weeks of CEMEX or the ISP receiving the claim form  whichever is earlier   CEMEX must provide to ASIC  with the referred claim form  the reasons it considers that the person submitting the claim form may not be entitled to the payment set out in the claim form because             a  CEMEX considers that the person submitting the claim form is not an Affected Shareholder   b  Special Circumstances do not apply   c  CEMEX dispute some or all of the details  supporting documents or evidence submitted in all with the claim form  or   d  CEMEX considers that payments have already been made or claimed for in respect of some or all of the Rinker shares claimed for               If CEMEX refers a claim form to ASIC under Order   ASIC shall within   weeks of receipt of that claim form make a determination  after consultation with CEMEX if ASIC considers it desirable  as to whether or not the person submitting the claim form is entitled to be paid in accordance with the Orders and if necessary  for how many Rinker shares      If ASIC is unable to make a determination under Order   it shall refer the claim form to the Panel within   weeks of receipt by ASIC of that claim form for decision   According to CEMEX  where the power to determine authoritatively whether a person falls within the group is delegated to a third party it is not possible for the review Panel to reach the requisite state of satisfaction that the rights or interests of a group of person have been affected referred toAttorney General  Cth  v Alinta Ltd   HCA         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It may well be that the Panel s concern to make quite clear that it was not basing its decision on a finding that there had been a contravention of the Corporations Act was because its decision predated the decision of the High Court in Attorney General  Cth  v Alinta Ltd   HCA         ALR    At the time  therefore  the question of whether s  A b  involved the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth had not been authoritatively determined   The review Panel rejected CEMEX s submission that the terms of its best and final offer should be construed as retaining for CEMEX a discretion whether or not it would deduct the amount of the dividend paid to Rinker shareholders or that it had qualified its   April announcement by reserving such a discretion  It referred to analysts  reports submitted by CEMEX and found that of the seven reports submitted  only one expressed the view that CEMEX could allow Rinker shareholders to retain the benefit of the final dividend  two expressed a contrary view and the others did not address the matter   The review Panel also referred to the statement made by Rinker on   April   when it announced the final dividend of      The Rinker announcement said  Shareholders should note that under the terms of CEMEX s takeover offer for Rinker  CEMEX has the right to deduct the amount of the dividend  or an amount equal to its value  as are reasonably assessed by CEMEX  from the offer price payable to accepting shareholders who have or will receive that dividend   The Panel considered that the  ordinary reading of the statement  would merely remind shareholders of the terms of CEMEX s offer and would not convey the meaning that CEMEX might improve its offer  by allowing them to retain a dividend   The regulatory framework which Chapter   establishes is  as Gleeson CJ observed in Attorney General  Cth  v Alinta Ltd at   designed  to preserve an efficient  competitive and informed capital market   Section  A  recognises that the conduct of a takeover may be inconsistent with such a market even where it does not contravene a specific provision of the Corporations Act   Emmett J recognised this in Glencore International AG v Takeovers Panel   FCA         FCR   at   The panel  of course  is expressly empowered by s  A  to make declarations notwithstanding that there has been no contravention of the Act  Part     of the Act provides flexibility in the regulation of the acquisition of shares in circumstances where the literal operation of the regulatory regime is either unnecessarily restrictive or ineffective to achieve the object of Ch    It is clear enough that the regime involving the panel is designed to ensure regulation of the acquisition of shares over and above the provisions contained in the balance of Ch       The panel made its declaration because  notwithstanding compliance by Glencore and the Banks with the disclosure regime prescribed by the Act  the purposes of Ch   as expressed in s     were not achieved  That is precisely the circumstance for which s  A provides  It is not unreasonable for the panel  if its decision was otherwise lawful and authorised  to reach that conclusion discussedAustralian Securities   Investments Commission v Yandal Gold Pty Ltd     ASCR   In Australian Securities   Investments Commission v Yandal Gold Pty Ltd     ASCR   Merkel J considered a contravention of s   of the then applicable Corporations Law   Section   empowered the Court to  make such order or orders as it thinks just  and s   empowered a court to make  such orders as it thinks necessary or desirable to protect the interests of a person affected by the takeover scheme   His Honour held at     However  there might be a more appropriate and just remedy  It relates to Edensor s carried interest  Mr Lonergan s evidence  which valued that interest at     million  was only partly challenged by the respondents  As explained earlier  that is effectively the  price  paid by the Normandy group to Edensor to secure the bid structure agreement and the Shareholders Agreement or  put another way  a measure of the benefit obtained by Edensor by its contraventions of s    As a consequence of the payment of that  price  the shareholders were deprived of the opportunity of receiving an offer of a significantly higher price at the time of the bid and were left with little practical choice but to accept the offer made or to now exercise their right to require the acquisition by Yandal Gold of their shares pursuant to s    Is it just that that  price  be redirected to those who suffered the detriment arising from its payment  In my view an order that Edensor be required to disgorge to those shareholders the value of the benefit it received for its contravening conduct is  just  under s   and is protective of the interests of the shareholders under s     It follows from the above that I am satisfied that the Panel made no error in making the orders   For all of the above reasons the application must be dismissed  In the ordinary course  the respondents  having been successful  would be entitled to their costs  However  neither party made any submissions as to costs either orally or in writing  That being so I shall allow all parties time to make submissions as to costs before making any orders    I certify that the preceding sixty seven   numbered paragraphs are a true copy

Panel to make orders on the basis of a so called   en globo   assessment of the likely loss or damages suffered by Rinker shareholders was said by CEMEX to be supported by Emmett J s comments in Glencore International AG v Takeovers Panel     ACSR   at   where his Honour said   T he review panel took no steps to determine whether  and if so  in what manner  any right or interest of any such person was affected by the non disclosure  While the orders were purportedly made for the purposes of protecting the rights or interests of persons affected by the non disclosure  the order applied indiscriminately to any person who sold shares on ASX during the relevant period  irrespective of whether any such person would have taken any different course had the relevant disclosure been made   This submission does not take account of the amendments to the Corporations Act made by the Corporations Amendment  Takeovers  Act    Cth   The Explanatory Memorandum to the corresponding Bill makes it clear that the amendments were designed to respond to the concern that  following Glencore    it may be open to read the Panel s powers and jurisdiction in the current legislation in way that is too narrowly formulated to enable the Panel to perform effectively the role envisaged for it by Parliament  in particular the power to make orders to protect the rights or interests of persons affected by unacceptable circumstances  In relation to s  D a  the Explanatory Memorandum stated  Paragraph  D a  of the Act currently allows the Panel to make orders it thinks appropriate to protect the rights or interests of any person affected by the circumstances  The amendment means that this is not confined to rights and interests directly affected by the circumstances  The amendment ensures that the Panel can make any order it thinks appropriate to protect any rights or interests of a person or group of persons  where the Panel is satisfied that their rights or interests have been  are being  will be or are likely to be affected by the unacceptable circumstances  This will allow the Panel to protect the interests of those persons more effectively  The amendment will also ensure that the Panel may make orders which protect the interests of a group of persons whose interests have been affected  rather than requiring it to address the effects person by person   Emphasis added   I am satisfied that the Court was entitled to proceed en globo in its assessment of the extent to which shareholder s rights or interests were affected by the unacceptable circumstances  First  as well as being consistent with the express words of s  D a   if the Panel is satisfied that the rights or interest of any person  or a group of persons      such an approach recognises that the unacceptable circumstances misinformed the market as to the status of CEMEX s offer  thereby affecting the rights and interests of vendors of Rinker shares in that market  as a group  Counsel for ASIC  in my view accurately  summarised the steps taken by the Panel as follows    identifying a group of persons  namely those who sold their Rinker shares between   April and   May     identifying the interests of those persons affected by the conduct  being the interest in ensuring that the relevant trading occurred in an efficient and informed market  and the interest in having a reasonable opportunity to participate in the benefits of the improved offer    making a finding that the market value of the improved offer consideration was around     and    forming the view that an appropriate order was to compensate those persons in that amount discussedGlencore International AG v Takeovers Panel   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The regulatory framework which Chapter

for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The ADJR Act provides that an improper exercise of power includes  inter alia  taking an irrelevant consideration into account in the exercise of the power and failing to take a relevant consideration into account  s    CEMEX submitted that in declining to have regard to whether its conduct gave rise to a contravention of Chapters    A   B  or  C of the Corporations Act or was otherwise contrary to law  the Panel ignored a consideration that it was bound to take into account in making the decision  Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR   at      It is not in dispute that the Panel expressly declined to consider this question  Therefore the only issue for me to decide on this point is whether the Panel was required to have regard to it   Section  A a ii  imposes an obligation on the Panel  when contemplating a declaration of unacceptable circumstances  to have regard to  the other provisions of this Chapter    CEMEX submitted that  because of the express reference in s  A c  to Chapters  A   B and  C  the obligation extends also to those chapters  It accepted that a declaration of unacceptable circumstances may be made even if the circumstances do not give rise to a contravention of the Act  s  A   It submitted  however  that a consideration need not be determinative to render it relevant  CEMEX referred to the Panel s observation that forming a view about whether a contravention had occurred would only be one aspect of considering whether the circumstances were unacceptable  It argued that it did not follow that the issue could be ignored   CEMEX s submissions advocate a mechanistic approach to the interpretation of s  A a   This is not what the section requires  An obligation to have regard to Chapter   does not require the decision maker to consider whether there has been a contravention of each and every applicable provision  The task of the Panel was to consider whether  as ASIC alleged  unacceptable circumstances had arisen  Section  A a  sets out the matters that it is mandatory for the Panel to consider  The question of whether there has been a contravention of Chapters    A   B   C is not included as a mandatory matter  The fact that s  A  specifically provides that it is not necessary for there to be a contravention of a provision of the Act  indicates that if the Panel considered CEMEX s conduct resulted in unacceptable circumstances irrespective of there being a contravention  it was not necessary for it to consider if there had been a contravention  It is clear that the fact of a contravention would be highly relevant to the question of whether the circumstances should be characterised as  unacceptable   If  however  such circumstances exist irrespective of a contravention  it is not necessary for the Panel to consider that issue citedQueen v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal  ex parte Hardiman   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Before discussing the Panel s decision  a brief overview of its composition and function is appropriate  The following outline  draws heavily on the submissions made by the Panel  which  consistent with the principle in Queen v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal  ex parte Hardiman   HCA         CLR   at     made submissions limited to the Panel s powers and procedures and not in the role of a protagonist   The written submissions of the Panel outlined its history  commencing with its establishment under Part   of the Australian Securities Commission Act    Cth   When that Act was repealed and replaced by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act    Cth    ASIC Act   the Panel continued in existence by operation of s   of that Act  Initially  the Panel was known as the Corporations and Securities Panel  Its name was changed to the  Takeovers Panel  by the Financial Services Reform Act    Cth   Interesting as the history is  it is not necessary to refer to it in any detail and I shall confine my comments to the present constitution and operation of the Panel   The members of the
