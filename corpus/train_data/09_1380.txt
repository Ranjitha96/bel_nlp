Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA         CLR   at     SZFDV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA         CLR   at      The appellants criticise the Tribunal s further conclusion that the appellants would not need to surrender any fundamental rights that are currently protected by the Convention categories if they were to relocate  They say that this indicates that the Tribunal misdirected itself as to the test to be applied and failed to ascertain whether it was reasonable for the appellants to relocate in a practical sense  I accept the Minister s submission that this aspect of the Tribunal s reasons was directed to the considerations described in SZATV at    It is clear that this was an additional consideration taken into account by the Tribunal in order to deal not only with the question of reasonableness of relocation but also with any suggestion  although not advanced  that the appellants would give up such fundamental rights as a price of relocation  I am not satisfied that the Tribunal applied the wrong test in assessing reasonableness  The test for relocation is whether it is reasonable in the sense of being practicable in the particular circumstances of the particular applicant   SZATV at    The answer to that question  in turn  depends upon the framework set by the particular objections raised to relocation  see SZMCD v
