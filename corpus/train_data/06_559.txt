White v Huxtable  in the matter of Lake Federation Pty Ltd  receivers   managers appointed    FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlapprovedRe One Tel Networks Holdings Pty Ltd     ACSR   However  in the course of argument  counsel for the plaintiffs made it clear that the form of direction sought was based upon  and confined to  a direction of the kind made by Austin J in Re One Tel Networks Holdings Pty Ltd     ACSR     One Tel   and or by Hodgson J in Re Vartex Petroleum Industries Pty Ltd  Unreported  Supreme Court of New South Wales  Hodgson J    August     Vartex     It was accepted by counsel for the plaintiffs that the revised form of direction would be appropriate in the circumstances and the defendants did not oppose a direction expressed in those more limited terms   Similar views have been expressed in other cases  In One Tel   Austin J said that there is some doubt as to whether directions of a court given under a section of this kind can bind anyone  even a party to the application  citing Best   Less   at      In Vartex   Hodgson J was less equivocal  stating that a direction would not bind a director of the company who was represented before the court   In One Tel  Austin J made a similar observation  at        In these circumstances  it seems to me that a direction in terms of  the proposed direction  is justified  I hesitate to use the word  declare  which suggests a binding declaration of right rather than a direction having the more limited significance that I have described  I note that the word  declare  is used in some of the cases  no doubt in a special sense  but I have decided it would be better to use the word  direct  which is sanctioned by s   itself  While Hodgson J in Vartex Petroleum indicated a willingness to direct that the proposed sale was not  improper  by virtue of the mere fact that it was from a receiver to the mortgagee  I would prefer not to use the word  improper  which might suggest a conclusion with respect to the factual circumstances of the sale and the bona fides of the plaintiff   Other limits on the court s power to give directions under s   have been discussed in the authorities  In particular  the authorities make it clear that it is not appropriate for the court to give directions about the commercial propriety or reasonableness of a transaction that the receiver proposes to enter into  see One Tel at         and     and Best   Less at     and    In Franbridge Pty Ltd v Societ    Generale Finance Corporation Pty Ltd     ACSR     Franbridge    Einfeld J refused to make directions to the effect that a particular transaction was not improper and  more particularly  that the receiver had acted reasonably  at       The cases make it clear  however  that it may be appropriate to make a direction to the effect that a particular transaction is not unlawful solely because the counter party to the transaction is a company associated with the entity which appointed the receivers and managers  This is precisely what was done by Hodson J in Vartex  In that case  his Honour referred to the principle of mortgage law that a mortgagee cannot exercise a power of sale in favour of itself  the mortgagee principle  and went on to find that the mortgagee principle does not apply so as to prevent a receiver appointed by a mortgagee from selling the mortgage property to the mortgagee who appointed him  The same approach was adopted by Austin J in One Tel at          Moreover  in Re Actwane Pty Ltd   NSWSC     Actwane    Austin J followed the approach in Vartex and One Tel and made a direction that         notwithstanding the principle of mortgage law that the mortgagee cannot exercise a power of sale in favour of itself  it would not be unlawful for the plaintiff to    enter into an agreement with Temujin Securities Pty Ltd solely by reason of the fact that the Appointor of the Receiver and Manager under a Deed of Appointment dated   August   is also the director and sole shareholder of Temujin Securities Pty Ltd   In the circumstances that I have described and in the light of the authorities I have discussed  I consider that it is appropriate in this case to make a direction in the revised form sought by the plaintiffs  That form closely adheres to the form of order made by Hodson J in Vartex  In my view  it is much clearer to provide that the Contract is not  unlawful solely by reason of  the relationship between TIGA and Thorney than to use the form of words which appeared in the originating process in this case  namely  notwithstanding the relationship between  TIGA and receivers  appointor  Thorney  I appreciate that Austin J in One Tel used the form of words  notwithstanding  etc  but I prefer the more direct expression  not unlawful solely by reason of   I also note that Austin J used the expression  solely by reason of  in Actwane    Like Austin J in One Tel and Hodson J in Vartex   I would stress that the direction is intended to establish only that the Contract is not unlawful by reason of the relationship between TIGA and Thorney  The direction does not deal with the position of the plaintiffs under the law concerning the proper exercise of powers of sale by a receiver and manager  which depends upon considerations relating to good faith  proper procedure and fair price  I am not expressing any view about those matters  nor is it appropriate to do so in a summary procedure such as this  where a limited direction only was sought  However  I would add that nothing I have seen on the evidence before me suggests any impropriety on the part of the receivers and managers   Several grounds were advanced by the defendants in support of the application  Firstly  the originating process filed by the plaintiffs sought a direction that was expressed in wider terms  the defendants say significantly wider  than the revised form ultimately obtained by the plaintiffs without opposition from the defendants  The original form of the direction concerned not only the lawfulness of entering into the Contract with TIGA  notwithstanding its relationship with Thorney  but also sought a direction that the Contract was not  improper   on the facts and in the circumstances presently known to them   The defendants submitted that the original form was suggestive that the plaintiffs were seeking a direction from the Court which went towards the commercial reasonableness of the plaintiffs  conduct  and was a direction of the kind that Austin J refused to make in One Tel    Secondly  the defendants argued that their appreciation of the wide scope of the original form of the direction was a reasonable one in view of Mr White s affidavit of   February    Paragraph   of the affidavit expressed Mr White s belief that he had taken all reasonable care in selling the Lake Federation property and had performed his obligations under s  A  of the Corporations Act to sell the property for market value  and that he had sufficiently tested the market so as to obtain an offer that was not less than market value  Mr White s affidavit does  to some extent at least  tend to support the defendant s view that they thought they were coming to oppose a direction which sought court approbation of the reasonableness of the receivers  conduct  Perhaps another factor relevant to the defendants  appreciation of the scope of the direction sought by the plaintiffs is the form of the special condition and definition of  Court Approval  in the Contract   In opposition to the defendants  application for costs  counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that  as a matter of substance  the direction sought by the plaintiffs was always confined within the limits indicated by the Vartex and One Tel cases  Counsel for the plaintiffs also submitted that the lengthy affidavit by Mr White was entirely appropriate because the Court needed to have before it a full account of the transactions that had led up to the contract of sale in question  I accept the latter point that the affidavit material was entirely appropriate in supporting the discretionary order that was sought from the Court  even assuming it was always limited in the form of the direction that I have made  However  I consider that the defendants were affected in their opposition to the direction because of the wider way in which it was originally cast followedRe Vartex Petroleum Industries Pty Ltd  Unreported  Supreme Court of New South Wales  Hodgson J    August   However  in the course of argument  counsel for the plaintiffs made it clear that the form of direction sought was based upon  and confined to  a direction of the kind made by Austin J in Re One Tel Networks Holdings Pty Ltd     ACSR     One Tel   and or by Hodgson J in Re Vartex Petroleum Industries Pty Ltd  Unreported  Supreme Court of New South Wales  Hodgson J    August     Vartex     It was accepted by counsel for the plaintiffs that the revised form of direction would be appropriate in the circumstances and the defendants did not oppose a direction expressed in those more limited terms   Similar views have been expressed in other cases  In One Tel   Austin J said that there is some doubt as to whether directions of a court given under a section of this kind can bind anyone  even a party to the application  citing Best   Less   at      In Vartex   Hodgson J was less equivocal  stating that a direction would not bind a director of the company who was represented before the court   In Vartex   Hodgson J was careful to point out that the direction he proposed to make had a very limited operation  The direction in Vartex was to the effect that a particular agreement for sale would not be improper merely because the purchaser was the appointor of the receivers  His Honour said that such advice would say nothing about the possibility that the sale may be improper because of particular dealings which may or may not have occurred between the appointor and the plaintiff  or on any other grounds unconnected with the mere identity of the purchaser as the mortgagee   The cases make it clear  however  that it may be appropriate to make a direction to the effect that a particular transaction is not unlawful solely because the counter party to the transaction is a company associated with the entity which appointed the receivers and managers  This is precisely what was done by Hodson J in Vartex  In that case  his Honour referred to the principle of mortgage law that a mortgagee cannot exercise a power of sale in favour of itself  the mortgagee principle  and went on to find that the mortgagee principle does not apply so as to prevent a receiver appointed by a mortgagee from selling the mortgage property to the mortgagee who appointed him  The same approach was adopted by Austin J in One Tel at          Moreover  in Re Actwane Pty Ltd   NSWSC     Actwane    Austin J followed the approach in Vartex and One Tel and made a direction that         notwithstanding the principle of mortgage law that the mortgagee cannot exercise a power of sale in favour of itself  it would not be unlawful for the plaintiff to    enter into an agreement with Temujin Securities Pty Ltd solely by reason of the fact that the Appointor of the Receiver and Manager under a Deed of Appointment dated   August   is also the director and sole shareholder of Temujin Securities Pty Ltd   In the present case  the deed of charge dated   October   provides that the receiver and manager from appointment is the agent of the chargor  Lake Federation  As Hodson J pointed out in Vartex   the consequence of that agency is that the sale of property by the receivers and managers to a company associated with the appointor does not infringe the mortgage principle  see also Franbridge at   and Actwane at       In the circumstances that I have described and in the light of the authorities I have discussed  I consider that it is appropriate in this case to make a direction in the revised form sought by the plaintiffs  That form closely adheres to the form of order made by Hodson J in Vartex  In my view  it is much clearer to provide that the Contract is not  unlawful solely by reason of  the relationship between TIGA and Thorney than to use the form of words which appeared in the originating process in this case

expressing any view about those matters  nor is it appropriate to do so in a summary procedure such as this  where a limited direction only was sought  However  I would add that nothing I have seen on the evidence before me suggests any impropriety on the part of the receivers and managers   Thirdly  the defendants point to Hodgson J s view in Vartex concerning the costs of an opposing director  It appears from Hodgson J s reasons for judgment that the form of direction sought in Vartex was wider than the one ultimately made and  in the result  Hodgson J ordered that the costs of the director be paid out of the funds in the hands of the receiver  see also Actwane   The defendants sought a similar order in the present case   In opposition to the defendants  application for costs  counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that  as a matter of substance  the direction sought by the plaintiffs was always confined within the limits indicated by the Vartex and One Tel cases  Counsel for the plaintiffs also submitted that the lengthy affidavit by Mr White was entirely appropriate because the Court needed to have before it a full account of the transactions that had led up to the contract of sale in question  I accept the latter point that the affidavit material was entirely appropriate in supporting the discretionary order that was sought from the Court  even assuming it was always limited in the form of the direction that I have made  However  I consider that the defendants were affected in their opposition to the direction because of the wider way in which it was originally cast   The plaintiffs have not obtained the full ambit of the relief which they originally sought  In the circumstances  I propose to make an order to the same effect as the order which Hodgson J made in Vartex   I will order that the costs of the defendants of and incidental to the application be paid out of the funds in the hands of the plaintiffs in their capacity as receivers and managers of Lake Federation   Pursuant to s   of the Corporations Act   I will make a direction in the revised form sought by the plaintiffs  that    It is not unlawful solely by reason of the relationship between TIGA  Ballarat  Pty Ltd  ACN        TIGA  and the appointor of the plaintiffs  Thorney Properties  Ballarat  Pty Ltd  ACN       for the plaintiffs to enter into the contract of sale dated

    ACSR   A number of cases indicate that a direction under s   of the Corporations Act has the limited force I have described  In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Best   Less  Wollongong  Pty Ltd     ACSR     Best   Less    Lockhart J said that the extent to which directions of the court under s   and similar sections can bind anyone is a matter of considerable doubt  at    His Honour said that the court plainly cannot give directions as to the rights of persons who are not parties to the hearing of the application  Moreover  even if persons are joined as parties to the application  his Honour said that it is doubtful they can be bound in a sense that can give rise to an issue estoppel  Lockhart J added at   that     i t would still be open for a company or person to sue a receiver and manager    for breach of duty  even if he had followed the court s instruction  although he could rely upon the giving of those directions if he seeks relief under s   of the Corporations Law

HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In Australasian Memory Pty Ltd v Brien   HCA         CLR   at     the High Court said that the powers conferred by s  A are wide  but they are not entirely without limit  The High Court found that there is nothing on the face of s  A  that suggests it should be read down  it confers power to make orders which will have effect in the future  Their Honours said that the orders contemplated by s  A  go beyond a curial determination of what is the effect of existing provisions of the Part in relation to a particular company  and contemplate orders that alter how Part    A is to operate in relation to a particular company under administration   The power under s  A is extremely wide  This may explain the preparedness of the Goldberg J in Re Ansett to give directions approving a particular agreement to be entered into by the administrators  In that case  Goldberg J noted that it is not the role of the court to make a commercial judgment for the liquidators or administrators or to substitute its judgment for their judgment  but then added at      A lthough courts will not pronounce upon the commercial prudence of a particular transaction  they will act in an appropriate case to protect liquidators and administrators from claims that they have acted unreasonably in entering into particular transactions  That protection will remain so long as the liquidators or administrators have made a full and fair disclosure to the court of all facts material to the subject matter under consideration   In Re Ansett   Goldberg J give a direction under s  A that the Court approved a particular contractual arrangement that the administrators proposed to enter into citedRe Ansett Australia Ltd     ACSR   Another case to similar effect is Re Ansett Australia Ltd     ACSR   at         and      In that case  Goldberg J acknowledged that the Court should not give directions as to whether or not a decision made by the administrators is a commercial decision  However  his Honour said at            where issues as to the propriety or reasonableness of the conduct undertaken  or the decision made  by an administrator is called in question  it is open to the court to give a direction which  in substance  sanctions or approves the conduct undertaken  or decision made  by the administrator   His Honour also said that in so far as it might be thought that it was implicit in his reasons for directing that the administrators may properly perform and give effect to the agreement  that was a necessary and inevitable consequence of a consideration of the propriety and reasonableness of the conduct of the administrators in entering into and seeking to perform and give effect to the agreement  at       It therefore seems that  while ss   and  A of the Corporations Act have their respective limits  the courts have been prepared to go further into the commercial arena in making directions under the wider power conferred by s  A than they have in giving directions to receivers under s   approvedRe Actwane Pty Ltd   NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  The cases make it clear  however  that it may be appropriate to make a direction to the effect that a particular transaction is not unlawful solely because the counter party to the transaction is a company associated with the entity

approach in Vartex and One Tel and made a direction that         notwithstanding the principle of mortgage law that the mortgagee cannot exercise a power of sale in favour of itself  it would not be unlawful for the plaintiff to    enter into an agreement with Temujin Securities Pty Ltd solely by reason of the fact that the Appointor of the Receiver and Manager under a Deed of Appointment dated   August   is also the director and sole shareholder of Temujin Securities Pty Ltd
