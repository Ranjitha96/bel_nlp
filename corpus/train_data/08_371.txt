Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I accept that these authorities support the proposition that contemporaneously executed contracts forming part of the same transaction should  as a general rule  be read as a whole and construed by reference to each other  Star City Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation   FCA   at     However  it would go well beyond any concept of contractual context to alter the terms of one contemporaneously executed contract by reference to another where  as here    the parties to each contract are not the same    the term in the contract in question is not ambiguous  and   the term in the other contract is directly conflicting  This is especially so where the result is to require an essential term  such as the duration of the contract  to be amended from the written terms of one contract to obtain consistency between the two contracts  To do so would disrupt the longstanding rule that parties are bound by the unambiguous terms of their written agreement unless it is affected by fraud  mistake or misrepresentation  Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR           and    The terms of the Nepalle Guarantee  including its duration  are not ambiguous  In the absence of such ambiguity  the written document stands on its own as a record of the agreement between the parties to it   Westpac submitted that the   Kirszbaum Guarantee secures all of Middleton Nominees  current liability to Westpac including any liability of Middleton Nominees as guarantor of the Advance debt  The Applicants disputed that the   Kirszbaum Guarantee also secured the Advance debt on the ground that it could not be said that the Advance debt was of the same type or character as the original debt secured by the   Kirszbaum Guarantee or that the Advance transaction documents refer back to the   Kirszbaum Guarantee  In other words  the Applicants contended that it was not the intention of the parties for the Advance debt to be secured by the   Kirszbaum Guarantee and the Kirszbaum Properties  For the following reasons  I reject that submission     Terms of the   Kirszbaum Guarantee  The terms of the   Kirszbaum Guarantee are important  First  there is no limit on the amount to be paid under it  cl    Secondly  cl   is headed  What is Covered by this Guarantee   It provides      This document relates to all money which  Middleton Nominees  may owe to  Westpac  now or in the future for any reason     This is the   Guaranteed Money            At any time  the Guaranteed Money will also include the following              a  money which  Middleton Nominees  contingently owes  Westpac   money is  contingently  owed where the Customer has an obligation to pay  Westpac  if something happens or is discovered              b  Money which  Middleton Nominees  may owe  Westpac  after that time of something happens or is discovered  even where there is no existing obligation to pay it  so long as it arises out of or in relation to circumstances existing  foreseeable or contemplated at the time      c  Money which  Middleton Nominees  is or becomes liable to pay  Westpac  under another guarantee or indemnity          Thirdly  Westpac was under no obligation to do anything in relation to  or to tell Mrs Kirszbaum anything concerning  Middelton Nominees  affairs  finances or transactions with Westpac  The responsibility rested with Mrs Kirszbaum both before and after the guarantee was signed  cl    Moreover  Mrs Kirszbaum was liable to pay all Guaranteed Money including under replacement or changed  Arrangements  cl    The term  Arrangement  was defined in cl   to mean      any document  agreement or dealing of any sort between  Westpac  and  Middleton Nominees   whether or not with others  including where  Westpac  or  Middleton Nominees  becomes a party because of an assignment       Construction of the   Kirszbaum GuaranteediscussedEstoril Investments Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation     BPR   However  the Applicants contend that despite the unequivocal words of the   Kirszbaum Guarantee  the proper construction of the guarantee is not to be determined solely by reference to its express terms but by reference to what they describe as  general rules of construction  to be applied in determining the intention of the parties in respect of the  all moneys  or  dragnet clause   These general rules of construction were said to be found in the decision of Young J in Estoril Investments Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation     BPR      Those reasons for decision and the subsequent authorities do not support the Applicants  submission   In fact  what Young J summarised were not rules of construction but   guidelines which illustrate how court often approach dragnet clauses provided that the language permits them to do so    Estoril Investments     BPR   at   see also Smith v Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd   NSW ConvR      Nine  guidelines  were set out  They are no more than guidelines  What Young J did was to take a number of the guidelines and analyse whether the guidelines represented the position in Australia  The conclusion his Honour reached is best illustrated by looking at the second guideline that   only debts of the same type or character as the original debt are secured by the mortgage    After analysing the authorities in the United States  England  New Zealand and Australia  Young J concluded as follows      I also believe that it is fair to say that in many cases the Court will come to the view as stated in proposition   above  However  that is a very different thing from saying that there is some general rule that mortgages must be construed as if they were limited to debts of the same type as those for which the mortgage was originally taken out citedManks v Whiteley     Ch   Finally  in the circumstances  even if the
