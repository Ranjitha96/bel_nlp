Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  Ex parte Lai Qin   HCA         CLR   McHugh J observed at       In an appropriate case  a court will make an order for costs even when there has been no hearing on the merits and the moving party no longer wishes to proceed with the action  The court cannot try a hypothetical action between the parties  To do so would burden the parties with the costs of a litigated action which by settlement or extra curial action they had avoided  In some cases  however  the court may be able to conclude that one of the parties has acted so unreasonably that the other party should obtain the costs of the action  In administrative law matters  for example  it may appear that the defendant has acted unreasonably in exercising or refusing to exercise a power and that the plaintiff had no reasonable alternative but to commence a litigation     His Honour went on to state at     If it appears that both parties have acted reasonably in commencing and defending the proceedings and the conduct of the parties continued to be reasonable until the litigation was settled or its further prosecution became futile  the proper exercise of the cost discretion will usually mean that the court will make no order as to the cost of the proceedings  This approach has been adopted in a large number of cases  citedGribbles Pathology Pty Ltd v Health Insurance Commission     FCR   Finkelstein J arrived at that conclusion in Gribbles Pathology Pty Ltd v Health Insurance Commission     FCR     In the present case  the evidence shows that the last contact between the applicant and the Minister took place on   May    On that day  the assistant secretary of the Department for Environment and Heritage wrote to the managing director of the applicant stating  in effect  that the Minister s decision would need to await the receipt of information on the cumulative impact of wind farms  The letter said that the additional information was expected by the end of June    The material before me indicates that that timeframe was far too optimistic  The relevant material was not received by the Minister until some time on or about   February    However  the letter did make it clear that the Minister would not be able to make an informed decision on the Bald Hills Wind Farm until he received that information  The letter also said that  in the view of the Department  the statutory time frame for making the decision had been refreshed and had not at that time expired   There is no evidence of later communications between the applicant and the Minister  This has some significance  having regard to Heerey J s decision in   Eleven   In that case  Heerey J made an order for costs not simply because of the lengthy delay of over two years in making the decision  but also the fact that the applicant  before commencing proceedings  had given notice of intention to bring the proceedings to the Commission and that two promises by the Commission to make a decision had not been fulfilled   In this case  Ms Nance  counsel for the Minister  accepts that the statutory time limit had expired and that the decision was out of time  However she submits that the applicant was aware that the Minister had deferred a decision awaiting a report which  in the event  was not finalised until February    In all the circumstances  I am not satisfied that this is a case where it can be said that the Minister has acted so unreasonably that I should make an order for costs in favour of the applicant   I appreciate the applicant s point that the Minister s lengthy delay  in disregard of a statutory time limit  led to the institution of proceedings  On the other hand  there was knowledge on the part of the applicant that the Minister was awaiting a report and I consider that there was a significant absence of communication  at least so far as the evidence goes  about the intention to commence the proceedings   In the circumstances  I consider that the appropriate orders are that the proceedings be dismissed that there be no order as to the costs of the proceedings  I will so order        I certify that the preceding thirteen
