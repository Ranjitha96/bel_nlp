Practices Commission     ALR   Hammond v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR   and Victoria v Australian Building Construction Employees   Builders Labourers  Federation   HCA         CLR   citedMann v Carnell   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In claiming confidentiality  albeit unsuccessfully  and in making this application for an interlocutory injunction  AWB has done everything within its power to prevent the publication of the documents  It is difficult to see why  in those circumstances  the step that the Inquiry wishes to take of publishing the documents on its website would increase the risk that AWB s conduct would be regarded as effecting a waiver of privilege over other documents  Imputed waiver arises where the party claiming legal professional privilege engages in conduct which is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect  Mann v Carnell   HCA         CLR   at        Secondly  the references to legal advice in the documents have essentially the same character as other disclosures that AWB has previously made to the Commission  Those disclosures have been the subject of evidence in public proceedings at the Inquiry  and are already in the public domain  It is difficult to see why the additional references in the documents to legal advice would alter the risk of waiver that AWB already confronts as a result of the prior publication of very similar material   Thirdly  in the course of this case  the Commonwealth has relied upon previous occasions on which AWB has disclosed the existence and substance of legal advice to contend that AWB has waived legal professional privilege over associated documents  Mr Harrison  senior counsel for the Commonwealth  informed the Court that the Commonwealth does not intend to rely upon the further references to legal advice in the documents in support of its waiver arguments in these proceedings   AWB argues that  even if these additional references are not to be relied upon by the Commonwealth in this case  that does not remove the risk that in another piece of litigation  at some later point  some other party will seek to rely upon these additional references to argue that AWB has thereby waived privilege over other documents  I do not think that this possible future circumstance supports AWB s contention that publication poses a real risk of interference with the processes of this Court or the administration of justice generally   AWB did not base its application on any contention that the first respondent had exercised his powers improperly or for any extraneous purpose  Its application was based solely on principles of contempt of Court   Turning to the balance of convenience  I am not satisfied that the publication of the documents will cause irreparable harm or any serious prejudice to AWB  In my view  the risk of prejudice to which AWB points is remote   I must also take account of the public interest in the conduct of the Inquiry and the first respondent s desire to conduct further proceedings in public at which these additional documents may be the subject of evidence  This consideration outweighs the remote risk of any prejudice to AWB
