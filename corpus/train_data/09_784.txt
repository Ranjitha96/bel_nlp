City of Swan v Lehman Bros Australia Ltd   FCA     July  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedAWB Limited v Cole  No       ALR  In AWB Limited v Cole  No       ALR   at         Young J reviewed the authorities from which  without reciting the authorities to which his Honour referred  I have taken the following principles      As a general rule the starting point is that all issues of fact and law should be determined at the one time       A party seeking the determination of separate questions must satisfy the Court that it is  just and convenient  for the order to be made  The order must be made on concrete facts  either established or agreed  for the purpose of quelling a controversy between the parties so as to produce a conclusive or final judicial decision on the issue  which is of a real  not hypothetical  importance to the determination of the controversy       There are special problems where the separate issue involves a mixed question of fact and law  although it may still be able to be decided as a separate issue  However  care must be taken in precisely formulating the question and specifying the facts upon which it is to be decided       The Court must have all relevant matters before it as a precondition of it being asked to exercise its discretion if the separate question involves the grant or refusal of declaratory relief       It may still be appropriate to determine a separate question even if it will not resolve all the issues  provided that there is a strong prospect that the parties will agree upon the result when the core of the dispute has been decided or if the decision will obviate unnecessary and expensive hearings of other questions       Generally speaking an issue will not be appropriate for separate determination if it is simply one of two or more alternative ways in which an applicant or plaintiff frames its case and its determination would leave other significant issues unresolved       It is relevant to consider whether discussedBass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlLehman Australia and the administrators argued that questions   and   were founded on the false assumption that apart from cl     the plaintiffs had an unqualified right  superior to Lehman Australia itself  to conduct  prosecute or resolve litigation with that company s insurers  It argued that the construction of cl     was not a matter of controversy and that it related only to claims against Lehman Australia being released  It argued that this construction would defeat the plaintiffs  contention that cl     was wider than its apparent terms   As appears above  Lehman Bros disputes this construction   Lehman Australia also argued that if the impugned provisions could not be supported by Pt    A of the Act  then the deed would still be valid but those clauses would not be an operative part of the deed  Lehman Australia argued that if question   were answered  no  it would not follow that the deed would then become ineffective or void  Accordingly it argued that question   was of no utility to resolve any issue  Lehman Australia referred to the dangers of separate issues discussed in Tepko Pty Ltd v Water Board   HCA         CLR   and Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd   HCA         CLR    In Woolcock Street   CLR at       Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Heydon JJ stressed the importance of recognising that there may be difficulties in using procedures for separate issues in cases in which it is necessary to consider developing  as distinct from applying  common law principles and continued     The dangers of developing common law principle against an artificially constricted body of fact are self evident  That is why  in some cases  even if the parties join in asking a court to determine a question separate from trial of the facts  it may be prudent for the court to decline to answer the question presented as being one which it is inappropriate to answer   Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd   HCA         CLR   at              Indeed  as Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd illustrates   Bass   HCA         CLR   at       See also Malika Holdings Pty Ltd v Stretton   HCA         CLR   at          in some circumstances to answer a question may be contrary to the judicial process  If the question is answered  it is important to identify any limitations which the procedure adopted may impose on the breadth of any principle that is to be identified as having been established or applied  If some or all of the separate questions can be answered they may prove decisive and  in any event  will clarify the future extent of the controversy so as to facilitate its efficient management  As Gleeson CJ  Gaudron  McHugh  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ pointed out in Bass   CLR at     a crucial difference between an advisory opinion and a declaratory judgment      is the fact that an advisory opinion is not based on a concrete situation and does not amount to a binding decision raising a res judicata between parties   What the plaintiffs seek will lead to a binding decision on a concrete situation  at least on the issues of construction and  if the questions as to power or any of them are answered in their favour  will be likely further to narrow the controversy considerably citedBowen Investments Pty Ltd v

Pioneer Homes Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlFor these reasons  I am satisfied that I should order a hearing under O   r   that the separate questions be heard before the rest of the proceedings  In my opinion  the questions of construction and  if possible  power should be decided by a Full Court exercising the original jurisdiction so that  the balance of the proceedings can be tried more efficiently and expeditiously  I propose to reserve the separate questions for hearing by a Full Court pursuant to s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   The power of a single judge sitting in the Court s original jurisdiction to reserve a question for consideration by a Full Court can only be exercised in a matter where an appeal would lie to a Full Court  s    An appeal  by leave  from an order answering the separate questions  would lie to a Full Court under s   and  A  of the Federal Court of Australia Act   Therefore  under s   of the Act  a single judge has power to reserve for consideration and determination by a Full Court  those questions and the question of whether any amendment or addition to those questions is necessary and  if so ought be made  so as to enable the Full Court to determine the proper construction of cll     and   of the deed and their validity  Henderson v Pioneer Homes Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     per Stephen  Mason and Wilson JJ  There is an important public interest in the prompt determination of these proceedings so that the administrators and the creditors know their positions  particularly if the deed is invalid or the impugned provisions are found to be void or are varied  In addition  the administration of Lehman companies in other jurisdictions and the positions of insurers may be affected by the final decision of this Court  Answers to these questions will provide a suitable means of moving more promptly and efficiently to the final resolution of this complex matter  The parties should prepare an agreed bundle of documents constituting the factual matrix together with the deed and prepare a timetable for submissions  I will direct the parties to bring in

deed  as well as evidence that would support its rectification claim  It did not elaborate how this evidence could go beyond the evidence of the factual matrix on which the parties to the proceedings may rely on issues of construction  in order to establish the relevant common intention of the parties  being the creditors  including Lehman Asia  Lehman Australia and the administrators  cf Pukallus v Cameron   HCA         CLR   per Wilson J at   with whom Gibbs CJ agreed at   per Brennan J at    Lehman Bros argued that if the questions were answered favourably to the plaintiffs then one of two results followed  either the deed was not a deed of company arrangement and fell outside the scope of Pt    A or  it fell within the scope of the Part but was void  In the latter case remedial options in Pt    A were available and there would be substantial arguments that the Court should exercise a discretion to give effect to the wish of the majority of creditors by value and number voting at the meetings  On the other hand  Lehman Bros accepted that if the plaintiffs were correct and the Court could not make any orders remedying the deed  it would seek termination of the deed  as well as the plaintiffs  since its rights were prejudiced  Lehman Bros argued that it had only agreed to subordinate its debt in the proposed arrangement in order to obtain the releases citedRoyal Botanic Gardens

dissenting judgment that the attractions of trials of issues rather than of cases in their totality are often more chimerical than real  They noted that common experience demonstrated that saving in time and expense were often illusory  particularly when they overlapped within parties  preparation for other factual matters  They said that a party might feel aggrieved if their case were knocked out on the trial of a preliminary or single issue  and might suspect that the abbreviated course had been adopted to meet the court s  rather than the parties  interests  And they noted that there was a potential for further appeals  particularly if the separate issue having been decided one way initially were reversed on appeal and the matter sent back for a full trial of the whole of the issues

distinguishedWoolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlLehman Bros argued that a number of judgments tended to suggest that  in analogous statutory contexts  courts had allowed companies involved in re organisations or arrangements to stipulate that their creditors give releases to third parties  Lehman Bros argued that it will be necessary to consider the whole factual context in order to be able to come to a conclusion about whether  in the circumstances established at a trial  the impugned provisions could have been included in the deed  It referred to the caution expressed about separate questions by Gleeson CJ  Gummow  Hayne and Heydon JJ in Woolcock Street Investments Pty Ltd v CDG Pty Ltd   HCA         CLR   at         noting that those remarks were made where all the parties had agreed to the use of the separate question  unlike the present case  Lehman Bros argued that there may be relevant facts  such as the existence of joint or joint and several liability on the part of one or more of the Lehman companies with Lehman Australia  that could affect how the Court would determine the extent of the power under Pt    A to authorise the making of a deed to bind creditors in respect of their rights against third parties  Lehman Bros argued that because of the need to have regard to a variety of potential factual contexts  it was impractical to order a separation of issues concerning the ambit of the power in Pt    A for a deed to bind creditors  in the absence of the full context of all of the circumstances  It contended that it wished to advance evidence to show a connection between  and justifying  the exercise of the power to make the impugned clauses and the circumstances of the case  Lehman Bros argued that that would involve a factual investigation into the degree of connection between the impugned provisions and the source of power in Pt    A   not suitable for investigation in a separate question  It also contended that evidence could support the inclusion of the impugned provisions in relation to potential claims for contribution or indemnity that it or other Lehman entities might have against Lehman Australia were they sued by one of the plaintiffs or another dissenting creditor  The plaintiffs emphasised in reply that the only beneficiaries of the wider release in cl     were Lehman companies  They contended that the separate questions still had utility  They argued that the issue whether there was power under Pt    A to give effect to the impugned clauses in the deed should be determined on the basis that if the Court came to the conclusion that further evidence than the deed itself and the relevant matrix of fact in which the creditors  meeting came to resolve that it be executed could affect the outcome  then those questions should not be answered  Nonetheless  the plaintiffs argued that the issue of power under Pt    A was a stark one and that the questions were capable of receiving an affirmative answer  They argued that if there were no power  the onus to demonstrate that there was no prejudice would then be on any defendants who sought to uphold a validation of the deed or its amendment under the provisions in Pt    A of the Act on which they had relied  In Woolcock Street   CLR at       Gleeson CJ  Gummow
