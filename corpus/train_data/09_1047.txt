Watson v AWB Limited  No     FCA     September  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedAlister v The Queen     CLR  Where an objection to the production of documents in answer to a subpoena is based upon a claim of public interest immunity  the usual practice established many years ago has been for the grounds of the claim to be set out and explained in an affidavit made by either the Minister who is the political head of the particular department concerned or the Secretary of that department   Sankey v Whitlam   HCA         CLR   at    The weight to be afforded to that affidavit is governed to some degree by the extent of the knowledge which the deponent possesses concerning the documents which are the subject of the claim   Sankey v Whitlam   CLR at    The knowledge of those documents which must be considered comprises not only knowledge of the contents of the documents but also knowledge of the circumstances in which they came into existence  When the claim is based partly or wholly on national security grounds  very considerable weight must be given to the views of the responsible Minister or the permanent head  In the present case  because we live in dangerous times and matters of national security are at the forefront of the ONA s responsibilities  very considerable weight must be given to the views of the Director General expressed  as they were  on his oath   Alister v The Queen     CLR   at    Claims of public interest immunity require the Court to decide whether the administration of justice will be impaired or perhaps even frustrated by the withholding of relevant evidence in favour of a greater public interest  namely  that harm shall not be done to the nation or the Public Service by the disclosure of the material in

v Northern Land Council   HCA         CLR   at     citedAttorney General  NSW  v Chidgey     A Crim R  It seems to me that it is sufficiently  on the cards  that there may be something in the   redacted reports shown to Mr Cole which  either alone or in combination with other evidence  might advance the case which AWB seeks to put in answer to the allegations made against it by the applicants in the present proceedings in pars    a  and   of the Second Further Amended Statement of Claim  The  on the cards  test is explained by the NSW Court of Appeal in Attorney General  NSW  v Chidgey     A Crim R   at      However  given that the remaining   reports were read and considered by lawyers assisting the Cole Inquiry and not thought by them to be of sufficient relevance and importance to be passed on to the Commissioner himself for his consideration and given the clear evidence of the Director General set out in pars   and   of his affidavit sworn on   August    which I have extracted in full at   above  I do not think that it can fairly be said that it is  on the cards  that there will be information and material in the remaining   reports which might advance AWB s case in defence of the allegations made in pars    a  and   of the Statement of Claim  Accordingly  in my view  AWB has failed to demonstrate that the   reports not seen by Mr Cole are or may be of sufficient importance to its case that the Court should undertake the exercise of balancing the public interest in withholding production against the public interest in the administration of justice

classified Secret   These classifications significantly restrict access to those documents within the Government and prevent disclosure outside Government circles  Many of the documents carry other classifications which cannot themselves be disclosed  Three grounds of substance are advanced by the ONA in support of its claim for public interest immunity  These are   a  Disclosure of the contents of the   reports would prejudice Australia s national security   b  Disclosure would damage our relations with other countries  and  c  Disclosure would enable interested parties to conduct what is called in the intelligence community  a mosaic analysis   which might lead to an accurate picture of a relevant state of affairs being conveyed accidentally because an informed and interested reader of disparate pieces of information may be able to piece together a picture which would not readily present itself to less informed and less interested persons  Ground  a  Prejudice to National Security The Director General testified that disclosure of any part of the   reports would Claims of public interest immunity require the Court to decide whether the administration of justice will be

Director General expressed  as they were  on his oath   Alister v The Queen     CLR   at    The Director General of the ONA has read all of the   reports  He has also read the confidential affidavits  one  as sworn  and the other in final draft form  but not yet sworn   It is apparent from the terms of his affidavits that the Director General has also relied upon information conveyed to him by his staff as to the circumstances in which the Cole distillation came into existence  It is generally to be expected in cases such as the present that the relevant deponent will testify that he has read all of the documents for which the immunity is claimed   Sankey v Whitlam   CLR at       and    The deponent will also need to explain why the disclosure of the documents is detrimental to the proper functioning of the Executive Government and of the Public Service  if appropriate   At   above  I have summarised the bases upon which the ONA seeks to claim public interest immunity in respect of the   reports and the distribution lists  Claims of public interest immunity require the Court to decide whether the administration of justice will be impaired or perhaps even frustrated by the

materials in question would contain evidence for tender at trial  The Council denied there was any such requirement imposed upon it  We agree there is no requirement in the terms contended for by the Commonwealth  Counsel for AWB submitted that  given that the Cole distillation was in the public domain  it was unreal for the ONA to press its claim for public interest immunity in respect of these documents  It is not a question of waiver  for public interest immunity cannot be waived  However  once the contents or the substance of the contents of a document have been disclosed  there is no longer any reason to deny to the Court access to that document if it provides evidence that is relevant and otherwise admissible   Sankey v Whitlam   CLR at    The public interest in non disclosure would either be much reduced or destroyed by the prior publication of the contents of the document   Sankey v Whitlam   CLR at    The only argument or ground advanced by the ONA which might survive the fact that the Cole distillation has been made public is the argument advanced under the heading  mosaic analysis   I do not think that the other two grounds advanced by the ONA now have much weight in light of the fact that the substance of the   redacted reports was disclosed to the public at large in the Cole distillation  Any angst felt by Australia s foreign intelligence partners will not be as great as it was in   and  given the way in which the Cole distillation was compiled  there is little chance that production to the Court of the   redacted reports and the distribution lists relevant to those reports will harm national security  The ONA submitted that  notwithstanding the publication of the Cole distillation  the revelation of the actual contents of the redacted   reports shown to Mr Cole may well lead to a mosaic analysis being carried out by undesirables  thus threatening Australia s security and its national interests in the manner adumbrated by the Director General of the ONA and by the deponents of the confidential affidavits  I do not accept this submission at the moment  Production to the Court for the purposes of inspection and further consideration of the ONA s claims cannot have the effect suggested by the ONA  Nor do I accept that I should further limit production by reference to a shorter period of time than that covered by the   reports
