Orix Australia Corporation Limited v Crouch   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toBaker v Campbell   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Legal professional privilege is confined to professional communications made on a confidential basis for legal advice and services  The concept of legal privilege is founded on the special significance that the Court attaches to the informed resolution of disputes in the court system and the application of the law to those disputes  In consequence  the communications which arise from that professional relationship are given special significance  see  for instance  Baker v Campbell   HCA         CLR   at   for a discussion of the rationale underlying the privilege  In essence  the purpose of legal privilege is to facilitate the giving of advice in the conduct of adversarial litigation to ensure that there is open communication between clients and legal advisers   I consider that Documents     inclusive are privileged for the above reasons   Document   is an affidavit by a son of the bankrupt whose only involvement in the bankruptcy of his parents was that he filed an initial debtor s petition in the estate of his father  which was subsequently set aside  I consider the same principles apply to this document as to the preceding documents
