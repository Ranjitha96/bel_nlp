Gleeson CJ  McHugh  Gummow  Hayne and Callinan JJ acknowledged the width of the powers conferred by s  A  Their Honours made the following general propositions about its operation         Section  A is not properly described as a general power standing apart from Pt    A  It is an integral part of the legislative scheme for which that Part provides  In particular it can apply to alter timetables prescribed by other provisions of Pt    A  at          The words of s  A do not suggest that it cannot be used if  by operation of the provisions of Pt    A   the administration of the relevant company has come to an end  The section deals with a  particular company  and the operation of Pt    A in relation to it  at          The words of the section  how this Part is to operate  look to the future but do not preclude the making of orders with future effect but in respect of past matters or events   at          In connection with the effect of an order under s  A on accrued or vested rights  two types of case may arise following termination of an administration         i  Steps are taken by members or officers of the company or by third parties predicated upon termination of the administration other than by entering a deed of company arrangement or going into liquidation eg shares in the company are traded  directors resume the management of the company and deal with its assets or take other like steps on the assumption that the administration is at an end and there is neither a deed of company arrangement nor a winding up    ii  Steps are taken that are predicated upon the company having validly entered a deed of company arrangement or gone into liquidation  at          To the extent that any steps have been taken following the termination of the Deed in this case and the winding up resolution  they fall into the second category of case identified by the High Court  The court left open the question whether there is power to make an order under s  A in the first case where the administration has ended  at      In the second kind of case however             there would be no inconsistency between the varied operation of Pt    A and the rights that have accrued in the intervening period  if the order gave legal validity to the premise for the parties  conduct      It may be accepted that in this case there is a possibility  however small  that accrued rights may be affected by an order terminating the winding up  setting aside the termination of the Deed and giving effect to the proposed variation  Under that variation however  the Deed is to be terminated in any event after its conditions have been fulfilled  There is no suggestion of any third party dealings which could be adversely affected by the orders proposed  In any event  they can be accommodated by liberty to apply  limited in time  to vary the orders made to ensure the protection of any accrued right   I am satisfied that I can set aside the termination of the Deed on the basis that the order operates prospectively  The order setting aside the termination will take effect so that the rights and obligations of all parties will be determined as though the Deed continued in effect from the meeting of creditors and had not been terminated  To the extent that there may be any particular direction necessary to take account of any rights or obligations that have accrued since the Deed was terminated  there will be liberty to apply within the next   days for a suitable qualifying order  Given that all creditors have been given notice and none has expressed an objection  I regard the probability of such an application as small  but nevertheless will allow such an application within that time citedRe Pasminco Ltd  No       ACSR   As to the variation of the Deed there is no doubt that the Court has power to order a variation  The power of the Court to make such an order was considered by Finkelstein J in Re  Pasminco Ltd  No       ACSR    In that case his Honour said  at      The Corporations Act contemplates that a deed of company arrangement may be varied by creditors at a meeting convened under s  F  The administrators  however  wish to short cut this procedure and have the deed varied by an order made under s  A  In Milankov Nominees Pty Ltd v Roycol Ltd     FCR     Lee J suggested that this could be done  In two decisions in the following year Branson J expressly found the power to exist  The decisions are Re Giga Investments Pty Ltd  Admin Apptd   No       ACLC     and Mulvaney v Rob Wintulich Pty Ltd     FCR      Many cases have followed these decisions  On the basis of these authorities I am satisfied that the power to make variation exists   In my opinion in this case the variation order sought ought to be made  It appears on the face of it to offer some benefit to creditors  None object  and there is the possibility  although it does not seem great  that Messrs  Forrest and Richardson may be able to revive the company s fortunes  I will therefore make the variation order but in prospective terms rather than the apparently retrospective terms sought by the applicants   For the preceding reasons I will terminate the winding up of Euco  set aside the termination of the Deed and direct that it be varied in accordance with the proposal submitted to the creditors  meeting of   March    I will require notice to be given to all creditors of these orders and allow liberty to apply within   days for any variation of the order setting aside the termination of the Deed to the extent that it may impinge upon accrued rights     I certify that the preceding forty three   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French   Associate Dated    July
