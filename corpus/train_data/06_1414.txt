institution is its constitution or articles of association  However  this will not always be determinative since  t he skill of Chancery draftsmen is well able to produce a constitution of charitable flavour intended to allow the pursuit of aims of a non charitable or dubiously charitable flavour  Attorney General v Ross     WLR   at   per Scott J  Similarly  the constitution of a legitimate charity may be drafted in such a way as to obscure that legitimacy  whether through the inexperience of the drafter  the mistaken belief that the organisation s charitable nature will never be questioned  or otherwise  Where it is unclear from the listed objects of an organisation what its main purpose is  or where the evidence shows that the listed objects do not reflect the actual purpose of the organisation  it is appropriate to look to the activities of the organisation together with the expressed objects  In my view  this is not a case where the listed objects leave it unclear what is the main purpose of the organisation  Nor is there evidence that the stated objects do not reflect the actual purpose of Word  The first six objects in paragraph  a  of the objects  set out above at   are clearly related to Word s evangelising activities  As for the remaining objects  I am satisfied  as was the Tribunal  that their comprehensive nature is more likely to reflect a degree of caution on the part of the drafter to ensure that no necessary or desirable act would be prohibited because of an unintended omission from the list   The Tribunal s finding in respect of the period from   or   to the establishment of Bethel Funerals in   was as follows     Between   or   and   the sole activity of the applicant was the generation of income from interest earned on deposits from individuals seeking to support those fund raising activities  Its constituent documents prohibited distribution to members of the company and the income generated was applied solely for the benefits of  Wycliffe  as the primary recipient with small contributions to other similar religious organisations  It pursued those objectives solely in Australia and  as such  satisfied the requirements of Item     of s     and s    a  of the Act and was entitled to be endorsed as exempt from income tax for that period as an institution for the advancement of religion   This finding raises three questions of law which the Commissioner says  for the purposes of the period from   were answered erroneously by the Tribunal  The first is the Commissioner s submission that there was insufficient evidence for the Tribunal to conclude that the payments made by Word to Wycliffe and other organisations were used by them for charitable purposes  No such conclusion expressly appears in the Tribunal s reasons but I agree with the Commissioner s submission that that is the only basis on which the Tribunal could have concluded that Word s activities were charitable appliedCollins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALR   In Collins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs     ALR   Fox  Deane and Morling JJ said  at      An appellant who attacks a conclusion of the Tribunal because of deficiency of proof said to amount to an error of law must show  if he is to succeed  that there was no material before the Tribunal upon which the conclusion could properly be based      Clearly  in this case there was evidence that Wycliffe and the other organisations used the money received from Word for charitable purposes  More importantly  there was also evidence that Word intended and believed that Wycliffe and the other organisations would use the money for charitable purposes  It follows that no error of law has been made out consideredIncorporated Council of Law Reporting for England and Wales v Attorney General   Ch   The second question of law that arises from the Tribunal s findings in respect of this period is whether the generation of income from interest earned on deposits is a sufficiently religious activity to establish Word as a charity  Word relied on a number of cases in support of its contention that fund raising may be part of a charitable purpose  With one exception  I have not found these authorities to be of great assistance  The exception is Incorporated Council of Law Reporting for England and Wales v Attorney General   Ch    In that case  the Council was a not for profit organisation that published reports of judicial decisions  It was entitled to and did charge for its services but was prohibited from distributing profits to its members  The Commissioners of Inland Revenue argued that the purpose of the Council was to carry on the trade of publishers and sellers of law reports and that this was not a charitable purpose  They said that no legal distinction could be drawn between the Council and a similar publisher that profited from its publishing and selling law reports  The Court of Appeal rejected this argument  Russell LJ said  at      The fact that the association carries on a trade or business is admittedly not inconsistent with a charitable character in its objects  The difference between the two cases is in my view a vital distinction  The element of unselfishness is well recognised as an aspect of charity  and an important one  Suppose on the one hand a company which publishes the Bible for the profit of its directors and shareholders  plainly the company would not be established for charitable purposes  But suppose an association or company which is non profit making  whose members or directors are forbidden to benefit from its activities  and whose object is to publish the Bible  equally plainly it would seem to me that the main object of the association or company would be charitable the advancement or promotion of religion   In the same case  Sachs LJ said at   that     it is clear that the mere fact that charges on a commercial scale are made for services rendered by an institution does not of itself bar that institution from being held to be charitable so long  at any rate  as all the profits must be retained for its purposes and none can enure to the benefit of its individual members    It is clear from the passages from the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting case and the Scottish Burial case that the key to determining charitable status is motive  An investigation of motive cannot be conducted without considering the ultimate object of an organisation s activities  It follows that Word is right to argue that Wycliffe s activities are relevant to whether Word is entitled to charitable status  I also accept the corollary  namely that the location of Wycliffe s activities is also relevant consideredScottish Burial Reform and Cremation Society Ltd v Glasgow Corporation   UKHL       AC   A case with some similarity to the present is Scottish Burial Reform and Cremation Society Ltd v Glasgow Corporation   UKHL       AC    In that case the Society carried on a crematorium for which fees were charged  The fees were not distributed to members and were re invested in the Society  It was held that the provision of cremation services was a charity for public benefit  It was argued against the Society that the charging of a fee for the cremation services meant that their provision could not be charitable  Lord Reid  with whom Lord Guest agreed  said  at        I t has never been held that objects  otherwise charitable  cease to be charitable if beneficiaries are required to make payments for what they receive  It may even be that public demand for the kind of service which the charity provides becomes so large that there is room for a commercial undertaking to come in and supply similar services on a commercial basis  But no authority and no reason has been put forward for holding that when that stage is reached the objects and activities or the non profit earning charitable organisation cease to be charitable         See also at   per Lord Upjohn and at     per Lord Wilberforce  Lord Pearson  at   concurred   While these cases are of assistance to Word  they do not entirely answer the question  The proposition for which they stand is that where an organisation engages in an activity that has a charitable purpose  that purpose will not be lost where a profit is made in conducting that activity  provided that the profit is not distributed to members and is used exclusively  save for allowable incidental purposes  for charitable purposes  They do not address the question whether an activity that is not in itself charitable  but that is conducted for the purpose of producing income to be used for a charitable purpose  may itself be charitable   Nonetheless  I think it is clear from the above passages that the making of a profit through trade or business is not necessarily inconsistent with a charitable purpose and that the true question to be asked is the purpose of the making of the profit  If the purpose is commercial then the exclusive purpose of the organisation is not charitable  if the purpose is selfless then it may be  Prior to   the sole profit making activity engaged in by Word was the investment of moneys provided by public investors who shared Word s beliefs and aims  The profits thereby made were then provided to Wycliffe and similar organisations  If  consistent with my understanding of the passages cited above  the true focus of the enquiry is on the purpose and not the manner of the profit making  then it is clear that Word s purposes were  up to   and subject to the second matter which I will come to shortly  charitable   It is clear from the passages from the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting case and the Scottish Burial case that the key to determining charitable status is motive  An investigation of motive cannot be conducted without considering the ultimate object of an organisation s activities  It follows that Word is right to argue that Wycliffe s activities are relevant to whether Word is entitled to charitable status  I also accept the corollary  namely that the location of Wycliffe s activities is also relevant citedRyde Municipal

with this approach  It accords with the thrust of the decisions I have cited at     distinguishedRoman Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne v Lawlor   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The Commissioner argued that  consistently with the judgment of Dixon J in Roman Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne v Lawlor   HCA         CLR   it is necessary to draw a distinction between purposes of religion and things conducive to the good of religion  He characterised the generation of funds and distribution of those funds to Wycliffe as possibly being conducive to the good of religion  but as not being for the purposes of religion  The distinction is derived from the decision of the Privy Council in Dunne v Byrne   AC   where it was held that an activity may be conducive to the good of religion but not itself be charitable  An example  taken from the judgment of Griffith CJ in the High Court in the same case     HCA       CLR   is of advances made to government bodies for the purposes of obtaining funding to be used for religious purposes  Such advances would not themselves be for the purpose of religion although they might be conducive to the good of religion   I do not think the distinction referred to by Dixon J in Lawlor assists the Commissioner  It is clearly directed at the difference between activities that have a direct religious purpose and other activities that are incidental and beneficial to the religious purpose but are not themselves directly religious in purpose  The distinction that the Commissioner really calls for is one between an activity that is clearly religious in purpose and that  on the one hand  is conducted by the taxpayer itself and  on the other hand  is conducted through an intermediary such as Word  That is a wholly artificial distinction  The charitable purpose of an activity cannot depend on whether it is conducted from start to finish by one entity or whether two or more entities with different skills join together to jointly conduct it  The Commissioner s argument is inconsistent with the corporate structure of many contemporary charities which are complex and involve the use of separate legal entities to perform separate functions  Where they are all working together to pursue a common  charitable purpose it is artificial to consider the purpose of each entity separately   The final question of law which the Commissioner contends was wrongly answered by the Tribunal in the paragraph cited above at   concerns the place where Word conducted its business  It will be remembered that s     of the Act requires a charitable institution to satisfy one of four alternative tests  one of which  paragraph  a  is that the institution  has a physical presence in Australia and  to that extent  incurs its expenditure and pursues its objectives principally in Australia    The Tribunal held that Word satisfied this test  It is not suggested that Word could satisfy any of the other tests in s       Paragraph  a  of s     is curiously drafted  It requires three tests to be met   a  that the institution has a physical presence in Australia   b  that the institution incurs its expenditure principally in Australia  and  c  that the institution pursues its objectives principally in Australia  Each of these tests is  of itself  relatively straightforward to apply  The difficulty is the words  to that extent  that connect requirement  a  to requirements  b  and  c   The words appear to cover the situation of an institution that has a presence both in Australia and elsewhere  In such a case  it seems that the institution is only required to incur its Australian expenditure principally in Australia and pursue its Australian objectives principally in Australia  In other words  were an institution to have an office in Australia and a similar office in New Zealand  and the expenditure of the Australian office was incurred principally in Australia and the objectives of the Australian office were pursued principally in Australia  then the fact that the New Zealand office may incur expenditure and pursue objectives principally in a place that is not Australia  does not disqualify the institution from satisfying the paragraph distinguishedGlebe Administration Board v Commissioner of Pay roll Tax     NSWLR   The Tribunal found that  it is difficult to consider a commercial funeral business as having an objective of the advancement of religion  and that  the business was a commercial operation for the purpose of making a commercial profit    The Tribunal relied on the decision of Priestley JA  with whom McHugh JA agreed  in Glebe Administration Board v Commissioner of Pay roll Tax     NSWLR   where his Honour said  at      In my opinion the Board was not at any relevant time a religious institution  It was a statutory corporation doing commercial work within limitations fixed by reference to religious principles  It was staffed by persons who wished to observe the religious principles giving rise to the limitations on the Board s commercial activities  The property in its ownership both increased in value and gave rise to revenue  Capital was held for the benefit of a religious institution and large amounts of revenue were handed over to that institution  To my mind all these matters result in it being accurate to describe the Board as a legal entity working in a commercial area  guiding its commercial conduct by the principles of a religious institution and  in ordinary language  working for that religious institution  I do not think that this legal entity can either by an ordinary or a technical use of language be accurately called a religious institution   This case does not aid the Commissioner  Its facts are distinguishable from the present case  It concerned a statutory body exercising property ownership and investment powers given to it by statute  The Board was required by statute to hold and invest church property and to deal with any proceeds  Its purposes were thus defined by statute  This is to be contrasted with Word  which is an independent organisation which has chosen to apply funds that it raises to Wycliffe and other religious bodies  The Board s manner of operation was also different from Word s  It lent money for short terms at commercial interest rates and applied funds for church activities generally  rather than the specific activities supported by Word  Finally  the Board claimed to be a religious institution not  as in the present case  a charitable institution  Word concedes that it cannot be a religious institution   In my view  in concluding that the running of a funeral business could not advance religion  the Tribunal fell into two errors  The first was to consider the funeral business in isolation from the remainder of Word s operations  There was no evidence to suggest that  from the commencement of Bethel Funerals  Word ceased receiving money from investors  The entity claiming to be a charitable organisation is Word  not the Bethel Funerals operations of Word  Word s activities as a whole must be considered when determining whether its purposes were charitable   When such a consideration is undertaken  the second error becomes clear  Word s purposes as a whole were to raise money for provision to Wycliffe and similar organisations  This was true both before and after the establishment of Bethel Funerals  It was only the manner of raising the money that changed  the purpose for doing it remained the same  The Tribunal s error appears to have involved drawing an unwarranted distinction between active and passive investment  It seems to have assumed that it may be charitable for an organisation to receive funds from investors who may or may not have been encouraged to support its goals and ideals  but that it cannot be charitable for the organisation to actively establish a business to derive similar income   The Tribunal s distinction is at odds with the practice of contemporary charitable organisations  With the decline of the welfare state  charitable organisations are expected to do more with the same resources  Reliance on donations alone will  in many cases  be insufficient  Hence many charitable organisations have established business ventures to generate the income necessary to support their activities  There may appear to be a vast difference between selling lamingtons at a church f te and selling funeral services  but where the object of raising the funds is the same  I can no see no reason to draw a legal distinction between the two  I again refer in this connection to the cases referred to at       It follows that  for the period from   July   to   July   Word was a charitable institution under item     of the table at s     of the Act and is entitled to endorsement accordingly  The cross appeal is therefore allowed  Word s alternative argument that its articles and memorandum of association created an instrument of trust need not be considered   As set out above at   Word established the Foundation from   July   to carry on the business of Bethel Funerals  This effected a significant change from the position prior to that date  when Bethel Funerals was merely a part of Word rather than run through a separate legal entity  The Tribunal held that  the activities after   July   being the same as those prior to   entitle  Word  to endorsement as a charitable institution from that date  appliedFletcher v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   Section   of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act   provides that  for the purposes of reviewing an administrative decision  the Tribunal may exercise all the powers and discretions that are conferred on the original decision maker  In Fletcher v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   at   Lockhart  Wilcox and Burchett JJ said  referring to s        In exercising those powers and discretions the Tribunal was bound to consider the facts as they were proved in evidence before the Tribunal  making the decision which  upon that evidence and at that time  was the correct or preferable decision to be made in considering the objection  The Tribunal was not confined either to the material which was before the Commissioner  as primary decision maker  or the events which had occurred up to that time      It follows that not only was the period from   July   before the Tribunal  but indeed the Tribunal was obliged to consider that period   Thirdly  the Commissioner says that the evidence before the Tribunal was insufficient to establish the finding that the activities of Word from   July   were the same as those prior to    The Commissioner points to the relative paucity of material in evidence for the period from   July    I accept that if the only question for the Tribunal had been Word s operations from   July   and there had been no evidence of its operations prior to then  the Tribunal would have had difficulty reaching a view on whether Word qualified for charitable status  However  this was not the situation  Word s case was that the only significant change in its operations from the period immediately prior to the establishment of Bethel Funerals in   to the termination of its activities in   was the existence and operations of Bethel Funerals  A taxpayer that seeks to establish that it is a charity is not required to prove that status on every single day in the period for which it claims that status  Once it has established that it is a charity at a particular time  it is entitled to rely on that finding until such time as it is proved that its activities have changed to the extent that it is no longer charitable  The Commissioner has not pointed to any additional changes to Word s operations from   July    He did not seek to cross examine Word s witnesses on its activities from   July    In these circumstances  there was evidence before the Tribunal that entitled it to find that Word s operations from   July   were the same as those prior to
