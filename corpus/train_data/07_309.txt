the applicant s trademarks and  as they had failed to establish any arguable defence  the applicant was entitled to summary judgment against them  Further  the third and fourth respondents admitted  in essence  that they had infringed the applicant s trademarks  The Court made orders accordingly referred toNokia Corporation v Cellular Line Australia Pty Ltd  No     FCA  http www austlii edu au au

after   February     At a directions hearing on   December   the Court gave the applicant leave to discontinue against the first respondent  on the basis that the applicant s costs be taxed and paid forthwith  Further  the Court ordered  by consent  that the proceeding be discontinued as against the fourth respondent  and that the fourth respondent pay the applicant costs and damages in the

discontinued against the third respondent  subject to the resolution of the question of costs  I stated that  in the circumstances  my preferred course was to fix these costs  a course to which the

a gross sum instead of taxed costs  see also s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   I consider it appropriate to fix costs because of the patent undesirability of continuing the litigation between the applicant and the third respondent  The Court may make an order fixing costs  even though earlier costs orders in the proceeding contemplated taxation in the ordinary way  see Beach Petroleum NL v Johnson  No       FCR   at   per von Doussa J   Beach Petroleum     Naturally enough  the Court s discretion to fix costs must be exercised judicially and by reference to principle  In setting a gross fee  the Court must be  confident that the approach taken to estimate costs is logical  fair and reasonable  see Beach Petroleum at    As Von Doussa J said in Beach Petroleum at

an arbitrary  fail safe  discount on the costs estimates submitted to the Court      His Honour held  at   that the starting point for fixing costs must be the charges rendered by the applicant s solicitors  although in a complex bill there are likely to be items taxed off and there may well be occasions in which a judge will make a discount  For example  in Canvas Graphics Pty Ltd v Kodak  Australasia  Pty Ltd   FCA     O Loughlin J held that the sum of costs fixed should be proportionate to the nature  including the complexity  of the case  and  that in a case involving a relatively simple cause of action  it was necessary to keep a firm control on costs  which should not be permitted  to explode  citedCanvas Graphics Pty Ltd v Kodak  Australasia  Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii
