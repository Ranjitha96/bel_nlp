SZKRL v Minister for Citizenship   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedMinister for Immigration   Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  His Honour found that these grounds effectively invited the Court to undertake a review of the merits of the appellant s application and  to make findings on her claim different from the findings which were made by the Tribunal   His Honour found correctly that the Court could not engage in merits review and that findings of fact were uniquely within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal  SZKRL at     see Minister for Immigration   Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR   at    No error is disclosed in his Honour s finding that the grounds pleaded by the appellant in her application failed to demonstrate any jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal   His Honour noted further that at the hearing before him the appellant also raised an allegation that the Tribunal s finding  was not reasonable  because she was a genuine Falun Gong practitioner  SZKRL at    His Honour found that this ground effectively amounted to the appellant expressing  emphatic disagreement with the Tribunal s findings and decision   His Honour found that such a complaint again invited impermissible merits review and could not succeed  For the reasons outlined at   above  no error is apparent in this approach   To the extent that the ground sought to allege that  there was some illogicality or irrationality in the Tribunal s decision  his Honour found that there was no proper basis for such an allegation  His Honour found that the basis of the Tribunal s decision was  clear   reasoned  and was  open to it on the evidence before it  and that no jurisdictional error was disclosed  SZKRL at       Accordingly  his Honour found that no jurisdictional error had been demonstrated on the part of the Tribunal and dismissed the application with costs  SZKRL at     The appellant was required to file and serve a notice of appeal within   days from the date the judgment appealed from was pronounced  Order   rule   of the Federal Court Rules    the Rules   His Honour delivered ex tempore reasons for judgment at the conclusion of the hearing on   October    Accordingly  the appellant had to file and serve a notice of appeal on or before   November    Instead  she filed an application for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal on   November   some   days outside the prescribed appeal period   The appellant has not advanced any explanation or any evidence for her inability to file a notice of appeal by   November    In her affidavit sworn on   November   and filed on   November   in support of her application for an extension of time  the appellant simply restates her factual claims for refugee status and asserts that she disagrees with the decision of the Tribunal and that the  RRT did not consider I am genuine Falun Gong Practitioner   These matters amount to impermissible merits review and do not advance the appellant s case in any meaningful sense  Wu Shan Liang   ibid  NAHI v Minister for Immigration   Multicultural Affairs   FCAFC   citedJess v Scott     FCR   The appellant now seeks an order pursuant to O   r   of the Rules  which provides that the Court or a Judge for  special reasons may at any time give leave to file and serve a notice of appeal   Accordingly  O   r   imposes a requirement that  special reasons  exist  as to the nature of the power and what is meant by  special reasons  see  Jess v Scott     FCR   at     per Lockhart  Sheppard and Burchett JJ  and even if that condition is fulfilled  it leaves a discretion to grant or refuse leave to appeal
