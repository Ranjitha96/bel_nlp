Green v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAustralian Capital Territory v Alphaone Pty Ltd     FCR   In my view  there was no obligation on the part of Tribunal to inform Mr Green of its views regarding his credibility and the weight which it was prepared to give his evidence  The Tribunal s conclusion as to his credibility was part of its reasoning and thought processes in relation to the determination of the whole matter  and thus was not required to be put to Mr Green  see Commissioner for the Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd     FCR   at      Although it was for the Tribunal to weigh Mr Green s evidence and in so doing form a view as to his credibility  the reasoning involved in this task did not need to be signalled   Secondly  it is said that the Tribunal ought to have sought further evidence from persons who made statements but were not called to give oral evidence  The Tribunal observed in its reasons at   that     It was notable that none of the people most closely involved with the applicant his father  his son  his step mother  his sister and his de facto gave evidence at the hearing   His son  and  his de facto  apparently attended the hearing  however   There was no requirement  in my view  that the Tribunal seek further evidence from these persons  If Mr Green wished to adduce evidence from these persons  he had a full opportunity to do so  Given that Mr Green chose not to call them  it is not appropriate to expect the Tribunal to seek any further evidence on the basis that they may be able to provide some useful information consideredJones v Dunkel   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Although the observation of the Tribunal at   concerning Mr Green s failure to call certain witnesses could be construed adversely to Mr Green s case  there is no indication that those persons could have provided material to assist his case  On the other hand  however  having regard to the fact that the Tribunal s proceedings are inquisitorial in nature and the observations in Jones v Dunkel   HCA         CLR   at   are not applicable  there is no indication in this case that any particular adverse inference was drawn or suggested on the basis of the fact that the witnesses did not give evidence orally and that the omission to ask them to do so rested with Mr Green  and not on the Tribunal    Finally  it is said that there were three findings of fact made by the Tribunal for which there was no evidentiary basis  This submission relies on an interpretation of the Tribunal s reasons at      The applicant has an aunt  his father s sister  in England  though he says he does not remember her  While his aunt could not necessarily be expected to welcome the applicant into her home  it is not improbable that she would be able to give him some guidance on becoming re established in the United Kingdom  The skills he has developed as a painter would be as useful to him there as they are here  and indeed the larger market might be to his advantage  He has no business ties within Australia  Nothing in the evidence suggests that he would be unable to obtain  the drug facilitating his rehabilitation  in the United Kingdom and thereby continue his drug rehabilitation   When closely examined  it is apparent that each of the views expressed by the Tribunal at   is in tentative and speculative terms and that they are not expressed as findings of fact  The general effect of the observations is that there is simply no evidence to support findings to the contrary  So far as the observation in relation to Mr Green s aunt is concerned  this is a general statement which does not appear to have been given any particular weight  The statements in this paragraph really amount on their face to an expression of views which were open to the Tribunal in the circumstances of this case   I therefore do not consider that there was any failure by the Tribunal to provide procedural fairness in this case   For the reasons which I have given above in relation to the need to consider mitigating factors pursuant to paragraph     of the Direction  this application is granted and the matter is remitted to the Tribunal for determination in accordance with these reasons  As the second respondent filed a submitting appearance  it is appropriate that the costs of the application are borne by the first respondent   I certify that the preceding forty five   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the

edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  Section   of the Act provides that the Minister may give written directions to a person or body having functions or powers under the Act if the directions are about the performance of those functions or the exercise of those powers  Section  A  mandates that the relevant person or body  which includes the Tribunal  see Rokobatini v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR   at    per Katz J  must comply with such a direction  The power of the Minister under s   is limited by s   which provides that a direction must be consistent with the Act and regulations promulgated pursuant to it   On   August   pursuant to s   the Minister issued Direction No   entitled Visa Refusal and Cancellation under section    the Direction   Part   of the Direction concerns the exercise of the discretion under s   once a decision has been made that the character test is not satisfied  a matter which is conceded by Mr Green in this case  Part   provides that  when exercising the discretion   decision makers must have regard to  three primary considerations  namely  the protection of the Australian community  the expectations of the Australian community and  if relevant  the best interests of any children involved  Other considerations  which are not  primary considerations  and are not mandatory  include the effects on the visa holder s family  evidence of rehabilitation  the likelihood of breaching or evading obligations under a legal or other ongoing matter  the duration of the proposed stay in Australia and whether the visa is permanent or temporary   Paragraph     of the Direction identifies three factors which are relevant to the protection of the Australian community  They are the seriousness and nature of the conduct  the likelihood of recidivism and whether visa cancellation would provide general deterrence   Of importance to this case is the process laid down by the Direction for considering  the seriousness and the nature of the conduct of a non citizen   Paragraph     outlines what the Minister views as serious offences  and paragraph     states that the sentence imposed for a crime is an appropriate indicator of the seriousness of the offender s conduct against the community  Paragraph     then provides that decision makers must take into account certain mitigating considerations     When exercising discretion  decision makers must also take the following factors into account as relevant considerations           a  any relevant factors provided by the non citizen as mitigating factors            b  the offence is not classified as an offence in Australia               c  a lighter sentence would be incurred in Australia for a similar offence  or          d  the non citizen has been pardoned       Emphasis added   The Tribunal s reasons comprehensively set out at     the chronology of facts and the evidence relevant to this matter  The Tribunal summarised Mr Green s personal history  detailed his criminal record in Australia since   and described the events leading up to the cancellation of his visa by the Minister and his detention on   August     The Tribunal s reasons summarised the evidence led by Mr Green  most of which pertained to Mr Green s explanation of his personal history  how and why he came to possess a criminal record  and also some mitigating circumstances  His reasons  in short  were that he had led a life of few opportunities  and that he had unfortunately been surrounded by  bad kids  then bad adults   The Tribunal described Mr Green s time in prison  and noted his evidence which stated that he was not a  vicious outlaw type of criminal  but rather more of the  Robin Hood  type  The Tribunal also discussed Mr Green s developing drug addiction  and the crimes he committed to support that addiction  as well as the rehabilitation which Mr Green had sought in art and family   The Tribunal found Mr Green s evidence unsatisfactory in certain respects  It concluded at   that although Mr Green s evidence should not  be entirely discarded  his tendency towards exaggeration and opportunistic fabrication dictates a certain caution in evaluating it   An observation as to the need for caution in this context does not mean that Mr Green s evidence was rejected out of hand   After making this finding  the Tribunal addressed the psychological and other evidence before it  Several psychological assessments of Mr Green were before the Tribunal and  although they appeared to  differ in material respects  the Tribunal found at      It is difficult to derive much assistance from this part of the evidence  other than to conclude that the applicant has psychological problems  whether produced by drug abuse  incarceration  an unhappy childhood or a combination of all three  He has not to date been able to shake off anti social or self destructive patterns of behaviour but is not a hopeless case  He could be rehabilitated and his development of his artistic capacities  as well as his  drug rehabilitation  program are positive steps  as is the possibility of employment and of continuing his relationship with  a female friend    The Tribunal then summarised other evidence provided by friends and family of Mr Green  which detailed various matters of personal concern  including the likelihood of Mr Green obtaining employment after his release from prison  continuing an intimate relationship with a female friend  and succeeding in an artistic career
