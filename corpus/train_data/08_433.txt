J P Morgan Portfolio Services Limited v Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Securities and Investments Commission   NSWSC         ALR  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  The Court s discretion under s  AH is very wide  The factors to be taken into account in the exercise of that discretion include the circumstances in which the company was de registered  the purpose in seeking its re registration and the likely prejudice to any person  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Securities and Investments Commission   NSWSC         ALR   at    In this case the purpose of the order is to allow the company to take its place alongside the other asset vendors as a respondent and cross claimant in the proceedings  As such  its fortunes would stand or fall with the other respondents and cross claimants  The company s ability to contribute financially to any order made against the respondents would depend on its success in the cross claim  however there is no suggestion that its position in defending the claims made by the applicants in the main proceeding or in pursuing the cross claim would differ from that of the other respondents and cross claimants  At this stage there has been no submission that the company s participation would be likely to add to the costs in the proceeding   The applicants on the notice of motion have tendered a letter dated   March   from ASIC which states that ASIC does not oppose the application on the following conditions         The order sought for reinstatement is in terms of section  AH  of the Corporations Act   requiring ASIC to reinstate the registration of the company       The company  if ordered to be reinstated  continues in liquidation  subject to any order made by the Court in this regard  and a liquidator appointed       The Court order is lodged with ASIC     so that the company may be reinstated       The Applicant pays ASIC s costs of   for consideration of this matter       The applicant notifies ASIC upon conclusion of the winding up so that the company may be deregistered   The letter from ASIC points out that if the company was re registered it would return on ASIC s register to the status of External Administration  Clearly condition   above assumes that re registration of the company would not automatically reinstate Mr Taylor as liquidator and therefore that it would be necessary to appoint a liquidator   There are conflicting authorities as to whether a liquidator of a company who was in office at the time the company was de registered is automatically reinstated to that office when the company is restored to the register  In Brownlie v TTPM Pty Ltd     ACLC     Hamilton J held that in such circumstances the liquidator was automatically reinstated and approved a statement to that effect made in A R Keay  McPherson  The

legislation to the present  His Honour noted that the specific provision in s  AH  for the automatic reinstatement as director of a person who was a director of a company immediately before it was

intended to produce  which  in my view  entails continuity of that aspect of the company s characteristics which causes it to be in the course of winding up  the orders that the court makes should  in

substituted  those provisions should be observed   His Honour made orders for the reinstatement of registration and the continuation of the liquidator in office  In Donmastry Barrett J confirmed the view he had expressed in Ramantanis although  as the liquidator at the time of deregistration did not wish to continue in office and had expressly consented to another liquidator being appointed in his place  his Honour acceded to that request citedNational Australia Bank Ltd v Market Holdings Pty Ltd  in liq        FLR   The  Caesar s wife  standard of impartiality and independence for liquidators is established beyond the need for authority  however  if support for the proposition is needed it is not necessary to go beyond Young J s comprehensive discussion of the issue in National Australia Bank Ltd v Market Holdings Pty Ltd  in liq      FLR   at      Nevertheless  as Mr Stoljar accepted  the mere fact that a proposed liquidator s relationship with the company falls within one or more of the categories listed in s  c  does not preclude his or her appointment as the section itself provides that the Court has discretion in the matter  When asked what was the substance of the conflict that J P Morgan fears  Mr Stoljar was not able to put the matter higher than that his client has  an apprehension  that Mr Taylor would find it difficult to reconcile his various roles in the proceedings  particularly his role as liquidator of a company  a contingent creditor of which is his client   In this case the application for reinstatement of the company has been brought for the limited purpose of this litigation  Although  once reinstated  the company exists for all purposes there is no reason to suspect that there is any purpose behind the application other than that stated  It seems to me that  as matters presently stand  the reinstatement of GC   Associates has the effect of preserving the respondents  position without substantive prejudice  The main proceeding here is estimated to be long and complicated and it seems unnecessary to add further expense and delay by requiring a liquidator other than Mr Taylor to be appointed because of a potential conflict that may  in substance  never eventuate  Should the proceeding result in the company being indebted to Mr Stoljar s client  any substantive prejudice can be addressed by an appropriate application to the Court at that stage  I should also note that J P Morgan may also reserve its position in relation to the matters mentioned in   above   The applicants on the notice of motion have brought in short minutes of order providing for the re instatement of GC   Associates Pty Ltd by ASIC  the subsequent appointment of Mr Taylor as liquidator of the company and all ancillary matters including any amendment of the cross claim  the defence to the cross claim and any application for security for costs  I shall make orders in accordance with those short minutes   I certify that the preceding sixteen   numbered
