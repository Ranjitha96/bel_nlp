and what was not put to the now Appellant during the course of the Tribunal hearing  A submission advanced on behalf of the Respondent Minister by his Senior Counsel as to prejudice should the Ground be entertained is not to be dismissed lightly  Prejudice is claimed by reason of a lost   opportunity to call evidence to rebut the proposed allegations about what issues were raised and how they were raised at the Tribunal s three hearings    It is appropriate to refuse leave to amend where   it may be unfair to the respondent  who may have been able to call evidence at first instance to rebut the proposed allegations  if they had been made at that stage   Applicant A  of   v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC   at   per Tamberlin  Madgwick and Hely JJ  Leave to amend should also be rejected on this further basis  Even if leave were granted  the proposed Ground would be rejected  The Appeal is to be dismissed  The written outline of submissions as filed on behalf of the Respondent Minister seeks costs  The Appellant accepted that if the appeal was to be dismissed  there was no reason why costs should not follow the event  Although the Minister may not have prevailed in respect to all of the contentions sought to be advanced in his Notice of Contention   he has substantially prevailed  The appeal is thus to be dismissed with costs

Citizenship   FCAFC       FCR    Spender  Edmonds and Tracey JJ there usefully summarised as follows some of the less contentious matters involved in the construction of that provision      In a series of cases decided under s  R    it has been common ground that the subsection suffers from a lack of clarity  Before turning to the difficulties to which the drafting gives rise  it will be convenient to mention some uncontentious matters relating to the construction of the subsection  First  the subsection is cast in imperative terms  it obliges a decision maker to disregard conduct in Australia by an applicant for a protection visa subject to the proviso in paragraph  b   Secondly  the stipulation that a decision maker must  disregard  an applicant s conduct in Australia requires that such conduct not be brought into consideration when determining whether the applicant has a well founded fear of being persecuted for a Convention reason  Thirdly  although the Explanatory Memorandum and the second reading speech both indicate that s  R  of the Act was introduced to deal with sur place claims  it is not  in terms  so confined  Conduct in Australia which is undertaken in order to attract the adverse attention of the authorities in the applicant s country of origin  would support a sur place claim  Other types of conduct may not  Section  R  obliges decision makers to disregard  any  conduct by the applicant in Australia  That requirement is qualified by paragraph  b  which provides scope for an applicant to satisfy the decision maker that he or she has engaged in the relevant conduct  otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening the person s claims to be a refugee       Conduct in Australia which attracts adverse attention from a foreign government for Convention related reasons would strengthen a person s claim to be a refugee  So too  however  would conduct in Australia which  in an evidentiary sense  rendered it more likely that an applicant had engaged in conduct in his or her home country which led to persecution in that country  Both types of conduct may be engaged in in Australia         Decisions of this Court were the catalyst for the introduction of s  R   Those decisions held that a person could become a refugee as a result of conduct  deliberately pursued in Australia  to attract the adverse attention of the authorities in his or her country of origin    FCAFC   at     Special leave to appeal  it should be noted  has been granted  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZJGV  Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v

s reasons  cf Liang  supra  it emerges that the Tribunal did   challenge   the Appellant s account  The reasons for decision of the Tribunal thus recount the following exchange          I also mentioned to the applicant that it was of concern to the Tribunal that he did not tell his agent his real name or that he was in fear of religious persecution  It was also of concern to the Tribunal that he did not attend church until   November   even though he arrived in Australia in June    I mentioned to the applicant that a chronology of his applications indicated that he had exhausted all lines of application by August    The applicant stated that he did not know his application had been rejected  I mentioned to the applicant that it was difficult for the Tribunal to understand why he did not attend the church before November   given his claims of being a committed Christian  I mentioned to the applicant that he told the Tribunal that the reason he attended an underground church in China was because he valued the community spirit which was not available at the official church  I mentioned to the applicant that if that was the case it was difficult to see why he did not seek that out as soon as he arrived in Australia where he could do so freely  The applicant stated that he had no Christian friends so he worshiped   sic   on his own        I discussed with the applicant

understood why the information was relevant to the review  s  A b  citedMZKAM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlA principal consideration to be taken into account when exercising the discretion is the interest of the proper administration of justice and the need to ensure that a decision has been made in a procedurally fair manner and in accordance with law  In some cases arguments have been entertained and leave granted to file a Notice of Contention even after the conclusion of a hearing  e g  MZKAM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA    A further consideration relevant to the exercise of discretion is the fact that the issues sought to be pursued in the Notice

Contention  citedMZXKH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlThe proposed new Ground in the present proceeding seeks to contend that the   strict requirements   of s  A b  have not been satisfied because the Tribunal s letter forwarded to the Appellant failed to identify the purpose for which information set forth could be used  The letter providing notice to the Appellant of the information in respect to which   comments or response   were sought was dated   July    That letter set forth   information   and continued to state as follows    The above information is relevant because it could lead the Tribunal to find that you did not fear persecution in China  as presently claimed  Your statements to the Departmental officers in September   that you were willing to return to China could lead the Tribunal to find that you were not in fear of persecution should you return to China  The fact that you went to the Chinese Consulate and were issued with a travel document in   and your statement to the Departmental officer that you decided not to go to China in   because you could earn more money in Australia could also lead the Tribunal to be unsatisfied in relation to your claims to fear persecution in China  If the Tribunal makes these findings it will not be satisfied about your persecution claims and may affirm the delegate s decision not to grant a protection visa       No complaint is made by the Appellant as to compliance with s  A a    it is accepted that   clear particulars   of information have been provided  Section  A a  requires an applicant to be provided with   sufficient specificity   of the information to be relied upon  Language which fails to identify information with   sufficient specificity   and which fails to   unambiguously   set forth information may fail to comply with s  A a  e g  MZXKH v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA   at   per Tracey J  The argument for the Appellant is that the   July   letter put him on notice that the information previously set forth in the letter could be used merely for the purpose of making a finding that the Appellant did not fear persecution as claimed  The contravention arose   so it was argued   because the letter did not state that the information could also be used for the purpose of making a finding as to credibility  The argument is rejected discussedNAOA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlReference to a

per McHugh  Gummow  Callinan and Heydon JJ  Whether an inference is or is not available must obviously depend upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case  The difficulties adverted to by the Full Court in NAOA are only compounded in the present appeal when attention is directed to the Tribunal s reasons for decision and its account as to that which occurred during the course of the three hearings   the first being held on   June   the second on   July   and the resumed hearing on   July    The first hearing took some   hours  the second some     hours and the third some   hours  Notwithstanding the length of each of the hearings  the Tribunal s summary of that which occurred was somewhat brief  No criticism is made of the Tribunal in so summarising the events that took place before it  But the very fact that the summary provided is necessarily so brief renders it very unsafe in the present proceeding to draw any inference that a particular issue was not addressed because it is not mentioned in the summary provided  Second  if a process of inference were engaged in  it would tell against the Appellant  Submissions advanced on behalf of the Appellant after the conclusion of the hearing thus addressed the question as to the Appellant s religious practices  including a submission stating in part as follows    In this matter  if you find that the applicant is a genuine Christian who is opposed to practicing   sic   his faith outside the State sanctioned religious institutions in the PRC  you must assess the extent of this commitment and whether he has a well founded fear of being harmed as a consequence of his commitment to the practice of his faith in this manner      The Tribunal has been presented with a considerable amount of evidence from people who know the applicant in Australia and who knew him in the PRC  This evidence has been to the effect that the applicant has engaged in the practice of his Christian faith outside the confines of the State sanctioned religious institutions in the PRC for most of his life  With the exception of a brief period in Australia  the applicant has always practiced his faith publicly by attending religious services  The evidence of Rev  Lawrence in this regard is that the applicant has been a regular attendee at his church for more than   years      In our submission  the Tribunal ought to accept that the applicant is someone who has demonstrated a commitment to practicing his faith outside the confines of the State sanctioned religious institutions in the PRC and that he would continue to practice his faith in this manner in the future  even if he were returned to the PRC     If an inference were drawn  it would be an inference that the now Appellant recognised that an issue needing to be addressed was whether or not the Tribunal should find that he was   a genuine Christian    Attempts by the Appellant to characterise this and other such submissions as more directed to the nature of the religious activity practised  as opposed to whether or not the Appellant was a genuine Christian  are rejected citedNBBO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCA

contrary  SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   HCA       CLR    Gleeson CJ  Kirby  Hayne  Callinan and Heydon JJ there observed      No submission was made on behalf of either the appellant or the Minister that the existence or content of the obligation to accord procedural fairness was directly affected by any provision of the Act  Rather  the argument proceeded  for the most part  by reference to what had been said by the Full Court of the Federal Court in Alphaone   Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at   to    The Full Court  Northrop  Miles and French JJ  said     Where the exercise of a statutory power attracts the requirement for procedural fairness  a person likely to be affected by the decision is entitled to put information and submissions to the decision maker in support of an outcome that supports his or her interests  That entitlement extends to the right to rebut or qualify by further information  and comment by way of submission  upon adverse material from other sources which is put before the decision maker  It also extends to require the decision maker to identify to the person affected any issue critical to the decision which is not apparent from its nature or the terms of the statute under which it is made  The decision maker is required to advise of any adverse conclusion which has been arrived at which would not obviously be open on the known material   Subject to these qualifications however  a decision maker is not obliged to expose his or her mental processes or provisional views to comment before making the decision in question   emphasis added   Their Honours continued      The Tribunal is not confined to whatever may have been the issues that the delegate considered  The issues that arise in relation to the decision are to be identified by the Tribunal  But if the Tribunal takes no step to identify some issue other than those that the delegate considered dispositive  and does not tell the applicant what that other issue is  the applicant is entitled to assume that the issues the delegate considered dispositive are  the issues arising in relation to the decision under review   That is why the point at which to begin the identification of issues arising in relation to the decision under review will usually be the reasons given for that decision  And unless some other additional issues are identified by the Tribunal  as they may be  it would ordinarily follow that  on review by the Tribunal  the issues arising in relation to the decision under review would be those which the original decision maker identified as determinative against the applicant     See also  NBKB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship

that the reason he attended an underground church in China was because he valued the community spirit which was not available at the official church  I mentioned to the applicant that if that was the case it was difficult to see why he did not seek that out as soon as he arrived in Australia where he could do so freely  The applicant stated that he had no Christian friends so he worshiped   sic

acknowledged    suffers from a lack of clarity   SZJGV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCAFC       FCR    Spender  Edmonds and Tracey JJ there usefully summarised as follows some of the less contentious matters involved in the construction of that provision      In a series of cases decided under s  R    it has been common ground that the subsection suffers from a lack of clarity  Before turning to the difficulties to which the drafting gives rise  it will be convenient to mention some uncontentious matters relating to the construction of the subsection  First  the subsection is cast in imperative terms  it obliges a decision maker to disregard conduct in Australia by an applicant for a protection visa subject to the proviso in paragraph  b   Secondly  the stipulation that a decision maker must  disregard  an applicant s conduct in Australia requires that such conduct not be brought into consideration when determining whether the applicant has a well founded fear of being persecuted for a Convention reason  Thirdly  although the Explanatory Memorandum and the second reading speech both indicate that s  R  of the Act was introduced to deal with sur place claims  it is not  in terms  so confined  Conduct in Australia which is undertaken in order to attract the adverse attention of the authorities in the applicant s country of origin  would support a sur place claim  Other types of conduct may not  Section  R  obliges decision makers to disregard  any  conduct by the applicant in Australia  That requirement is qualified by paragraph  b  which provides scope for an applicant to satisfy the decision maker that he or she has engaged in the relevant conduct  otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening the person s claims to be a refugee       Conduct in Australia which attracts adverse attention from a foreign government for Convention related reasons would strengthen a person s claim to be a refugee  So too  however  would conduct in Australia which  in an evidentiary sense  rendered it more likely that an applicant had engaged in conduct in his or her home country which led to persecution in that country  Both types of conduct may be engaged in in Australia         Decisions of this Court were the catalyst for the introduction of s  R   Those decisions held that a person could become a refugee as a result of conduct  deliberately pursued in Australia  to attract the adverse attention of the authorities in his or her country of origin    FCAFC   at     Special leave to appeal  it should be noted  has been granted  Minister for Immigration

decision of a Tribunal may provide a basis upon which a conclusion may be reached that that issue was in fact addressed and considered during the course of a Tribunal hearing  But the difficulty in drawing an inference that an issue was not addressed because of the absence of any reference to that issue in the reasons for decision of a Tribunal is a difficulty that has been adverted to by the Full Court in NAOA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC    When addressing a submission that an inference should be drawn that the Tribunal did not raise an issue with the appellant  Beaumont  Merkel and Hely JJ there observed      We cannot accept this submission  for several reasons      For one thing  as the respondent submitted  the appellant s case is premised upon an assumption  that was also made by the learned Magistrate  albeit on a tentative basis  namely  that the Tribunal had not raised the issue of the authenticity of certain documents with the appellant at the hearing  However  his Honour did not make a finding in relation to this matter  Driver FM observed that this  appeared  to be the case  from the record of the  Tribunal  decision   On the evidence before his Honour  it was not open to him to have made a finding that this issue had not been canvassed  His Honour had no transcript   As mentioned  the tape is before us and we refer to it below   The appellant had not given any evidence  in affidavit form or orally  to the effect that this issue had not been raised  There was simply no basis upon which his Honour could properly have made this finding  His reasons should not be read as if he did so  In the absence of evidence about what occurred at the hearing  the appelant   sic   has no sufficient evidential basis for the grounds he seeks to raise  thus he has not  in our opinion  established that the Tribunal did not comply with the rules of natural justice     Their Honours were obviously directing attention to the facts then before the Court  But the caution expressed as to the dangers in too readily drawing inferences from an incomplete factual foundation is to be heeded  The decision in NAOA

Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  htmlAn application for review was filed with the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia in September   and an amended application was filed in November    The Federal Magistrates Court dismissed the application  SZMTJ v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FMCA    In so doing  the Federal Magistrate rejected an allegation of bias on the part of the Tribunal  The Federal Magistrate  however  further concluded that there had been a breach of s  R of the Migration Act but declined relief in the exercise of his discretion  A Notice of Appeal was filed in this Court on   February    Before the Federal Magistrate  Counsel for the Respondent Minister   submitted that  whilst the Tribunal found that there had been some conduct in Australia  it was entitled to have regard to that conduct in the manner in which it did  having proper regard to the principles that govern s   R       FMCA   at     The Federal Magistrate went on to summarise the submissions then advanced as follows      Specifically  s   R  did not require the Tribunal to disregard the applicant s participation in religious activities in Australia because it implicitly  emphasis added  found that the applicant s purpose in attending church was for a purpose other than strengthening his protection visa claims  and it explicitly  again  emphasis added  found an alternate explanation for the applicant s attending church  namely companionship        Similarly  the applicant s lodgement of an earlier application for a protection visa was not conduct that could be said to enhance the applicant s claims for a protection visa and therefore it was not required by s   R   to be disregarded        Again  the fact that the applicant had obtained a travel document did not need to be disregarded by s   R   It did not enhance the applicant s claims for refugee status  If anything  this conduct detracted from the applicant s claims for a protection visa        Consequently  counsel for the Minister submitted that there was no jurisdictional error constituted by a breach of s   R  of the Migration Act   or at all     The Federal Magistrate then went on to resolve submissions directed to other factual matters said to also involve a contravention of s  R and concluded in respect to the   application and the request for Ministerial intervention in   as follows      This conduct can not  to my mind  be characterised as conduct that could not be understood as an attempt to enhance the applicant s claim to be a refugee  He certainly practised deception  but the motive appears to be an attempt to enhance his claim for a protection visa  Accordingly  the Tribunal was required to disregard it under the provisions of s   R      The Federal Magistrate thereafter went on to decline relief in the exercise of his discretion  reasoning as follows      What remains to be considered  therefore  is whether the Tribunal s failure to disregard the applicant s conduct in applying for a protection visa in a false name and also applying for the exercise of the Minister s discretion in that same false name is a failure to comply with s   R  and therefore a jurisdictional error        In my view  the Tribunal failed to comply with s   R  in this instance and therefore fell into jurisdictional error        However  I am not satisfied that the Court should grant to the applicant the relief that he seeks  The balance of the evidence before the Tribunal is of such weight that the Tribunal s adverse credibility finding against the applicant can stand even if the evidence of the earlier application for a protection visa and the exercise of the Minister s discretion were to be disregarded  It is not in the interests of the administration of justice for the applicant to be granted relief by way of certiorari and mandamus because of a mere technicality     It was this exercise of discretion which was the occasion for the Order   r   referral  Section  R  provides as follows    For the purposes of the application of this Act and the regulations to a particular person       a  in

disregard any conduct engaged in by the person in Australia unless       b  the person satisfies the Minister that the person engaged in the conduct otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening the

Notice of Contention    ii  an application by the Appellant to file an Amended Notice of Appeal   and    iii  the existing Notice of Appeal     The Notice of Contention seeks to raise a number of

raising at least some of the contentions sought to be advanced in the Notice of Contention   The jurisdiction of the Court to entertain a new argument was accepted to be only constrained by the well
