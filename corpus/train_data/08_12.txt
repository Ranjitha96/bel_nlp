Co Pty Ltd  in liq      NSWLR     Nathan   McLelland J  as McLelland CJ in Eq then was  discussed the principles that govern an application by a liquidator for directions under the then s   of the Corporations Law  Cth   That provision is now found in s   of the Act  and was  and is   The liquidator may apply to the Court for directions in relation to any particular matter arising under the winding up   His Honour traced the historical background to s   and concluded  at     The historical antecedents of s     the terms of that subsection and the provisions of s   as a whole combine to lead to the conclusion that the only proper subject of a liquidator s application for directions is the manner in which the liquidator should act in carrying out his functions as such  and that the only binding effect of  or arising from  a direction given in pursuance of such an application  other than rendering the liquidator liable to appropriate sanctions if a direction in mandatory or prohibitory form is disobeyed  is that the liquidator  if he has made full and fair disclosure to the court of the material facts  will be protected from liability for any alleged breach of duty as liquidator to a creditor or contributory or to the company in respect of anything done by him in accordance with the direction    His Honour said that modern Australian authorities  to which he referred  also confirmed the view that s   did not enable the court to make binding orders in the nature of judgments  and that the purpose of a liquidator s application for directions was  to give  the liquidator  advice as to his proper course of action in the liquidation      not to determine the rights and liabilities arising from the company s transactions before the liquidation   at

added that one reason for making directions in that limited form is that even if authorised by the section  binding orders would not in fact be made unless all affected parties or their representatives were properly before the Court   It would have been possible for the Court to decline to give directions unless  with Stacks  consent  the Court converted the present proceeding into an inter partes proceeding by appointing and joining as a party  a representative of the members entitled to the First Mortgage Interest Portfolio  see below  on the one hand  and a representative of the members entitled to the High Yield Income Portfolio  see below  on the other hand  see Nathan at   per McLelland J and authorities there cited by his Honour  This course would have had the advantage that the members having interests in the remaining assets of those respective Portfolios would have been bound by the result citedTom Thompson Pty Ltd v Pilley     FCR   In Editions Tom
