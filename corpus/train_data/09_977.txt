Lee v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedCity of Brunswick v Stuart   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlConcerning the contention that cl     was invalid because it was uncertain  Smith FM said  The applicants  submissions referred to a statement by Starke J in Brunswick Corp v Stewart   HCA         CLR   at   cited by Weinberg J in Vanstone v Clark at    This suggests that delegated legislation could be held invalid because it is   uncertain  that is  does not contain adequate information as to the duties of those who are to obey it     or is unreasonable  that is  in this connection  so oppressive or capricious that no reasonable mind can justify it     The applicants argued that there was uncertainty or unreasonableness in the test of  not generally acceptable in Australia  because it lacked a meaningful identification of the standards of  acceptability  for business activities which were to be applied by a decision maker  As a consequence  it was conceivable that decision makers might apply their own idiosyncratic standards  and might penalise behaviour which was trivial or not deserving of the withholding of a visa        However  I do not accept these arguments      In my judgment  the Federal Magistrate was correct to reject the contention that cl     was invalid because it did not contain adequate information as to the duties of those who are to obey it  cf City of Brunswick v Stuart   HCA         CLR   and Evans v New South Wales   FCAFC         FCR     at   and   relied onEvans v New South Wales   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  htmlIn my judgment  the Federal Magistrate was correct to reject the contention that cl     was invalid because it did not contain adequate information as to the duties of those who are to obey it  cf City of Brunswick v Stuart   HCA         CLR   and Evans v New South Wales   FCAFC         FCR     at   and    In Evans   the regulation subject to challenge was cl   of the World Youth Day Regulation    NSW  which relevantly provided      An authorised person may direct a person within a World Youth Day declared area to cease engaging in conduct that        b  causes annoyance or inconvenience to participants in a World Youth Day event        The Full Court said  at     The principal issue in relation to cl   is its application under cl  b  to conduct that  causes annoyance     to participants in a World Youth Day event   The term  annoy  as defined in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary relevantly means   To affect so as to ruffle  trouble  vex       Annoyance has a corresponding meaning  The Macquarie Dictionary defines  annoy  as     To disturb in a way that is displeasing  troubling or slightly irritating     Conduct which may attract a direction under cl  b  is conduct which  causes annoyance     to participants in a World Youth Day event   That is to say it is conduct which actually results in its observers being ruffled  troubled  vexed  disturbed  displeased or slightly irritated  These are responses which depend very much on the individuals concerned  Some may find protests of the kind which are proposed by the applicants mildly amusing  Others may be practising Catholics or Christians who agree with some of the protestors  points and are not troubled by them      There is no objective criterion to assist the judgment of  an authorised person  in deciding whether to issue a direction under cl    There may be circumstances in which it would be difficult if not impossible for a person to whom a direction is given to know whether his or her conduct was such as to authorise the giving of the direction  It is little consolation to the person affected by a direction that he or she could argue the point later in a prosecution in a court of law as the State suggested  The Full Court continued  at     In our opinion the conduct regulated by cl  b  so far as it relates to  annoyance  may extend to expressions of opinion which neither disrupt nor interfere with the freedoms of others  nor are objectively offensive in the sense traditionally used in State criminal statutes  The Full Court in Evans concluded that  annoyance  was something that turned on individual impression and that empowering a person to tell people to stop annoying other people was not supported by the statutory power conferred by s   of the relevant Act  On the other hand  the Full Court upheld the validity of cl  b  of the regulations authorising a direction to cease engaging in conduct that causes inconvenience to participants in a World Youth Day event  because it was posited on an ascertainable fact  At   the Full Court said    The term  inconvenience  has a more objective content  The relevant definition in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary is     Harm  injury  mischief  misfortune  trouble       It is used in a transitive sense by reference to the effect of the relevant conduct on participants  The Macquarie Dictionary defines it as     Arranged or happening in such a way as to be awkward  inopportune  disadvantageous or troublesome       While the term is broad it does not depend upon the subjective reactions of participants in World Youth Day events to the conduct in question  It requires a judgment by the authorised person of objective inconvenience  Such inconvenience may arise  for example  where protestors by their locations or actions hinder or obstruct the movement of participants or are so loud in their protest as to impair communications between groups of participants and officials  The term  inconvenience  may be criticised as conferring wide powers of uncertain ambit upon authorised persons but it is  in our opinion  a term which can reasonably be construed as limited to matters susceptible of objective judgment discussedIreland v Wilson   All ER  Refshauge J also referred to Ireland v Wilson   All ER     where a by law which provided  Every driver of a motor hackney carriage shall when working or plying for hire     conduct himself in a proper civil and decorous manner at all times  was held to be valid  His Honour noted  at         there are many examples of criminal laws which depend upon judgment  dangerous driving and manslaughter by negligent conduct come easily to mind  Refshauge J concluded that reg     was not invalid  as being uncertain referred toKing Gee Clothing Company Pty Ltd v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlDixon J  as he then was  in King Gee Clothing Company Pty Ltd v Commonwealth   HCA         CLR     King Gee   said  at     I am unaware of any principle of law or of interpretation which places upon a power of subordinate legislation conferred upon the Governor General by the Parliament a limitation or condition making either reasonableness or certainty indispensable to its valid exercise  Dixon J did acknowledge in King Gee that a regulation could be invalid if it provided a standard according to a fact that was not ascertainable  The High Court held in King Gee that the regulation  properly construed  was incapable of determining a price for outwear clothing which was what the empowering Act required the regulation to do  As a consequence  it was held that the regulation was invalid discussedMerrell v Roberts     WN  NSW   Refshauge J referred to Merrell v Roberts     WN  NSW      which held that a regulation which prohibited driving  at such rate of speed     or in a manner as to     frighten or injure any     animal  was held not to be uncertain  Refshauge J said    The court held that it was not difficult for a court to consider whether under the circumstances of the case the vehicle was being driven at such a speed referred toR v Goreng Goreng   ACTSC         FLR  http www austlii edu au au cases act ACTSC  htmlCounsel for the appellants referred also to the judgment of Refshauge J in R v Goreng Goreng   ACTSC         FLR    That case was concerned with the validity of a regulation  reg     of the Public Service Regulations    Cth   Regulation     prohibited the disclosure of information which Australian public service employees had obtained or generated in connection with their employment  where it was        reasonably foreseeable that the disclosure could be prejudicial to the effective working of government  including the formulation or implementation of policies or programs  His Honour held that the description of what information should not be permitted to be disclosed  by reference to the  effective working of government  did not invalidate the regulation on the ground of uncertainty
