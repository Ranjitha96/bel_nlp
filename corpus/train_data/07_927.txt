Banks submit that there is no serious question to be tried  At a general level what is said on behalf of the Banks as to the well established independence or autonomy of irrevocable letters of credit  is uncontroversial  A standby letter of credit is a letter of credit which performs the function of providing security against the danger that a party to a contract will fail to perform it  Bachmann Pty Ltd v BHP Power New Zealand Ltd   VSCA         VR   at       The purpose of a standby letter of credit is  to provide the beneficiary with an unfettered  immediate remedy upon the triggering event on the letter of credit  pending resolution of any dispute on the underlying contract  Ideas Plus Investments Ltd v NAB Ltd     WAR   at      A standby letter of credit is not simply a mere method of payment but creates a direct liability upon the banker independent of the underlying contract  Ideas Plus at         Bachmann at          The contractual promise between the banker and the beneficiary is unaffected by the terms of any underlying contract between the beneficiary and the applicant for the letter of credit  However the applicant for the letter of credit might be able to apply to prevent the beneficiary from claiming against the banker due to the terms of an underlying contract  Bachmann at          These principles apply equally to the performance guarantees the subject of this application   I now turn to consider a number of relevant authorities  In Bachmann the appellant agreed to design  manufacture  supply and commission steel manufacturing equipment for the respondent  A clause in the Supply Contract required the supplier to provide security for the performance of its obligations  which it did by an irrevocable standby letter of credit in favour of the purchaser  The letter of credit required the purchaser to provide the bank with a statement that the supplier had failed to comply with the contract and a sight draft  which the bank undertook to honour  The relevant clause provided       A party shall not convert into money security that does not consist of money until the party becomes entitled to exercise a right under the contract in respect of the security   Brooking JA with whom Tadgell JA and Ormiston JA agreed said       It is also plain that it is competent to the holder of security provided by the other contracting party to promise as part of the contract under which the security is provided the underlying contract not to do some act in relation to the security except in a certain event  Such a contractual promise is efficacious  not in the sense  of when the security is constituted by the obligation of a third person  that the third person can rely by way of defence as against the security holder on a term of the underlying contract  to which he was not a party  but in the sense that relief can be afforded to the person who procured the security in an action brought against the security holder on the promise contained in the underlying contract  No principle or rule of law would deny that a promise forming part of the underlying contract is in this sense efficacious  and the cases recognise this     The supplier in Bachmann did not seek to establish any case of fraud on the purchaser s part but relied only on the contractual qualification upon the purchaser s powers under the general conditions of the underlying contract to demand payment under the letter of credit  It was conceded that the clause referred to constituted a contractual qualification on the purchaser s powers in relation to the security  This is to be contrasted with earlier Australian cases where the initial question was whether the underlying contract on its proper construction qualified the security holder s powers to claim under the security  The only point in the appeal as his Honour put it was as to the content of the qualification   citedBolivinter Oil SA v Chase Manhattan Bank NA     Lloyd s Rep   The Banks submit that the only traditional exception where a banker may be enjoined  is where the beneficiary is fraudulently attempting to draw down the letter of credit  That is because of the Court s special jurisdiction to prevent fraud  which is wider than the jurisdiction to prevent the beneficiary breaching the underlying contract with the applicant for a letter of credit  Bolivinter Oil SA v Chase Manhattan Bank NA     Lloyd s Rep   at   Deutsche Ruckversicherung AG v Wallbrook Insurance Co Ltd     WLR   at     Ideas Plus at      There is no allegation of fraud here and so  the Banks submit  no injunction should be granted against them  The Banks nonetheless rightly  in my opinion  accept that another basis upon which the Banks might be enjoined is by reason of it being allegedly unconscionable  contrary to s  AA of the Act  for ONGC to exercise its contractual rights in the underlying construction contract and draw upon the performance guarantees although any such restraint would be ancillary to Clough s claim against ONGC referred toBoral Formwork v Action Makers   ATPR     I remain satisfied that there is a serious issue to be tried as to whether ONGC has acted unconscionably in contravention of s  AA of the Act in calling on or threatening to call on the performance guarantees despite there being no legal right  on its part  to do so  As Austin J said in Boral Formwork v Action Makers   ATPR     at   when referring relevantly to s  AA of the Act   The principle of autonomy  applicable to a standby letter of credit  cannot override the Statute    I am also satisfied that  upon the same factual matrix  there is a serious issue to be tried whether ONGC is in breach if the negative stipulation conditioning the right to call up the performance guarantees   These findings warrant the continuation of the injunctive orders as against ONGC  and subject to consideration of the balance of convenience  ancillary injunctive orders as against the Banks   In these circumstance it is not necessary for me presently to enter upon the question of the construction of the performance guarantees and in particular whether  as between the Banks and ONGC the obligation to pay under a call is conditioned by  breach of contract  by Clough  and if so  just what is required to be done by way of notice  or proof  or otherwise  in order for that condition to be satisfied citedCargill International SA v Bangladesh Sugar   Food Corporation     Lloyd s LR   The Banks contend that even if ONGC has incorrectly drawn down on the performance guarantees there

adequate remedy referred toClough Engineering Ltd v Oil   Natural Gas Corporation Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The affidavit of Mr Malcolm Rutter sworn   June   provides a very detailed account of the background to the Construction Contract and what has occurred since its execution  I have set out the relevant factual background as exposed in that affidavit in my reasons of   June   when I  amongst other things  restrained ONGC from taking any further step to demand or to obtain payment or renewing or claiming to renew a demand for payment from any of the respondent Banks under the respective performance guarantees  Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil   Natural Gas Corporation Ltd   FCA        It is accordingly not necessary for me to repeat that background detail here  Mr Rutter has variously deposed in his affidavit to the effect that Clough is not in any way in default under the Construction Contract  The Banks do not  understandably  attempt to contradict this  ONGC has not appeared in this application   It is fundamental to Clough s arguments that it is not relevantly in breach of the Construction Contract nor are there any other contractual bases such as to entitle ONGC to make a demand upon the Banks under the respective performance guarantees  It is contended alternatively that if it is in breach then ONGC has contributed to this in the sense that to the extent that Clough has not met any of its obligations  this has been directly caused by ONGC s failure to perform its obligations  In other words Clough s obligations are dependent upon ONGC s performance   Clough says that it has  at all material times  been ready willing and able to comply with its obligations  subject to ONGC s timely performance of its inter dependent obligations  Clough says that  otherwise  it has completed the work required of it  However  on the evidence of Mr Rutter  ONGC has been in breach of a number of its obligations  including failing to effect necessary well completion at the deep water field  as well as meeting invoiced payments from Clough in the order of US  million citedDeutsche Ruckversicherung AG v Wallbrook

Olex Focas   that there was a serious issue to be tried that the head contractor was acting unconscionably for the purposes of s  AA of the Act in calling up the performance guarantee  His Honour came to the opposite conclusion on the evidence before him in respect to the mobilisation procurement guarantees  This was because his Honour considered that the calling up the whole amount secured by this category of guarantees  when the greater part had already been paid  was  according to ordinary human standards  quite against conscience  and accordingly  unconscionable within the terms of the Act   I have already adverted to the well established line of authority underlining the importance of the certainty generated by letters of credit  performance bonds and the like  The Banks submit that this is an important factor on the balance of convenience and point to the case of Olex Focas Pty Ltd v Skodaexport Co Ltd where Batt J refused an injunction against either the beneficiary or the bank to prevent payment on performance bonds based on claims of unconscionable conduct contrary to s  AA of the Act   It is submitted that an injunction may well adversely affect the commercial reputation of the Banks in a way that would mean that those arranging international letters of credit and performance guarantees would prefer banks from other jurisdictions  This  it is contended  gives rise to an unquantifiable difficulty  which means that an undertaking as to damages  by Clough  may well be insufficient to protect the position of the Banks   As between Clough and ONGC I have already concluded  when granting an interim interlocutory injunction against ONGC that the balance of convenience favoured the grant of an injunction because the evidence demonstrated how Clough would be irreparably affected  both financially and through an adverse impact on its reputation  if ONGC were to press its demands and secured payment under the performance guarantees  I found that damages would not be an adequate remedy for Clough on the evidence then before me   In these circumstances  and in light of the serious issues to be tried as between Clough and ONGC  it is necessary  in my opinion  in order to preserve the status quo  and the efficacy of the injunctive orders made against ONGC  given the Banks  intention  otherwise  to pay under the guarantees  to restrain them from doing so  see Olex

Cth       There is a third exception  which is based on contract and is the most important for present purposes  A line of cases has recognised that whilst the Court will not restrain the issuer of the bond from acting on the unqualified promise to honour it  if the party in whose favour the bond has been given has made a contract promising not to call upon the bond  breach of that contractual promise may be enjoined on normal principles relating to the enforcement by injunction of negative stipulations in contracts    emphasis added referred toStern v McArthur   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  However  the Court held that there were serious questions to be tried whether the parties were engaged in trade and commerce between Australia and a place outside Australia  for the purposes of s   of the Act  and whether the head contractor had acted unconscionably  and in contravention of s  AA of the Act  by making demand under the mobilisation guarantees  in the sense that it had insisted on strict legal rights in circumstances which made that harsh or oppressive or caused hardship  Accordingly  the sub contractors were entitled to injunctions in respect of the mobilisation guarantees    Logue v Shoalhaven Shire Council     NSWLR   Stern v McArthur   HCA         CLR   referred to   Batt J in so finding held that the effect of the Act  applying as it did to international trade and commerce  was to work a substantial inroad into the well established common law autonomy of letters of credit and performance bonds and other bank guarantees  In that case the bank which operated in Victoria  had made a submitting appearance only   This conclusion was reached although the contractor was  in calling up these guarantees

unwritten law  for the purposes of s  AA of the Act       a  There is equitable relief analogous to relief against forfeiture even absent waiver or estoppel  where the first party s breach has effectively contributed to the second party s breach  equity may regard it as unconscionable for the first party to exercise its legal rights arising from the second party s breach  Legione v Hateley

The cases relied upon by his Honour included Wood Hall Ltd v The Pipeline Authority   HCA         CLR   at     per Gibbs J  with whom Mason J agreed  and at   per Stephen J  His Honour continued       I do not overlook the credible distinction between the effect of the underlying contract as between the parties to it and its effect  if any  as between the holder of the security and the third person whose obligation constitutes the security  One can for brevity speak of a contractual qualification upon the owner s powers in relation to the security where the underlying agreement between the owner and the contractor or supplier contains a term which restricts the exercise of those powers in some way     The Court declined to grant injunctions under the general law  they not having established a clear case of fraud by the head contractor in making demand under the guarantees and that the bank was aware of any such fraud at the time of the post payment  There was accordingly no serious question to be tried in that respect  In so finding the Court applied Wood Hall Ltd v The Pipeline Authority   HCA         CLR     In Wood Hall Ltd v The Pipeline Authority a condition in a contract for the construction of a pipeline required the contractor to provide a cash security or  alternatively  a bank guarantee as security for the contractors due and faithful performance of the work  This was in the nature of a performance guarantee  Another condition entitled the owner to retain   of the progress payments due to the contractor until the work had been performed and accepted in accordance with the contract  The owner  at the contractor s request  agreed to accept a bank guarantee in lieu of the monies retained  This was a so called retention guarantee  By each of the guarantees the bank unconditionally undertook to pay the owner on demand any sum up to the limit specified in each guarantee  When the work was almost complete  the owner demanded payment from the bank under the guarantee  The contactor sought declarations and orders the purpose of which was to restrain the bank from making payment to the Authority under four instruments described on their face as bank guarantees given by the bank to the Pipeline Authority  The Court there held that the owner was entitled to demand and be paid the amount of the performance guarantee whether or not there had been a want of due and faithful performance of the work  and the monies so paid must be held by him as security for the contractors due and faithful performance of the work   Gibbs J  having regard to the proper construction of the performance guarantee  said that to hold that the Banks should not pay on receiving a demand  but should be bound to inquire into the rights of the Authority and the contractor under a contract to which the bank was not a party would be to depart from the ordinary meaning of the undertaking that the Bank is to pay on demand   p   However  Stephen J observed that  if the construction contract itself had contained some qualification upon the Authority s power to make a demand under a performance guarantee  the position in relation to the grant of such an injunction might well have been different  p    Young J in Hortico  Australia  Pty Ltd v Energy Equipment Co  Australia  Pty Ltd     NSWLR   at     made observations to like effect   The Banks contend that even if ONGC has incorrectly drawn down on the performance guarantees there are remedies available between Clough and ONGC  for example  by suing the beneficiary for an account and payment of any overpayment under a performance bond  Cargill International SA v Bangladesh Sugar   Food Corporation     Lloyd s LR   at    See also Australasian Conference Association Ltd v Mainline Constructions Pty Ltd  in liq    HCA         CLR   at   and Wood Hall Ltd v Pipeline Authority   HCA         CLR   at    It points also to the fact that there is no suggestion that ONGC would be unable to repay any amount owing  Accordingly damages from ONGC  it is said  would be an adequate remedy referred toWorld Series Cricket Pty Ltd v Parish     ALR   Section   enables the Court  where  in its opinion  it
