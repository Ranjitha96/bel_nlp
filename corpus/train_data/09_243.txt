citedDraffin v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlIn Draffin v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union   FCA     Ryan J ordered that penalties be imposed on Walton for breaches arising from what occurred on   November    The penalties were    for breach of s   of the BCII Act    for breach of s  K d  of the WR Act  with half of the total penalty being suspended for   months  The penalties were agreed between Mr Draffin and Walton  His Honour considered them to be within the appropriate range especially having regard to the suspended component of the penalty  see Draffin at    Although there are three breaches of separate statutory provisions  there was essentially one unlawful act committed by the Union respondents  That act was the request to Walton that Monjon leave the site because its employees were employed on AWAs  I do not consider it to be appropriate to punish any of the Union respondents more than once for one unlawful act  However  the totality principle requires that a penalty be imposed for each contravention arising out of a course of conduct  but the most serious offence may attract the vast bulk of the overall penalty  The strongest statutory expression of what occurred on   November   is the statement that s   of the BCII Act was contravened  That is because that offence carries with it an element of coercion  reflecting negation of choice for Walton  That offence should attract the highest penalty and the others significantly smaller ones  I consider it important to take into account the penalty imposed on Walton by Ryan J  Walton s conduct was at least as serious as that of the Union  if not more serious  Walton could have resisted the coercive behaviour of the Union but took the easy way out  I do not consider it appropriate to impose a higher penalty on the Union than the one imposed on Walton  The   penalty on Walton  although within

cth FCA  htmlIn Stuart Mahoney v Construction  Forestry  Mining and Energy Union   FCA   at     Tracey J set out a number of  potentially relevant and applicable considerations for determining the appropriate penalty for a contravention of the BCII Act   Those considerations include  The nature and extent of the conduct which led to the breaches  The circumstances in which that relevant conduct took place  The nature and extent of any loss or damage sustained as a result of the breaches  Whether there had been similar previous conduct by the respondent  Whether the breaches were properly distinct or arose out of the one cause of conduct  The size of the business enterprise involved  Whether or not the breaches were deliberate  Whether senior management was involved in the breaches  Whether the party committing the breach had exhibited contrition  Whether the party committing the breach had taken coercive action  Whether the party committing the breach had cooperated with the enforcement authorities  The need to ensure compliance with minimum standards by provision of an effective means for investigation and enforcement of employee entitlements  The need for specific and general deterrence   i  the nature or extent of the conduct in breach of the BCII Act The action by the Union respondents led to Monjon being excluded from the site  There is no evidence that this led to any disruption to the site  Monjon received payment for the day on   November    It had expected to work on   and   November and for a couple of weeks following that  according to   of the agreed statement of facts filed in the proceeding  The conduct whilst serious and discriminatory against Monjon was transient in nature and confined to a single request on a single day  There is no evidence whether Monjon picked up other work on the days it had expected to work on the site  There is no evidence of any loss to Walton   ii  circumstances in which the conduct took place There was no issue about widespread or significant disruption to the site  The circumstances were confined as shown in the preceding paragraph   iii  whether or not the breaches were deliberate After the events of   November   and those referred to in Stuart Mahoney   the Union conducted a seminar in May   to enhance the chances of compliance with the BCII Act  see Stuart Mahoney at    It is also significant that the Union respondents admit that they have contravened the relevant statutory provisions  That is an aspect of contrition   vi  corrective action The only corrective action was the holding of the seminar   vii  cooperation The agreed statement of facts filed more than two weeks before the penalty hearing is evidence of cooperation with the relevant authorities   viii  minimum standards enforcement The statutory purposes of the BCII Act are referred to in Stuart Mahoney at    As Tracey J said at     The imposition of pecuniary penalties for contraventions of civil penalty provisions gives effect to the statutory purposes of the BCII Act     ix  deterrence As Tracey J said in Stuart Mahoney at    p enalties must be imposed at a meaningful level if they are to act as a general deterrent to others   Specific deterrence is also a factor which informs the level of penalty in this case   x  totality principle At   Tracey J said    Another factor to be considered is the totality principle  The principle is designed to ensure that the aggregate of penalties imputed is not such as to be oppressive or crushing    The orthodox position requires the determination of appropriate penalties for each contravention arising from the same course of conduct  The aggregate figure is then considered to ensure that the penalty is an appropriate response to the conduct in question       xi  previous conduct The closest relevant previous conduct is that identified in Stuart Mahoney   In Stuart Mahoney   the relevant events occurred over one month before   November    However  no penalty was imposed until   September    The circumstances of Stuart Mahoney were more serious than the current circumstances in that the overtime ban in that case caused a greater disruption to the site than did the exclusion of Monjon in this case  It is significant that these events also occurred before the May   seminar  Tracey J imposed a fine of   on the Union for breach of s   of the Act and   for breach of s    No unlawful industrial action arose in the present case  so s   is not relevant  The current breaches of ss   and   are less serious than the breach of s   in Stuart Mahoney   In Stuart Mahoney the overtime ban had a much greater disruptive effect on the site   xii  conclusion
