Reches Pty Ltd v Tadiran Pty Ltd     FCR   at     Given the extent to which Deumer stands to gain from the proceedings if they are successful  and that the cause of action is apparently the only asset of Cosdean which may enable it to be paid  or to be substantially paid  under its agency agreement with Cosdean  and that in essence it has no real competing external creditors who might participate in any award of damages  I think it is reasonable that Deumer support Cosdean in the prosecution of the claim  or at least that it have the opportunity to do so  It may wish to make its own assessment of Cosdean s prospects of success in the proceedings or of the likely award of any damages  and balance those things against the amount of the further security for costs I have ordered  That is a matter for Cosdean and Deumer  The circumstances are different from those where there are a number of creditors  including small creditors  cf Yandil   ACLC   at   Tullock Ltd v Walker  Unreported  Supreme Court of New South Wales  Yeldham J    December    There is no other evidence of commercial impracticability in Deumer supporting Cosdean in the claim  see Ariss     VR   at   per Phillips JA

 NZ  Ltd     NZLR   at   Memutu Pty Ltd v Lissenden     ACLR   at     Reches Pty Ltd v Tadiran Pty Ltd     FCR   at   consideredBell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corp     FCR   Once the threshold prescribed by s   is satisfied  the discretion as to whether to order security for costs is an unqualified one  Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corp     FCR   at   Sir Lindsay Parkinson   Co Ltd v Triplan Ltd   QB   Spiel v Commodity Brokers Australia Pty Ltd  In liq      SASR   Ratepayers   Residents Action Association Inc v Auckland City Council     NZLR     Those cases reflect the policy underlying s   that security may be ordered where a company appears to be in no position to provide security from its own resources where  in all the circumstances  it is reasonable that the resources of some other person or entity standing behind the company or of some person or entity for whose practical benefit the proceeding is being conducted should provide the security  The privilege of limited liability should not necessarily exclude those standing to benefit from proceedings by that company from having to provide support to it  Buckley v Bennell Design   Constructions Pty Ltd     ACLR   at      The approach was conveniently expressed in Bell Wholesale   FCR   at   where the Full Court  Sheppard  Morling and Neaves JJ  said     In our opinion a court is not justified in declining to order security on the ground that to do so will frustrate the litigation unless a company in the position of the applicant here establishes that those who stand behind it and who will benefit from the litigation if it is successful  whether they be shareholders or creditors or  as in this case  beneficiaries under a trust  are also without means   Cosdean accepts that  where the opposition to an application for security for costs is based upon the assertion that the effect of an order for security for costs will stultify a bona fide claim  the onus is upon the party asserting that effect to prove it  see Idoport Pty Ltd v National Australia Bank   NSWSC   at       and   per Einstein J  Bell Wholesale   FCR   at   Fiduciary Ltd v Morningstar Research Pty Ltd     ALR   at    The last mentioned case concerned a litigation funder  whose resources were considered to be relevant  Cosdean also accepts that there is no evidence that it has made any approach to Deumer to fund or support the proceedings  or to support any order for security for costs  There is no evidence to demonstrate that Deumer is either unable or unwilling to support Cosdean s action or of any other financial hardship or commercial impracticability in it doing so   Consequently  as I consider for the reasons given that the circumstances of Deumer are properly to be taken into account in considering the applications  it follows that Cosdean has not demonstrated that further orders for security for costs would stultify the proceedings  It may be that Deumer is unable to support the proceedings but that is purely speculation  If it were not prepared to  but had the capacity to do so  in circumstances where it had in effect the first call upon the proceeds of the action to the extent of some     million  that in itself would be a relevant consideration as to whether to make further orders for security for costs   As noted above  the respondents accept that Cosdean s claim is brought in good faith discussedBPM Pty Ltd v HPM Pty Ltd     FLR      In my view  having regard to the nature of the claim and the status of Deumer in relation to Cosdean and its real interest in the outcome of the proceedings  it is reasonable that the circumstances of Deumer should be taken into account on the applications for further security  In BPM Pty Ltd v HPM Pty Ltd     FLR   at   Anderson J adopted a similar approach  In other circumstances  the capacity of shareholders or directors of a limited liability company to support proceedings have been taken into account  as has the capacity of trustees of trading trusts  trust beneficiaries  members of associations  debenture holders  guarantors and appointors of receivers  see Colbran at     pp     and the cases cited there  The present circumstances provide simply another illustration of what may be taken into account  in appropriate circumstances  in addressing an application for security for costs against an impecunious corporate litigant citedBuckley v Bennell Design   Constructions Pty Ltd     ACLR   Those cases reflect the policy underlying s   that security may be ordered where a company appears to be in no position to provide security from its own resources where  in all the circumstances  it is reasonable that the resources of some other person or entity standing behind the company or of some person or entity for whose practical benefit the proceeding is being conducted should provide the security  The privilege of limited liability should not necessarily exclude those standing to benefit
