Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedD cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  The guiding principles which attend whether to grant leave to appeal are well settled  see D cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc   FCA         FCR    Full Court   Having regard to what was said in that case  considerations to which the Court should ordinarily advert in deciding a leave to appeal application may be summarised as follows   a  the prospects of success of the proposed appeal  i e  whether  in all the circumstances  the decision is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its being reconsidered by a Full Court  and   b  whether substantial injustice would result were leave to appeal refused  supposing the decision to be wrong   The Full Court s judgment in D cor Corporation also serves as a reminder that these considerations are not exhaustive and in no way preclude regard to special considerations which might  in a particular case  tend either for or against a grant of leave to appeal   Further  the very fact that Parliament has chosen in s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act to excise interlocutory judgments and orders from being the subject of an appeal as of right is itself eloquent  The making of a judicial value judgment in relation to whether an appeal ought to be permitted was plainly envisaged as a way of preventing indiscriminate appeals in respect of judgments and orders falling within the excised class  In that regard  both prior authority and instinct commend that there is a distinction to be drawn when considering an application for leave to appeal between an interlocutory judgment or order which determined a mere matter of practice and procedure and one which  at least in a practical sense  can be seen to have affected a substantive right  even if strictly not in a way that would render the judgment or order  final   There is obvious potential for too ready a grant of leave to appeal against a judgment or order of the former type to result in   a  a postponement of a final determination of the substantive issues between the parties   b  additional burdens in both legal expenses and emotion  the one not usually fully compensated by a costs order in favour of a successful Respondent  the other  even in that circumstance  for which such a Respondent is not at all compensated   c  related oppression of a less economically  or emotionally  well resourced party at the behest of another party who is either better resourced or so bereft of resources as to be indifferent to potentially adverse costs consequences if an interlocutory appeal were unsuccessful   Applying these guiding principles to the circumstances of this application  I am in no doubt that leave to appeal should be refused citedRogers v Asset Loan Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA

earlier and other proceedings which had been filed in this Court and elsewhere by Mrs Rogers or  as the case may be  Mr Rogers  It is instructive to reproduce his Honour s summary        I have analysed the extensive Statement of Claim in considerable detail  I have had regard to the reasons for judgment of Greenwood J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd   Ors   FCA   and the reasons for judgment of Collier J in Rogers v Asset Loan Co Pty Ltd   FCA                   Notwithstanding the voluminous material in the Statement of Claim  the concern of Mrs Rogers in these proceedings as at December   was directed at obtaining orders in relation to property at Fingal in New South Wales  which had been the subject of orders of the New South Wales Supreme Court in the matter        In the proceedings before me  Mrs Rogers alleged that the respondents were seeking to enforce an improperly obtained consent judgment and writ in respect of the Fingal property  The respondents acknowledged that the judgment entered in the New South Wales Supreme Court did not accord with the terms upon which the respondent in the New South Wales matter  namely Mrs Rogers  consented to judgment being entered against her     I was informed that Mrs Rogers had applied for that judgment to be set aside  and I was told by the respondents that they had agreed to consent to that judgment being set aside     There was no agreement or acknowledgment by or on behalf of the respondents that they would consent to a variation of the judgment in the New South Wales Supreme Court so as to accord with the terms upon which Mrs Rogers had consented to judgment being entered against her     It is in that context that the conduct of Mr Rogers  on behalf of his wife  on   December   has to be judged     Mr Rogers is in error when he asserted  as he did on   October   that   The solicitors for the respondents undertook to  your Honour  not to set aside that fraudulent judgment  but to place in lieu of that judgment  the correct judgment that the deed anticipated    transcript of proceedings  p       Looking at the matter broadly  the allegations of Mrs Rogers in the Statement of Claim filed in

Amended Statement of Claim comprised some   paragraphs     Having regard to the detailed consideration of the allegations in Mr Rogers  proceedings  QUD  it is right to order that these proceedings by Lynne Maree Rogers against each of the respondents be dismissed  and that the applicant pay the respondents  costs of and incidental to those proceedings and the Notices of Motion     In addition to the reasons contained in Collier Js reasons for judgment in proceedings QUD  it should be noted that by a deed of settlement dated   August   Mrs Rogers acknowledged that loan moneys borrowed by Mr Rogers and Living Space Holdings Pty Ltd from Asset Loan Company Pty Ltd had been secured by  amongst other things  guarantees provided by Lynne Rogers  Mrs Rogers had provided security and the registered mortgagee was entitled to pursue its rights pursuant to that mortgage     It seems to me plain that the present Statement of Claim has to be seen against the deliberate decision on Mrs Rogers  behalf on   December   to ask the New South Wales Supreme Court to dismiss her application in respect of the judgment      It is true that the judgment  as recorded  involved a typographical error  which does not reflect the consent given by Mrs Rogers to the making of that judgment  but the offer by the respondents in that proceeding to have the judgment set aside was not acceded to by

offer by the respondents in that proceeding to have the judgment set aside was not acceded to by Mrs Rogers   Collier J noted that the consumer protection provisions of the ASIC Act   called in aid by Mrs Rogers in the present proceeding  replicated those found in the Trade Practices Act and were associated with the transfer of responsibility for consumer protection functions in relation to financial services from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission  She further noted  at   that there were two differences between the application which Mrs Rogers filed in the present proceeding and her application which became the subject of the orders made by Spender J in QUD         First  the substantive application in QUD  purported to be a claim for relief under the Trade Practices Act    Cth  while the proceedings before me purport to be brought under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act    Cth   ASIC Act        Second  whereas in the substantive application before me the applicant seeks as relief an order to set aside a bankruptcy notice filed by the second respondent on the grounds of a set off or counterclaim  and by way of interlocutory relief an order extending time to comply with that bankruptcy notice  no such relief was sought in the substantive application in QUD    Strictly speaking  with respect  there was a third difference  Mr Whittle was not a Respondent to Mrs Rogers  application in QUD   However  the addition of Mr Whittle as a party seems to me to have been quite gratuitous  The omission by her Honour expressly to note this further difference does not detract from the conclusions which she reached as to what ought to be the fate of the present proceeding   Mrs Rogers  contended that her Honour erroneously found that she was a bankrupt  That is incorrect  There is no such finding  What her Honour did find was that Mrs Rogers could be viewed as a proxy for her husband whose bankruptcy inhibited his ability to pursue his alleged grievances against one or more of the Respondents  As the above chronology and a study of the proceedings referred to demonstrate  the temporal connections between the litigation of husband and wife are striking   It is a given that husband and wife are not one in the eyes of the law and that  in relation to the provision of financial services  the ASIC Act confers causes of action that are no longer to be found in the Trade Practices Act   Her Honour did not find to the contrary  Rather  having regard to what were alleged in Mrs Rogers  affidavit to be the underlying facts  matters and circumstances  she was of the opinion that Mrs Rogers was  in substance  attempting to re litigate matters decided by Spender J in QUD   Further and in any event  but again having regard to the reasons for judgment of Spender J in that case  her Honour was also of the view that the calling in aid of the ASIC Act   rather than the Trade Practices Act   would not make Mrs Rogers any more successful  I agree  I regard the remarks made by Spender J at paras     and   of his reasons for judgment in QUD  quoted above  as particularly apposite  In terms of s  A of the Federal Court of Australia Act   Mrs Rogers has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting her latest proceeding citedEbert v The Union
