Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA       CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlGround   for example  alleges a failure to   afford procedural fairness    Section  B of the Migration Act provides that Div   of Pt   of the Act   is taken to be an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matters it deals with    See  SZFDE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   HCA   at       HCA       CLR    One of those requirements is the obligation imposed by s   to invite a person seeking review   to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review    But the manner in which it is said that the Tribunal failed to afford procedural fairness in the present proceeding was not explained and was not readily apparent  The Appellant  for example  appeared before the Tribunal to give evidence and to present her arguments during the course of a hearing held on   March    Prior to that  the Tribunal had written to the Appellant pursuant to s  A of the Migration Act on   February    The Appellant s representative wrote to the Tribunal on   March   and forwarded a further submission on   March    A yet further submission was received on   March    When reference is made in Ground   to the   relevant considerations or integers central   to the claims being advanced  the   integers   are not further identified  Nor has there been any identification of the manner in which the Tribunal   failed to consider   the claims being advanced or was otherwise   preoccupied   for the purposes of Grounds   and    There is no evidence that the Tribunal was   preoccupied   and the detailed elaboration of the claims being advanced and the manner in which they were resolved belie any conclusion other than a conclusion that the Tribunal discharged the functions entrusted to it in a careful and measured fashion  Nor was there any elaboration of the manner in which Grounds     and   were sought to be advanced  Grounds   to   of the Notice of Appeal  inclusive  are rejected affirmedSZKOO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FMCA  http www austlii
