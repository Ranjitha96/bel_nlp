appliedRe BPTC Ltd  in liq      ACSR   The principles which relate to the production of documents for examination of an examinee under the provisions of the Corporations Act were dealt with by Bryson J in Re BPTC Ltd  in liq      ACSR    His Honour referred to earlier authority which recognised the need for a relation between the order for production of documents and the purposes of examining persons under the then s    His Honour also observed at page   that  an  order for production of documents which had the effect of compelling a production of documents which were not required for the examination would       be oppressive    At page   his Honour remarked that it would not be appropriate in the case of a mandatory order directed to a person to perform stated acts that the validity of the order should be saved by some process of severance  He pointed out that it is unlikely the judicial officer who made the order would have intended that some severable part of the order would be valid if other parts of it were not valid  Thus  the contemplation must be that the whole of the order would stand in view of the consequences of failure to comply with such an order   It does seem to me that in light of the observations of Bryson J in Re BPTC there is some force in Mr Thawley s submission that the category of documents sought by   was so broad that it could not have been necessary for the proper conduct of the proposed examination of the affairs of Allstate   Mr Thawley conceded that   included documents relevant to the examinable affairs of Allstate but he submitted that its terms were not confined to relevant documents  I do not accept that the terms of the order were so broad that they extended beyond the examinable affairs of Allstate  Mr Thawley s concession must clearly be correct  particularly in light of the fact that Mr Thawley has not had access to the confidential affidavit which gave rise to the orders of the Registrar made on   September     Mr Lee  for the applicants  submitted that it is plain from the exchange of correspondence and the concession made on   September to which I have referred  that the applicants were prepared to limit the scope of production in a sensible manner  Whilst I think that is correct  nonetheless  it seems to me that in the absence of any actual agreement between the parties to limit the scope of   by the deadline of   September  Mr Trevor and BankWest had to file their applications on that day   In my view  it is plain that Mr Trevor and BankWest needed to obtain an order in terms of   of their interlocutory applications  This is because  without access to the confidential affidavit  it would have been difficult  if not impossible  for them to properly address the Court on the question of whether the production order infringed the principles referred to by Bryson J in Re BPTC    Thus  whether or not an order for access to the confidential affidavit was the primary relief that was sought  it was an essential part of each of the applications and without determining that issue  I cannot determine what the result would have been  It may well be that the result would have been adverse to Mr Thawley

cases nsw supreme ct  html  Different considerations seem to me to apply to an application to set aside an examination summons  In Re Struthers  Liquidator of Project Management  Architecture and Construction  Interior  PACI  Pty Ltd in Liquidation  No      NSWSC         NSWLR   at     Brereton J pointed out that an examination summons in analogous to a subpoena   Both may  in appropriate circumstances  be set aside on the application of the witness or the examinee   The witness or the examinee does not become a party to the proceedings in which the subpoena or the summons is issued  Nonetheless  as his Honour observed at   the Court does have power to make a costs order against persons who are not parties to the proceedings followedRe The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic

costs of Mr Trevor and BankWest be refused consistent with the principles stated by McHugh J in Ex parte Lai Qin   and applied by the Full Court   The appropriate order seems to me to be that there be no order as to costs and I would indicate that I would make the same order in relation to today s application   I certify that the preceding twenty four   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the
