SZFSV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedSZFSV v Minister for Immigration   Anor   FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  This appeal is from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court in SZFSV v Minister for Immigration   Anor   FMCA    The learned Federal Magistrate dismissed the appellant s application to set aside a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal  the Tribunal  the second respondent  made on   July   and posted to the appellant on   August     One of the grounds of the application in the proceeding before the Federal Magistrate was that the Tribunal had failed to consider the application before it in accordance with s   of the Migration Act    Cth   the Migration Act   because it had not provided a hearing for its second consideration of the application for review  The situation was that the Tribunal  constituted by one member  had provided the appellant with a hearing on   January    The member who constituted the Tribunal on that occasion made a decision affirming a decision of the delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs  now the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship  in both cases   the Minister  the first respondent  to refuse to grant to the appellant a protection visa  The appellant applied to the Federal Magistrates Court for orders in respect of that decision  She was unsuccessful and appealed to this Court  At that stage  the appellant and the Minister consented to an order  which was made by Besanko J on   May   allowing the appeal  setting aside the orders of the Federal Magistrates Court made on   January   and ordering that the original decision of the Tribunal be quashed by a writ of certiorari and that a writ of mandamus be issued  directing the Tribunal to  reconsider and determine the matter according to law   The Tribunal then allocated the appellant s application for review of the decision of the Minister s delegate to another member of the Tribunal  On   July   without conducting any further hearing  that member made a decision again affirming the decision not to grant the appellant a protection visa   The appellant again applied to the Federal Magistrates Court  which dismissed her application on   August    Her notice of appeal to this Court from that judgment also raises the question whether the appellant s application to the Tribunal was dealt with in accordance with s   of the Migration Act    It seems to me that this appeal raises an important question of principle  namely whether s   requires the member newly constituting the Tribunal to invite the applicant to appear to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review  when an application has been remitted to the Tribunal to be re determined according to law  consequent upon a decision of the Tribunal having been set aside by the Court  Written submissions have been filed by counsel for the Minister on this appeal  They indicate that there appears to be a conflict of authority as between judgments of single judges of this Court  but there is no clear judgment of the Full Court providing guidance on the application of the relevant principles to such a case   Section  AA b  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  provides a power for a judge in effect to refer to a Full Court an appeal to this Court from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court in a judgment given under the Migration Act   The criterion laid down in that provision is that a judge considers that it is appropriate for the appellate jurisdiction of the Court in relation to an appeal to be exercised by a Full Court  In the present case  I consider it to be appropriate for the appellate jurisdiction of the Court in relation to this appeal to be exercised by a Full Court  because of the importance of the issue of principle  the apparent conflict between judgments of single judges of this Court  and the lack of clear guidance from either the Full Court of this Court or the High Court   Before reaching this conclusion  I invited the appellant to indicate whether she would be badly affected by a delay in the hearing of her appeal  She did not indicate that any bad effect would flow from any delay  It is likely that the appeal will be able to be heard in the course of the Full Court sittings in February     I therefore propose to make an order that the appellate jurisdiction of the Court in relation to this appeal be exercised by a Full Court  I indicate  that because of the importance of the matter and the difficulty of the argument  I propose to grant a certificate pursuant to the scheme in O   of the Federal Court Rules to refer the appellant to counsel  who will be able to argue the matter properly on her behalf without any cost to her   There remains the question of what should happen to the costs of today  In the circumstances of this case  I think that I should make no order as to the costs necessitated by the adjournment of the proceeding  It is normal that these cases are reviewed at an early stage  to see if the appeals ought to be heard by a Full Court or by a single judge  It may be that the importance of the point was not seen clearly when that review was undertaken  Very likely its importance has been underlined by the fact that counsel for the Minister has very properly filed written submissions which lay out the situation as far as the authorities are concerned  In those circumstances it seems to me somewhat unfair to put the appellant at risk of additional costs because the suggestion that the appeal ought to be heard by a Full Court has come from the Court  For those reasons the appropriate order is that there be no order as to costs   The orders I make are as follows       The hearing of the appeal be adjourned to a date to be fixed in the Full Court sittings of the Court in February          The appellate jurisdiction of the Court in relation to the appeal be exercised by a Full Court        There be no order as to the costs of the adjournment
