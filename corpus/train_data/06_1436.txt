Repatriation Commission v Milenz   FCA     November  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlappliedRepatriation Commission v Gosewinckel     ALD   I would note in passing that the subsection s reasonable satisfaction standard is to be applied where the matter in issue is whether or not a veteran actually suffers the injury or disease said to be war caused  see Repatriation Commission v Gosewinckel     ALD   at       It is well accepted that the Tribunal cannot use other evidence  expert or otherwise  to contradict or provide an alternative to the requirements of an SoP  As Weinberg J noted in Repatriation Commission v Gosewinckel at      Section  A and the associated provisions in Part XIA of the VE Act  which include s  B  were introduced in order to take the determination of  purely medical     issues  out of the hands of bodies such as the  Tribunal   appliedRepatriation Commission v Deledio     FCR   The interaction of s   and s  A has been considered in many cases  but most notably in Repatriation Commission v Deledio     FCR   which provided an exposition of the proper application of the provisions which  as in the present matter  is now regularly applied by the Commission and the Tribunal  The four steps the Court identified  at     are often referred to as  the Deledio steps   They are         The Tribunal must consider all the material which is before it and determine whether that material points to a hypothesis connecting the injury  disease or death with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the person  No question of fact finding arises at this stage  If no such hypothesis arises  the application must fail         If the material does raise such a hypothesis  the Tribunal must then ascertain whether there is in force an SoP determined by the Authority under s  B  or             If an SoP is in force  the Tribunal must then form the opinion whether the hypothesis raised is a reasonable one  It will do so if the hypothesis fits  that is to say  is consistent with the  template  to be found in the SoP  The hypothesis raised before it must thus contain one or more of the factors which the Authority has determined to be the minimum which must exist  and be related to the person s service  as required by ss  B d  and  e   If the hypothesis does contain these factors  it could never be said to be contrary to proved or known scientific facts  nor otherwise fanciful  If the hypothesis fails to fit within the template  it will be deemed not to be  reasonable  and the claim will fail        The Tribunal must then proceed to consider under s   whether it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the death was not war caused  or in the case of a claim for incapacity  that the incapacity did not arise from a war caused injury  If not so satisfied  the claim must succeed  If the Tribunal is so satisfied  the claim must fail  It is only at this stage of the process that the Tribunal will be required to find facts from the material before it  In so doing  no question of onus of proof or the application of any presumption will be involved   The appeal is concerned primarily with the third of these steps   Before turning to each of the diseases in issue there is one further matter of a general character to which I need refer  It relates to SoPs  The function of an SoP for s   purposes is to prescribe a medical scientific standard with which a hypothesis must be consistent  Deledio   at    Accentuating the  medical scientific  character of the standards set in the three presently relevant SoPs  the factor or factors which must as a minimum exist before it can be said that a reasonable hypothesis has been raised connecting the relevant disease with a person s service  are all related in some way  usually by time  to the   clinical onset  or the   clinical worsening  of the disease  Diagnostic criteria  or else prescribed symptoms  are in turn specified for each of the diseases   I emphasise the above for this reason  The essence of the Commission s challenge to the Tribunal s reasons in relation both to alcohol abuse and the depressive condition is that the clinical judgment and diagnostic standards prescribed in the two relevant SoPs were simply not made or applied respectively in raising the s   reasonable hypothesis  Because the Tribunal found that the clinical onset of each disease pre dated war service  the relevant factor the SoP in each instance required to exist was tied to  the clinical worsening  of the respective diseases  As will be seen  the proper construction of this formula is central to this appeal   For ease in exposition I will deal separately with the appeal as it relates to each of the three diseases   Though Mr Milenz gave somewhat inconsistent histories of his drinking habits to those who provided expert reports  the evidence clearly established this problem predated both his operational service and the event on HMAS Yarra  In consequence  the Tribunal s focus in par   of the SoP above was upon factor  d   For Deledio step three purposes  the Tribunal was satisfied that a reasonable hypothesis had been raised that  a  Mr Milenz had experienced a  severe psychosocial stressor  in the  action stations  event   b  he suffered from alcohol abuse   c  there was material pointing to alcohol abuse existing prior to operational service being worsened by service  and  d  the hypothesis was consistent with the template in the SoP   For the purposes of Deledio step four  the Tribunal was satisfied that  i  the psychosocial stressor was an identifiable event that evoked feelings of distress in Mr Milenz  Reasons   and  ii  there had been a clinical worsening of the alcohol abuse  Reasons    As to the latter  it commented at      The history of alcohol consumption is confusing and inconsistent  however  it was consumed prior to operational service  On occasions the quantity was immodest  But after operational service  the quantity  type and frequency of alcohol consumed was far greater  It follows that there has been a clinical worsening of alcohol abuse  The worsening  in my view is referable to him having experienced a severe stressor  as defined and within two years of the worsening  There was an event which objectively did occur and from which Mr Milenz suffered a subjective reaction  His increased alcohol consumption was an element of that reaction  emphasis added   In consequence the Tribunal was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Commission had established that the condition of alcohol abuse was not war caused   Three psychiatrists  Drs Percival  Ratnayake and Strauss provided reports for the Commission and two of them  Drs Percival and Strauss  gave brief oral evidence  Mr Milenz did not call any medical witnesses citedLees v Repatriation Commission   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The question whether a disease as defined in a SoP has clinically worsened is a medical one  raising as it does a diagnostic question  I have emphasised  as defined  for the reason that the clinical worsening must be of the disease having the features  symptoms and manifestations prescribed in the relevant SoP s definition  cf Lees v Repatriation Commission   FCAFC         FCR   at    citedRepatriation Commission v Cornelius   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  As I have already indicated  the definition of  alcohol abuse  provides its own diagnostic criteria  I need not repeat them here  These contrive the inquiry to be undertaken by a doctor in determining for the purposes of the SoP whether the disease is  or was  present at a particular time  cf Repatriation Commission v Cornelius   FCA   at     or whether that disease  being present  had worsened  In other words  to use the language of the definition  the worsening is in the  clinically significant impairment or distress  which resulted from the maladaptive pattern of alcohol abuse and which  importantly for present purposes  was  manifested  in one or more of the prescribed ways within a   month period   What is clear  in my view  is that the Tribunal misconstrued what was comprehended by the clinical worsening requirement of par  d  of the SoP  That requirement imposed a medical scientific standard  not a lay standard  Though the Tribunal found a clinical worsening of Mr Milenz s alcohol abuse  it did not address whether there was a worsening in the disease as defined and manifest  It simply inferred a worsening because   after operational service  the quantity  type and frequency of alcohol consumed was far greater   These are not features or manifest symptoms of the disease defined in par  b  of the SoP   The consequence of the Tribunal so treating par  d  is that the actual hypothesis it considered was pointed to on the material before it was not one upheld by the SoP  For this reason the decision as it relates to alcohol abuse must be set aside citedSanta Sabina College v Minister for Education     ALR   The course pressed on me is not one I am prepared to take  I do not speculate on the likely fate of Mr Milenz s claim on a rehearing particularly given the standard of proof provisions of the VE Act  He is entitled to have his case put again to the Tribunal  It is possible that it might come to a result favourable to him  cf Santa Sabina College v Minister for Education     ALR   at     The appeal in relation to this condition can be dealt with relatively briefly as it raises the same general issue as that considered in relation to alcohol abuse   Only one of the three psychiatrists  Dr Strauss  diagnosed Mr Milenz as having a depressive disorder  Such views as the other two had on whether Mr Milenz suffered from a depressive anxiety condition of some variety had no relevance either to the condition found by the Tribunal or to the SoP applying to it  That SoP  No   of   concerned  Depressive Disorder
