Those principles were recently endorsed in Concrete Pty Ltd v Parramatta Design   Developments Pty Ltd   HCA         ALR   at   per Kirby and Crennan JJ citedEbner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The principles relevant to disqualification by reason of apprehended bias are set out in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ  McHugh  Gummow and Hayne JJ in Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy   HCA         CLR   at       Where  in the absence of any suggestion of actual bias  a question arises as to the independence or impartiality of a judge      a judge is disqualified if a fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide  That principle gives effect to the requirement that justice should both be done and be seen to be done  a requirement which reflects the fundamental importance of the principle that the tribunal be independent and impartial  It is convenient to refer to it as the apprehension of bias principle      The apprehension of bias principle may be thought to find its justification in the importance of the basic principle  that the tribunal be independent and impartial  So important is the principle that even the appearance of departure from it is prohibited lest the integrity of the judicial system be undermined  There are  however  some other aspects of the apprehension of bias principle which should be recognised  Deciding whether a judicial officer  or juror  might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of a question that has not been determined requires no prediction about how the judge or juror will in fact approach the matter  The question is one of possibility  real and not remote  not probability  Similarly  if the matter has already been decided  the test is one which requires no conclusion about what factors actually influenced the outcome  No attempt need be made to inquire into the actual thought processes of the judge or juror      The apprehension of bias principle admits of the possibility of human frailty  Its application is as diverse as human frailty  Its application requires two steps  First  it requires the identification of what it is said might lead a judge  or juror  to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits  The second step is no less important  There must be an articulation of the logical connection between the matter and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the case on its merits   footnotes omitted citedGamaethige v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  To the extent that the
