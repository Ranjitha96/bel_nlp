Australian Securities   Investments Commission v McDougall   FCA     April  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlconsideredAustralian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd     ACSR   In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd     ACSR   at     Pegasus   Davies AJ addressed the question whether the sole director of the company which promoted and operated a managed investment scheme should also be considered to be a person operating the scheme  His Honour said at        The word  operate  is an ordinary word of the English language and  in the context  should be given its meaning in ordinary parlance  The term is not used to refer to ownership or proprietorship but rather to the acts which constitute the management of or the carrying out of the activities which constitute the managed investment scheme  The Oxford English Dictionary gives these relevant meanings         To effect or produce by action or the exertion of force or influence  to bring about  accomplish  work       To cause or actuate the working of  to work  a machine  etc   Chiefly U S       To direct the working of  to manage  conduct  work  a railway  business  etc  to carry out or through  direct to an end  a principle  an undertaking  etc  orig  U S        I have concluded that Mr McKim operated the managed investment scheme  He was the living person who formulated and directed the scheme and he was actively involved in its day to day operations  He supervised others in their performance      I have also concluded that Mr McKim is not exempted by s ED   He did not  merely  act as agent or employee of Pegasus  He was the directing mind and will of Pegasus and of the scheme   Mansfield J reached a similar conclusion in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v McNamara     ACSR    In that case  the individual in question was one of the directors of the company managing the scheme  His Honour found that the person in question formulated and directed the scheme  and was actively involved in its day to day operations as the directing mind and will of the company managing the scheme  Accordingly  he was operating the scheme in contravention of s  EB   In making these findings  Mansfield J approved the passage in Pegasus to which I have referred   Since Australian Softwood Forest Pty Ltd v Attorney General  NSW     HCA         CLR   esp at   the courts have recognised that the grant of declaratory relief on the application of a statutory body such as ASIC may serve important

ASIC is charged with the administration and enforcement of the Act   and there will be many cases where it is in the public interest for the courts to make a declaration on ASIC s application that the

the court thinks appropriate   These words echo the concluding words of s   of the Trade Practices Act    TPA  which state that the Court may grant an injunction in such terms as the Court determines to be appropriate  These words were introduced into s   by a   amendment to the TPA  which  to adapt the language used by French J in OD Transport Pty Ltd v WA Government Railways Commission     FCR   at   freed the power conferred by s   from the previous constraint that the injunction granted under it must restrain a person from engaging in conduct that constitutes or would constitute a contravention of Part IV of Part V of the TPA or one of the species of accessorial participation there listed   French J said that s   was a widely drawn remedial provision which was available to restrain conduct which may infringe upon the public interest by contravening the provisions of the TPA in Part IV and Part V  His Honour added at      There is room within the statutory framework and the policy that underlies it for an injunction which is intended not to restrain an apprehended repetition of contravening conduct but to deter an offender from repeating the offence  That deterrence is effected by attaching to the repetition of the contravention the range of sanctions available for contempt of court  The possibility remains open  by virtue of s     that after a suitable period unmarked by further contravention the party restrained may apply to the court to rescind the order      The remedy is flexible and may be applied in service of a variety of functions to support the policy of the Act   This was a proper case for the grant of that relief  consideredICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission     FCR   The operation of s   of the TPA was canvassed by the Full Court of this Court in ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission     FCR     ICI    Lockhart J described s   as a public interest provision which attracts special considerations  it represents a primary means of ensuring compliance with commercial regulation legislation  at      After referring to subss   and   Lockhart J said       Injunctions are traditionally employed to restrain repetition of conduct  A statutory provision that enables an injunction to be granted to prevent the commission of conduct that has never been done before and is not likely to be done again is a statutory enlargement of traditional equitable principles  But this is because traditional doctrine surrounding the grant of injunctive relief was developed primarily for the protection of private proprietary rights  Public interest injunctions are different  Parts IV and V of the Act involve matters of high public policy  Parts IV and V relate to practices and conduct that legislatures throughout the world in different forms and to different degrees  have decided are contrary to the public interest  contracts  arrangements or understandings affecting competition adversely  s   the misuse of market power  s     the practice of exclusive dealing  s     resale price maintenance  s     price discrimination  s     anti competitive mergers  s   and unfair practices with respect to consumers  Pt V   These are legislative enactments of matters vital to the presence of free competition and enterprise and a just society      In his Honour s view  the section would in an appropriate case authorise the Court to grant an injunction against a respondent preventing him in engaging in conduct which is similar to the conduct which constituted  or would constitute  a contravention of the Act   at    Lockhart J also agreed  at   with the reasoning of Barwick CJ in Mikasa  NSW  Pty Ltd v Festival Stores   HCA         CLR   at   that in an appropriate case the court may grant an injunction to restrain the respondent from engaging in the practice of resale price maintenance notwithstanding that only some of the acts falling within s   were found to have been so committed   In ACCC v Z Tek Computer Pty Ltd     FCR   at   at  D   E  after referring to these passages in ICI   Merkel J said     The width of the power conferred by s   and its public interest character obviously give the Court great amplitude in determining appropriate injunctive orders in a particular case  However there are limitations on the Court s power under the section  Confinement of the power by reference to the scope and purpose of the TPA  and in particular s     is one limitation on the power  However  there are at least two further limitations  The power to make orders under s   is only enlivened in a proceeding which alleges that there has been a contravention of a provision of Pt IV   IVA or V of the TPA  As was said by Gummow J in ICI at   the terms of an injunction granted under s   must  on their face  operate upon a range of conduct which has  the relationship required by s   with contravention of the Act   Irrespective of whether the injunction is sought or granted under s   or    AA  there must be a nexus between the conduct alleged or found to constitute the relevant contraventions and the injunctions granted   Most recently  in Foster v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCAFC     a Full Court  comprising Ryan  Finn and Allsop JJ  noted the apparent tension between the view expressed by Lockhart and Gummow JJ in ICI   Their Honours said at        His Honour s reference to terms having  an operation outside the boundaries of s     is no more than a paraphrase of the actual words of the subsection  such terms as the Court determines to be appropriate   That paraphrase  we consider with respect  does not illuminate the amplitude which should be given  as a matter of construction  to the grant of power  In our view  a more helpful guide to resolving the question of construction is afforded by this observation  also from ICI v Trade Practices Commission   of Lockhart J  with whom French J agreed  at          In my opinion subss   and   are designed to ensure that once the condition precedent to the exercise of injunctive relief has been satisfied  ie contraventions or proposed contraventions of Pt IV or V of the Act   the court should be given the widest possible injunctive powers  devoid of traditional constraints  though the power must be exercised judicially and sensibly           This approach of Lochkhart J accords with the view often expressed by the High Court that discretions or powers entrusted to Courts should be read liberally for the relevant statutory purpose  without making

Real Estate Institute  WA    FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  It is implicit in Merkel J s judgment that an injunction under s   may extend beyond the specific conduct proven to constitute a contravention by s   and may  in appropriate cases  extend to conduct of the same kind or class  There must  however  be a sufficient nexus or relationship between the conduct that is the subject of the restraint and the conduct that was alleged to constitute a contravention of the Act   As French J pointed out in ACCC v Real Estate Institute  WA    FCA         FCR   at   the question whether there is a sufficient nexus between the orders sought and the contraventions alleged involves an evaluative judgment by the Court which will depend heavily upon the circumstances of the particular case discussedFoster v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  Most recently  in Foster v Australian

    ALR   at         Thus  the Full Court preferred the wider view described by Lockhart and French JJ in ICI to the narrower view which the appellant in Foster sought to found upon the judgment of Gummow J   The issue in Foster was whether an injunction that restrained the fourth respondent from being directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in the promotion or conduct of a business of a specified kind for a period of five years went beyond the power conferred by s   of the TPA  As the Full Court explained  this turned on the existence of a sufficient nexus between a contravention that enlivened the Court s power under s   and the conduct that was restrained by the injunction     In our view  the need  suggested by the authorities  for a nexus between the contravention of the Act which the Court has found and the terms of the restraint which it then decides to impose is a specific reflection of Lockhart J s insistence that the power be exercised  judicially and sensibly   It goes to the appropriateness of the relief contemplated by the concluding words of s     not to the extent of the power to grant it  If the Court considers that a complete prohibition  whether permanently or for a specified period  on a respondent s engaging in a particular field of commercial activity or industry is required to protect the public from conduct of the kind which constituted the contravention  s   is wide enough to support such a prohibition as a matter of power  This analysis of s   conforms  we consider  with that recently undertaken by Goldberg J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dermalogica Pty Ltd     ALR   at          The Full Court held that there was an appropriate nexus  as the evidence and the trial judge s findings at first instance gave rise to a real fear that the fourth respondent would  unless restrained  commit further conduct of the same general kind  In these circumstances  it was appropriate to cast the injunction more widely in order to catch conduct which was similar to the established contravention  at   and     In the present case  I consider that the wider form of injunctive relief is appropriate  especially given the evidence that McDougall attempted to resuscitate the Scheme in another form  The evidence demonstrates  in my view  that the defendants are susceptible to repeating their contraventions of the managed investment provisions of the Act   There is  in my opinion  a sufficient nexus between the wider form of injunctive order sought by ASIC in par   of the draft orders  and the contraventions of the Act which were established by the evidence in this case  The wider form of injunction is consented to by the defendants  In all the circumstances  I consider that the wider form of injunction is warranted  and that it will serve the public interest   ASIC seeks orders that the Scheme be wound up pursuant to s  EE  of the Act   A number of ancillary orders are sought  including an order appointing the existing Court appointed receivers as joint and several liquidators of the Scheme  The defendants consent to these orders being made  I have made two minor alterations to the form of the draft orders for the winding up of the Scheme  The first alteration  in par   identifies Adrian Lawrence Brown and James Henry Stewart as the receivers appointed by order of Merkel J on   October    The second alteration clarifies that the receivers referred to in par   are the individuals identified in the above par   of the orders citedAustralian Securities and Investments Commission v Takaran Pty Ltd  No       ALR   In ASIC v Takaran Pty Ltd  No       ALR   at     at   Barrett J made the following observation  with which I agree     The fact that a scheme is being operated by its existing operators in contravention of statute activates a public interest in favour of not only its being wound up under s  EE   Australian Securities and Investments Commission v McNamara     ACSR   but also  ensuring the transparency of the winding up process and the safeguarding of the rights of the contributories  by committing the winding up to an independent
