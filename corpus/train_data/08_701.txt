Korean Air Lines v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission  No     FCA     May  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlfollowedAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission v Rural Press Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  This approach is consistent with that expressed by Mansfield J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Rural Press Ltd   FCA         FCR   at         Accepting therefore that the exercise of the power is confined to the purpose stated by Deane J  the question then is whether it follows from the concessions made by Mr Pearson that the Notice was issued other than for the administrative function of determining whether proceedings should be instituted   It is true that Mr Pearson accepted that the information sought by the Notice does not go to establishing any element of a breach of the provisions of s  a  or  b  of the Act  But  in my opinion  it does not follow that the decision to issue and serve the Notice was for an improper purpose  There are two reasons for this   Fourth  in Rural Press at   Mansfield J agreed with the view expressed by Lockhart J in Kotan   Mansfield J went on at   to say that the question of whether the power has been exercised for an improper purpose is a matter to be decided in all the circumstances  I respectfully agree with this observation   The short answer to KAL s submission is that the evidence before me demonstrates that the purpose of the ACCC in deciding to issue the Notice was to obtain evidence of the extent of any contraventions by KAL and evidence going to the quantum of any penalty  All of this might ultimately be used in the event that the ACCC decides to commence proceedings  This purpose falls  squarely within the Act  Rural Press at     Reference was made in cross examination of Mr Pearson to the ACCC s knowledge of difficulties encountered in obtaining an order for discovery and interrogatories in existing proceedings  It has not been demonstrated that this was an actuating purpose in the decision to serve the Notice   The application will be dismissed  I will hear the parties briefly on the question of costs     I

J considered that s  g  will apply where the Court would be likely to be misled as to the existence or contents of an excluded communication where those matters are in issue in the proceedings  see also Bloss Holdings Pty Ltd v Brackley Industries Pty Ltd   NSWSC   at    discussedBrambles Holdings Ltd v Trade Practices Commission  No       FLR   Nor  in my view  does the statement of Franki J in Brambles Holdings Ltd v Trade Practices Commission  No       FLR   at   support the view that the power automatically ceases when the proceedings have been commenced   It seems to me that the effect of what Franki J said was captured in the words of Gibbs CJ in Pioneer Concrete at      Thus  if the power were used to assist a party in proceedings already pending  in a way that would confer an advantage which the procedures of the Court would otherwise deny  there would be a contempt  however  not every investigation into facts the subject of an existing proceeding constitutes a contempt   In any event  whether or not the question of law is decided favourably to KAL  the contention fails at the factual level because I am not satisfied that the ACCC had decided to commence proceedings   Ultimately  Mr Gageler conceded that there was no decision by the ACCC to commence proceedings and he accepted that there was no recommendation to the ACCC that proceedings be commenced  However  he adhered to the submission that  as at   October   there had for some time been a very firm intention  contemplation or expectation that proceedings would be commenced subject only to the ACCC being satisfied of the sufficiency of evidence of a contravention of s   followedBrown v Commissioner of Taxation     ALR   It is implicit in the remarks of Emmett J in Brown v Commissioner of Taxation

Wales   HCA         CLR   at     Glengallen Investments Pty Ltd v Arthur Anderson     Qd R   at     The statutory requirement that the communication be  in connection with an attempt to negotiate a

incidental to negotiations followedFirst Capital Partners Pty Ltd v Sylvatech Ltd     FLR   Nor is there any substance in the suggestion that the privilege does not apply because the  dispute

toGlengallen Investments Pty Ltd v Arthur Anderson     Qd R   I do not consider that this confines the nature of the dispute to one which is the subject of existing proceedings  To do so would be

negotiations  GPI Leisure Corporation Ltd  In Liq  v Yuill     NSWLR   at     Mr Owbridge s proposal to Mr Lloyd fell within this description   Two requirements must be satisfied for an otherwise privileged communication to fall within the exception stated in s  g   First  other evidence must have already been adduced which would be likely to mislead the court unless evidence of the without prejudice communication is adduced referred toHarrington v Lowe     CLR   The position at common law was that the privilege operated even where litigation had not yet commenced and extended to a

 CLR   Nor do I consider that the principle in Jones v Dunkel     CLR   is enlivened by the failure of the ACCC to call Mr Samuel or the members of staff who prepared the Reason to Believe paper  There are limits on the use which can be made of Jones v Dunkel in administrative law proceedings  This is not a case in which the inferences sought to be drawn by KAL would be hard to resist in the absence of evidence from the author of the documents  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia   HCA         CLR   at           and Singh v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA         FCR   at      KAL relied on a number of matters to support an inference that the purpose for which the Notice was issued was an improper one  namely that the ACCC believed it may not be able to obtain the information through the Court s processes once it had commenced proceedings appliedKotan Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission     FCR   Other decisions of the Full Court of the Federal Court are to the same effect as the statement of principle of Deane J in Pioneer Concrete  see Kotan Holdings Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission     FCR   at   per Davies and Foster JJ  Seven Network Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission   FCAFC         FCR   at   per Sackville and Emmett JJ   Second  as Lockhart J observed in Kotan at   the use of s   for the purpose of obtaining evidence to be tendered in penalty proceedings on the question of the quantum of any penalty is a legitimate use of the power  This view is consistent with the observation of Mason J in Pioneer Concrete at   that the discharge of the Commission s administrative functions under the Act        include the investigation of alleged breaches  the acquisition of information and the obtaining of evidence for submission to the Court in proceedings in respect of a contravention   KAL s contention that the power to issue the Notice had ceased  or was  spent  depends upon whether I am satisfied that the ACCC had decided  either formally or informally  to commence proceedings against KAL at the time when the decision was made to issue the Notice   An affirmative answer to that question would not necessarily lead to a finding that the power was spent  This is because a question of law would then arise as to whether a decision by the ACCC to institute proceedings against KAL bars it from thereafter exercising the power to issue a notice under s   of the Act   The question of law is a debateable one  It cannot rise above the statement of Davies and Foster JJ in Kotan at   that there may be an arguable case that the power to issue a s   notice ceases when the Commission has formally resolved that legal proceedings be commenced  But there are other indications that this proposition does not accurately state the law   First  Davies and Foster JJ thought the preferable view to be to the contrary  Second  Lockhart J was inclined to the view that the power to issue a notice under s   does not end and is not abused merely because the Commission has made a decision to institute proceedings against the addressee of a proposed notice  His Honour went on to say that whether the power to issue a notice is abused is a question of fact to be determined in all of the circumstances  Kotan at     Third  Lockhart J s view is supported by the observations of French J in Shannahan v Trade Practices Commission   FCA         FCR   at     See also French J at first instance in Re Kotan Holdings Pty Ltd   Ors v Trade Practices Commission   FCA         ATPR     at      His Honour said that there is nothing in the terms  context or purpose of s   to indicate that the power is compromised by the Commission having decided to commence proceedings   Fourth  in Rural Press at   Mansfield J agreed with the view expressed by Lockhart J in Kotan   Mansfield J went on at   to say that the question of whether the power has been exercised for an improper purpose is a matter to be decided in all the circumstances  I respectfully agree with this observation   In any event  officers of the ACCC do not have power to institute proceedings  Kotan at      This is not a case in which it has been demonstrated that the principle stated in Carltona Ltd v Commissioner of Works     All ER   has any application  see also O Reilly v Commissioners of the State Bank of Victoria   HCA         CLR   at     In my opinion  this distinction supports the view expressed in Kotan because it reaffirms the principle that it is only the Commissioners who have the power to institute proceedings distinguishedMoran v Moran  No     NSWSC  http www austlii edu au au cases nsw supreme ct  html  KAL submitted that the evidence of the conversation was admissible under s  g  because  without it  I would have only part of the picture in respect of an important aspect of KAL s case  Moran v Moran  No     NSWSC   at     However  in my view  that is not the whole of the test which is stated in s  g  and  ultimately  The high watermark of KAL s attack on the validity of the Notice is to be found in the concessions which Mr Gageler obtained from Mr Pearson and to which I referred in the introduction  The essential point which arises is whether  in light of Mr Pearson s concession that the information sought in the Notice is not required to establish a contravention of s  a  or  b  it can nevertheless be said that the power was exercised for the purpose for which it was conferred   The answer to this question turns upon a consideration of the authorities on the ambit of the power and upon Mr Pearson s other evidence referred toO Reilly v Commissioners of the State Bank of Victoria   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In any event  officers

reiterated that view in Pioneer Concrete at    Sheppard J agreed with both the Chief Justice and Deane J referred toRodgers v Rodgers   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html

Rodgers v Rodgers   HCA         CLR   at   Harrington v Lowe     CLR   at   Glengallen at     followedTrade Practices Commission v Arnotts Ltd     ALR   Here  it is sufficiently clear from the terms of the conversation between Mr Owbridge and Mr Lloyd and the background which I have recounted that there was a likelihood of litigation if the settlement proposal was not accepted  In my view  that was sufficient to constitute a  dispute  for the purposes of s  a  and s  a  of the Evidence Act   Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts Ltd     ALR   at       The effect of the authorities at common law is that the privilege applies to offers to negotiate and expressions of willingness to do so  it is not necessary that there be an offer capable of acceptance  Trade Practices Commission v Arnotts at     discussedTrade Practices Commission v Pioneer Concrete  Vic  Pty Ltd     FLR   KAL therefore submitted that the purpose for which the Notice was issued exceeded the limits of the power to issue a Notice under s    The clearest statement of the principle which underlies KAL s attack on the decision to issue the Notice is to be found in the words of Deane J in Trade Practices Commission v Pioneer Concrete  Vic  Pty Ltd     FLR   at     In the relevant passage from Deane J s judgment  his Honour said that the power conferred under s   is to be used only for the purpose       of the performance by the Commission of the administrative function of determining whether proceedings should be instituted by the Commission     KAL contends that this principle is infringed so as to enliven the grounds of review stated in ss  d   e  and  c  of the ADJR Act    However  this contention must of course be looked at in light of the evidence as a whole  including in particular other evidence given by Mr Pearson as to the circumstances which existed at the time when the decision to issue the Notice was made   A consideration of the authorities supports the view of Deane J in the Full Federal Court of the Federal Court in Pioneer Concrete that the power is to be used only for the performance of the administrative function of determining whether proceedings should be instituted
