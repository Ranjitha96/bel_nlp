 IN THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA   NEW SOUTH WALES DISTRICT REGISTRY TAD   OF     ON APPEAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL CONSTITUTED BY ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR DAVIS   BETWEEN  DAVID JOHN RHODES   Applicant AND  AUSTRALIAN FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY   Respondent   JUDGE  CONTI J DATE OF ORDER    SEPTEMBER   WHERE MADE  SYDNEY   THE COURT ORDERS THAT    The application for review by way of appeal from the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal made on   July   be dismissed  In reaching those conclusions  it becomes perhaps unnecessary for me to consider  in the circumstances postulated by Mr Rhodes  the scope of operation of the general law relating to the formation and promulgation of Ministerial policy as a guide to the exercise of administrative discretion  Nevertheless I would record in that context the principles restated by Brennan J  as then President of the AAT  in Re Drake and Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  No       ALD   at   as follows      are powerful considerations in favour of a Minister adopting a guiding policy  It can serve to focus attention on the purpose which the exercise of the discretion is calculated to achieve  and thereby to assist the Minister and others to see more clearly  in each case  the desirability of exercising the power in one way or another  Decision making is facilitated by the guidance given by an adopted policy  and the integrity of decision making in particular cases is the better assured if decisions can be tested against such a policy can diminish the inconsistencies which might otherwise appear in a series of decisions  and enhance the sense of satisfaction with the fairness and continuity of the administrative process      course  a policy must be consistent with the statute  It must allow the Minister to take into account the relevant circumstances  it must not require him to take into account irrelevant circumstances  and it must not serve a purpose foreign to the purpose for which the discretionary power was created  A policy which contravenes these criteria would be inconsistent with the statute     Reference may also be made in that regard to Minister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethnic Affairs v Gray     FCR   at   where French and Drummond JJ  referring to Re Drake  observed as follows      place of government policy in the Tribunal s decision making will depend upon the interests of good government and consistent decision making on the one hand and the ideal of justice in the individual case on the other  But its decision must be the result of an independent assessment of all the circumstances of the particular case and not the uncritical application of policy  Purportedly by way of reply  Mr Rhodes contended that AFMA did  not point to any properly articulated statement as to what is said to be its  limited entry  policy  in a form that the AAT or this Court can properly assess such a policy      as being lawful by reference to the structure and operation of the  Management Act  and     as being applicable to the circumstances of Mr Rhodes        I do not think that to be correct  In any event  upon that somewhat sweeping and unspecific footing  Mr Rhodes contended that  t here is therefore no policy within the scope of Drake   and further that  t o the extent such a policy might be implied from various matters found in the evidence    such a policy when properly construed does not treat  Mr Rhodes  as a  new entrant  in any relevant sense   I have difficulty in distilling the implications of either contention  The policy is articulated or reflected both explicitly and implicitly for instance in the provisions of sections  j  and    The objective circumstances were that Mr Rhodes did not tender payment of the management levy of     at any material time  his fishing permit relating to the period of time from   March   to   December   was suspended on   May   and cancelled on   July    After those events had occurred  Mr Rhodes merely forwarded to AFMA a form of application for fishing permit  and did so without any tender of payment of fees  It was next asserted by Mr Rhodes that  n othing can be taken from the events prior to the OCS arrangements   to   in relation to boat and net numbers as affecting  Mr Rhodes  and that  w hatever policy may have been in place  it was expressly overridden by the OCS transfer of jurisdiction from Tasmania to the Commonwealth   The first limb of that assertion was not seemingly supported in relation to either boat numbers or fish net numbers  and the second limb purportedly propounded a proposition without any apparent  much less reasoned  support  It was then asserted by Mr Rhodes that  OCS arrangements required the Commonwealth to treat Tasmanian fishermen on a fair and equitable basis with Commonwealth fishers  and further that the same  expressly permitted Tasmanian Shark Gill Net and Hook fishermen to apply for a Commonwealth fishing concession   Those provisions originated in the Memorandum of Understanding of   November   clause  g  thereof reading as follows      ensuring individual fishers in a fishery  who come under the Commonwealth s jurisdiction as a result of OCS arrangements  are treated on a fair and equitable basis with all other fishers in the school shark and gummy shark fishery  However that opportunity for equal participation was not open ended at least in the sense of accommodating prospective or aspirational entrants  Thus clause   of the Memorandum of Understanding  under the sub heading  Commonwealth School Shark and Gummy Shark Management  required  listed fishers  within   days  from notification  to apply for a Commonwealth shark fishing concession    and clause   thereof recorded that  AFMA has taken a decision  in accordance with its legislative objectives  that school shark and gummy shark will be managed by determining the total allowable catch    of each species  allocating the Commonwealth component of the TAC to individual Commonwealth fishing concession holders as individual quota and making this individual quota transferable   Moreover clause   stipulated for  t he initial allocation mechanism to apportion the TAC of school shark and gummy shark    sectors within the Southern Shark Fishery  and for      the appropriate formula e  for the allocation of Individual Transferable Quotas    for school shark and gummy shark amongst Southern Shark Fishery permit holders within each of the sectors       pursuant to recommendation  by an independent allocation advisory panel  which was charged with the task of recommending a result which ensures that all operators in the fishery are treated on a fair and equitable basis in the allocation process       However so much did not declare or envisage contextually that the allocation process would remain open to newcomers  if otherwise qualified to apply as  licensed fishers    subsequent to the operation of  t he initial allocation mechanism   discussedMinister for Immigration  Local Government and Ethnic Affairs v Gray     FCR  Rhodes v Australian Fisheries Management Authority   FCA

AND  AUSTRALIAN FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY   Respondent   JUDGE  CONTI J DATE OF ORDER    SEPTEMBER   WHERE MADE  SYDNEY   THE COURT ORDERS THAT    The application for review by way of appeal from the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal made on   July   be dismissed  Nevertheless  so the submissions of Mr Rhodes continued   the OCS Memorandum of Understanding contemplates the fishery will be managed by determination of total allowable catch for quota species  allocation of that TAC quota to permit holders and making such quota transferable    Mr Rhodes referring generally again to clauses   to   of the Memorandum of Understanding of   November   and to page   of the Southern Shark Fishery   Management Arrangements of January   appearing under the heading  Is Quota Transferable   That begs the issue as to restrictions imposed elsewhere in relation to the permit holders to be the subject of such allocations  It was submitted further by Mr Rhodes in the present context that  a part from the   Management Plan and the OCS arrangements  there was no evidence before the AAT of any promulgated policy of the Minister or AFMA to refuse applications for fishing permits in the SESS Fishery  it was said by Mr Rhodes in that regard that      cases such as Re Green and Australian Fisheries Management Authority   AATA         ALD   are distinguishable   To provide a brief key to an understanding of the ratio in Re Green  I extract below the headnote  which would at least not seem to lend support to Mr Rhodes  contention in that regard      relevant AFMA policy did not have the status of Ministerial policy  or policy adopted by a body such as the Australian Fisheries Council comprising the relevant Commonwealth and state ministers  However  the policy was settled and adopted by the AFMA board after consultation with key stakeholders  and should be given great weight by the tribunal and should be applied unless it was unlawful or unless there were cogent reasons militating against its application in the circumstances of the particular case  It was acknowledged by Mr Rhodes that  w hen determining the quota to be allocated to individual fishing permits  considerations of management by way of the TAC  ie total allowable catch  quota  and environmental concerns invoking the precautionary principle  may well be relevant  and I was referred in that regard to AFMA s letter of   November   to Mr Rhodes  which concluded with AFMA s statement of an inability      to reinstate your fishing permit     to which letter I have already referred in some detail  However there additionally appeared in that letter the further statement that  l  imiting the number of operators in a fishery has been widely adopted through the world as a necessary first step in any management of fisheries resources    AFMA furthermore cited  Technical Guidelines for responsible fisheries     being a United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation s   publication  which contained reference to the factor that      limited access is widely considered to be essential for efficient and responsible fisheries    In the same context  AFMA further cited the    Inter governmental Agreement on the Environment    entered into by the Commonwealth  State and Territory Governments in Australia  where in par       the following appeared      there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage  lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation      It was in the context essentially of what I have summarised in the present segment of these reasons that Mr Rhodes contended boldly that  i t was inconsistent with the objectives of the  Management Act  the SESS Management Plan and the OCS arrangements to refuse Mr Rhodes  application on the basis that he was  at the time of the application  not the holder of a current permit   I have experienced considerable difficulty in distilling any such themes of assistance from those materials in favour of Mr Rhodes  contentions propounded by counsel  and which I have sought to summarise or reproduce in these reasons discussedLegione v Hateley   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  htmlRhodes v Australian Fisheries Management Authority   FCA     September       Home

  ON APPEAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL CONSTITUTED BY ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR DAVIS   BETWEEN  DAVID JOHN RHODES   Applicant AND  AUSTRALIAN FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY   Respondent   JUDGE  CONTI J DATE OF ORDER    SEPTEMBER   WHERE MADE  SYDNEY   THE COURT ORDERS THAT    The application for review by way of appeal from the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal made on   July   be dismissed  It was in the context of those levy and charge collection provisions of the Management Act that Mr Rhodes further submitted that  w here the Act has expressly provided for the penalty to be imposed for failure to pay a levy  it is an improper exercise of power by AFMA  to  seek to impose a further penalty on Mr Rhodes by refusing to issue him a new permit  and further that  h ad Parliament intended that cancellation of a permit be permanent  it would have made specific provision to that effect   It was further submitted by Mr Rhodes that  t he cost recovery argument also ignores the ability of AFMA under section   to impose conditions on the issue of a permit  and further that  i f there are outstanding levies or other obligations  the permit could be made conditional upon the applicant first discharging his outstanding levy obligations   Whether a logical stopping place in terms of viable and convenient economic management may be articulated in support of that contention must be at least difficult to encapsulate  It is a common feature of contractual remedies of cancellation of entire contractual rights on default of payment of a liquidated sum that the same crystallise ipso facto   and are exercisable subject to whatever formalities of notice may be stipulated by the governing contract or any statutory stipulation  Treating the failure to pay levies as fatal to Mr Rhodes  application was said by Mr Rhodes in any event to misconstrue the discretion vested in AFMA under s   of the Management Act  that being described as not a matter of cost recovery but effecting in substance a forfeiture which in private law would give rise to relief for unconscionable conduct  Qualification for relief of that kind would normally be at least formidable  Mr Rhodes invoked the decision of the High Court in Legione v Hateley   HCA         CLR   but the analogy is hardly in kilter  That well known High Court authority concerning relief against forfeiture related to a purchaser by instalments originally of vacant land  in circumstances where the purchaser erected subsequently a home on the land at a time when the land had not been fully paid for  and hence in circumstances where upon termination of the contract for default in payment of the purchase price for the vacant land   the vendors will receive an ill merited windfall   per Gibbs CJ and Murphy J at    In my opinion the loss of the statutory privilege in the nature of the present fishing permit by reason of non payment of periodic levies geared to the continuance on foot of the permit would not constitute sufficient analogy with the principles of the general law concerning forfeiture of property or proprietary rights in circumstances where the statutory entity gains no proprietary or pecuniary advantage and is merely enabled or assisted to perform its statutory functions and obligations discussedMobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR

COURT ORDERS THAT    The application for review by way of appeal from the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal made on   July   be dismissed  This further issue was raised by Mr Rhodes by way of challenge to the exercise by AFMA of its power of cancellation of Mr Rhodes  fishing permit for reasons of so called  non payment of fees or levies  it was acknowledged that  i n determining the scope of the obligation of natural justice  the statutory framework is of crucial importance   I was referred by Mr Rhodes to the High Court decision of Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   where in the reasons for judgment of Kitto J at     his Honour considered whether the Taxation Board of Review was      legally bound to conform to the principles of natural justice in dealing with a reference in a case under s     Kitto J made the prefatory observations that  a  legal obligation so to act arises in respect of many statutory powers     there being      no words which are of universal application to every kind of inquiry and every kind of tribunal     but  w hat the law requires in the discharge of a quasi judicial function is judicial fairness    which is      not a label for any fixed body of rules     and  w hat is fair in a given situation depends upon the circumstances    The statutory context of the then Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act      Cth  which was of course in focus in Mobil Oil   is significantly removed from that of the Management Act  Mr Rhodes sought support additionally for the operation in principle of the rules as to natural justice from the dictum of Brennan J in National Companies and Securities Commission v News Corporation Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   where his Honour observed as follows      the limits of a statutory function are ascertained the interests which are apt to be affected by the performance of the function can be identified  Then it is possible for a court to say in the absence of express statutory provision what has to be done to be fair to those whose interests are apt to be affected by the performance of the function  The terms of the statute which creates the function  the nature of the function and the administrative framework in which the statute requires the function to be performed are material factors in determining what must be done to satisfy the requirements of natural justice         Those considerations render formidable the task of establishing the operation of the rules of natural justice in the present statutory context where the basis for prospective qualification would be the same for all applicants  that being the holding of an existing shark permit conditional of course upon payment of the permit fee or

DISTRICT REGISTRY TAD   OF     ON APPEAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL CONSTITUTED BY ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR DAVIS   BETWEEN  DAVID JOHN RHODES   Applicant AND  AUSTRALIAN FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY   Respondent   JUDGE  CONTI J DATE OF ORDER    SEPTEMBER   WHERE MADE  SYDNEY   THE COURT ORDERS THAT    The application for review by way of appeal from the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal made on   July   be dismissed  This further issue was raised by Mr Rhodes by way of challenge to the exercise by AFMA of its power of cancellation of Mr Rhodes  fishing permit for reasons of so called  non payment of fees or levies  it was acknowledged that  i n determining the scope of the obligation of natural justice  the statutory framework is of crucial importance   I was referred by Mr Rhodes to the High Court decision of Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation   HCA         CLR   where in the reasons for judgment of Kitto J at     his Honour considered whether the Taxation Board of Review was      legally bound to conform to the principles of natural justice in dealing with a reference in a case under s     Kitto J made the prefatory observations that  a  legal obligation so to act arises in respect of many statutory powers     there being      no words which are of universal application to every kind of inquiry and every kind of tribunal     but  w hat the law requires in the discharge of a quasi judicial function is judicial fairness    which is      not a label for any fixed body of rules     and  w hat is fair in a given situation depends upon the circumstances    The statutory context of the then Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act      Cth  which was of course in focus in Mobil Oil   is significantly removed from that of the Management Act  Mr Rhodes sought support additionally for the operation in principle of the rules as to natural justice from the dictum of Brennan J in National Companies and Securities Commission v News Corporation Ltd   HCA         CLR   at   where his Honour observed as follows      the limits of a statutory function are ascertained the interests which are apt to be affected by the performance of the function can be identified  Then it is possible for a court to say in the absence of express statutory provision what has to be done to be fair to those whose interests are apt to be affected by the performance of the function  The terms of the statute which creates the function  the nature of the function and the administrative framework in which the statute requires the function to be performed are material factors in determining what must be done to satisfy the requirements of natural justice         Those considerations render formidable the task of establishing the operation of the rules of natural justice in the present statutory context where the basis for prospective qualification would be the same for all applicants  that being the

  ON APPEAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS TRIBUNAL CONSTITUTED BY ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR DAVIS   BETWEEN  DAVID JOHN RHODES   Applicant AND  AUSTRALIAN FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY   Respondent   JUDGE  CONTI J DATE OF ORDER    SEPTEMBER   WHERE MADE  SYDNEY   THE COURT ORDERS THAT    The application for review by way of appeal from the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal made on   July   be dismissed  It was next contended by Mr Rhodes that  a n important factor relevant to the scope of natural justice is the consequence of the decision   In Gribbles Pathology  Vic  Pty Ltd v Cassidy   FCA         FCR   at   Weinberg J enunciated the following principle      is well established that the seriousness of a decision for an affected individual is one of the main considerations determining the application of procedural fairness  Generally speaking  the requirements of procedural fairness will be heightened in proportion to the gravity of the consequences involved      It was said in that context that if AFMA was right to refuse Mr Rhodes a new permit on  no new permits  or  cost recovery  grounds  the consequence of cancellation of his permit would be his effective expulsion from the fishery  that being described as  a very serious consequence to Mr Rhodes   Apart from the particular elements of the statutory scheme here relevantly required to be adjectivally observed  there was here involved an absence of response on his part over an extended period of time involving what the Tribunal characterised in terms of inevitable consequences  obvious to him    The reality of Mr Rhodes  circumstances of default was such as to render attenuated his invocation of the scope of natural justice inherent in the submission  A further matter submitted by Mr Rhodes not to have been considered by the AAT  but nevertheless said to have been relevant to the circumstances in which he found himself to be placed  was that his long involvement in the industry  and the potential effects on him of any decision to cancel the permit  gave rise inherently to a legitimate expectation of procedural fairness  The submission begged the question at least as to what was inherently unfair procedurally in the nature and extent of the steps taken and processes implemented by AFMA which merely conformed to the steps and processes required to be put in train in relation to any industry participant who was placed in the same vulnerable position as Mr Rhodes  A yet further factor said here to have prevailed in Mr Rhodes  favour against any cancellation of his permit was a lack of urgency in relation to the making by AFMA of its cancellation decision  It was submitted by Mr Rhodes that there was no good reason for AFMA to have made that decision in relation to the cancellation of the permit within a matter of  weeks after the suspension   It was further submitted that the Management Act expressly contemplated the indefinite suspension of a permit  and there was no requirement even to consider cancellation after a suspension  However it was plainly within AFMA s prerogative to determine whether it should exercise juridical powers and remedies which had crystallised in operation to the extent that it deceased to be appropriate in the contextual circumstances  Mr Rhodes next submitted that he had been already prohibited from fishing prior to the cancellation of his permit  yet interest on the unpaid levies would continue to accrue at a penal rate  No benefit to AFMA was therefore obtainable from cancellation of the permit  other than AFMA s view that it could thereupon terminate the need for so called  internal reconsideration  and that such motivation on AFMA s part would have been improper in any event  It was further submitted that this would have a  very adverse effect  on Mr Rhodes  It was not however a condition to AFMA s lawful exercise of regulatory authority to endeavour to divine the particular implications of a permit cancellation personal or peculiar to a defaulting permit holder  so long as the requirements of the stipulated procedure were observed  In that regard the AAT found it sufficient in any event that AFMA had made attempts to communicate with Mr Rhodes prior to the cancellation  such attempts consisting of AFMA s letters of   May   and   May   calling a telephone number listed on AFMA records  and requesting on   June   that the local police get in touch with Mr Rhodes  Mr Rhodes submitted in any event that since the AAT did not find that he received any of that AFMA correspondence or had any actual notice of AFMA s intention to cancel the subject permit  and further that the AAT expressly refused to make any finding that Mr Rhodes had deliberately avoided potential creditors  or had received what was described as  financial correspondence  those factors should have rendered inapplicable any issue otherwise arising as to Mr Rhodes  absence of response to AFMA s communications related to Mr Rhodes  default  Instead it was contended by Mr Rhodes that the AAT took the view that his ignorance of AFMA s intention to cancel his permit was unreasonable  To the extent that that contention did have juridical significance  which I am unable to accept in any event  it is not possible to divine any basis for the extremity of the course which AFMA should have supposedly pursued in an endeavour to communicate relevantly with Mr Rhodes  and to do so prior to exercising its legal rights and remedies
