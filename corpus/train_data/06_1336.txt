Upton v Tasmanian Perpetual Trustees Pty Ltd   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toCroker v Deputy Registrar of the High Court of Australia   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The Court s power to order security for costs is found in s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth   As Hely J said in Croker v Deputy Registrar of the High Court of Australia   FCA   at            It is clear from s   of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth    and from Order   Rule   of the Federal Court Rules   that a single judge of the Court has power to order the provision of security for the costs of an appeal  even though the appeal itself is to be heard before a Full Court  followedFletcher and Others v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR   My only concern about the grant of an order for security for costs is that it may shut out an impecunious litigant from advancing a case  see Fletcher and Others v Commissioner of Taxation     FCR     Fletcher    Although it must be borne in mind that on appeal that issue may be less significant given that the appellant has already had the benefit of a judgment of a court  see Fletcher at     Mr Upton has not asserted that he is impecunious  but only that he is unable to provide security for     or any like sum   In any event  my view that his appeal does not have a good chance of success outweighs the consideration that an order for security for costs may stifle the appeal   I consider it is appropriate to order Mr Upton to provide security for Tasmanian Perpetual Trustees  costs of the appeal given the poor prospect of the appeal being successful referred toSun World International Inc v Registrar  Plant Breeder s Rights  unreported  Marshall J    December   Delay in applying for an order for security for costs can be a factor against the making of an order  see  for example  Sun World International Inc v Registrar  Plant Breeder s Rights  unreported  Marshall J    December    However  in the current matter  Tasmanian Perpetual Trustees applied to the Court promptly for security for costs  some three and a half weeks after the filing of the notice of appeal and before any further step had been taken in the proceeding or further costs incurred  This aspect of Mr Upton s resistance to an order for security for costs is unfounded   A factor weighing against the making of an order for security for costs is that such an order would stifle the litigation  An allied factor is the circumstance that the impecuniosity of the person from whom security is sought has been caused by the conduct of the person seeking such security  Mr Upton relied on those factors in resisting an order for security for costs   An order for security for costs in the sum of     would stifle the litigation as Mr Upton is unable to satisfy an award in that amount or any  like amount   That is a factor to be weighed in his favour in considering the application appliedTruth About Motorways Pty Limited v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Limited   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  The discretion to award security for costs is wide but must be exercised judicially  see Truth About Motorways Pty Limited v Macquarie Infrastructure Investment Management Limited   FCA   at      Mr Upton contended that security for costs should not be ordered in his appeal because          he is unable to provide security for     or any like sum because of the conduct of Tasmanian Perpetual Trustees    an order for security for costs and staying the appeal would stifle his appeal and lead to a sequestration order being made against him and to his other creditors being disadvantaged  and    Tasmanian Perpetual Trustees did not request him to provide security for costs before applying to the Court  Further  Tasmanian Perpetual Trustees did not apply to the Court for more than   days after the appeal was filed and applied prior to a notice of appearance in the appeal being filed   Mr Upton also took issue with the estimate of Tasmanian Perpetual Trustees that the appeal would consume three days  hearing time referred toUpton v Tasmanian Perpetual Trustees Pty Ltd   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html
