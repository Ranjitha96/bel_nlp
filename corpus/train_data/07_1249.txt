Black v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship   FCA     August  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlreferred toHowells v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The Minister is not bound to proceed by reference to the direction under s   of the Act  namely  Direction No   Howells v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs   FCAFC         FCR   at       However  he may choose to do so  In this case  he said that he would proceed in accordance with the Direction   The applicant submits that the third primary consideration referred to in Direction No   namely  the best interests of the child  is only relevant if there is a child  He points to paragraph    c  set out in   above and he also points to the following paragraph in Direction No           This consideration only applies if the child is or would be less than   years of age at the time when the decision is intended to come into effect  The best interests of any children aged   years or more is not a primary consideration but may be considered with other considerations under paragraph       It should be noted that Direction No   makes it clear that although generally speaking it is in the child s best interests to remain with his or her parent  there may be circumstances in which the best interests are served by separation from the non citizen referred toMinister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  It was accepted by the applicant that Direction No   is  not so broadly stated as to cover all considerations properly brought to bear on the exercise of the discretion   I think that approach is correct  In other words  where the decision under s   is made by the Minister  as opposed to his delegate  jurisdictional error is not established simply by showing a misconstruction of Direction No   it must be shown that the Minister acted outside the terms of the statutory power  Section   does not state the matters the Minister must or may take into account in exercising the discretion  In exercising an apparently unconfined discretion the determination of the limits of the statutory power is made having regard to the subject matter  scope and purpose of the power and the Act in which it appears  In Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd   HCA         CLR   Mason J said at      In the context of judicial review on the ground of taking into account irrelevant considerations  this Court has held that  where a statute confers a discretion which in its terms is unconfined  the factors that may be taken into account in the exercise of the discretion are similarly unconfined  except in so far as there may be found in the subject matter  scope and purpose of the statute some implied limitation on the factors to which the decision maker may legitimately have regard  see Reg v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal  Ex parte  HD Pty Ltd   adopting the earlier formulations of Dixon J in Swan Hill Corporation v Bradbury   and Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission  NSW  v Browning   By analogy  where the ground of review is that a relevant consideration has not been taken into account and the discretion is unconfined by the terms of the statute  the court will not find that the decision maker is bound to take a particular matter into account unless an implication that he is bound to do so is to be found in the subject matter  scope and purpose of the Act    Footnotes omitted   As I understood it  the applicant also conceded that if all the Minister did was to take into account as a matter in favour of cancelling the applicant s visa the fact that the applicant had no children then although the Minister had misconstrued Direction No   that would not constitute a jurisdictional error  I think that concession was correctly made because there is nothing in the nature and purpose of the statutory provisions to indicate that the fact that the applicant had no children is a matter the Minister was prohibited from taking into account   The applicant submits that the Minister in fact made a more serious error than simply taking into account that the applicant had no children and that the error he made was a jurisdictional error  I do not find it easy to articulate the more serious error identified by the applicant but  as I understand it  it was that the Minister had found that the best interests of the children favoured cancellation of the visa when in fact that there were no children  I reject that submission  A fair reading of the Minister s reasons is that he found that the fact that the applicant had no children was a matter in favour of cancelling his visa  That was a misconstruction of Direction No   but not a jurisdictional error referred toMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Gray     FCR   The next question is whether the error of the Minister being a misconstruction of Direction No   amounts to jurisdictional error  The applicant referred to the following observations of French and Drummond JJ in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Gray     FCR   at      If a decision maker  not bound to apply policy  purports to apply it as a proper basis for disposing of the case in hand but misconstrues or misunderstands it so that what is applied is not the policy but something else  then there may be reviewable error  In a limiting case a policy may be so broadly stated as to cover all considerations properly brought to bear on the exercise of the discretion  In such a case misconstruction of the policy may reduce to misconstruction of the statute or misunderstanding of its purpose  referred toMinister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  In the same way as the reasons of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Refugee Review Tribunal are not to be approached  minutely and finely with an eye keenly attuned to the perception of error  neither are the reasons of the Minister  Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang   HCA         CLR   at     per Brennan CJ  Toohey  McHugh and Gummow JJ   Even adopting that approach  I am of the opinion that the Minister misconstrued Direction No    The Minister referred to  the information relevant to this consideration  and the only information to which that could have referred is the statement that the applicant has no children  That is the information the Minister said weighed in favour of cancelling the applicant s visa and to which he said he gave  as a consideration  considerable weight  In my opinion  that is a misconstruction of Direction No   because once the decision maker finds that a non citizen has no children  the matter or consideration became irrelevant  I do not think it is possible to construe the Minister s reasons as saying no more than that the matter of the best interests of the child was irrelevant and  as this was generally a matter in favour of not cancelling the visa  the other matters in favour of cancellation were not counter balanced by this consideration referred toMinister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  Re  Ex parte Lam   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The rules of procedural fairness apply to the exercise of the power in s   of the Act  Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs  Ex parte Lam   HCA         CLR     Lam     The applicant submits that the matter the Minister took into account the fact that the applicant did not have children was a matter in favour of cancelling his visa stood outside the terms of Direction No    The applicant submits that he was not given the opportunity to comment upon whether that was a matter the Minister should take into account  The applicant submits that there had been a breach of the rules of procedural fairness and he put two alternative submissions   First  he submits that he was led to believe that the Minister would make his decision by reference to the matters in Direction No   and only by reference to those matters  That submission requires an examination of the two letters sent to the applicant inviting him to make submissions in support of his contention that his visa should not be cancelled  In the letter from the Department dated   August   the following passage appears      Should your visa be cancelled      If the Minister or a delegate makes a determination that he or she reasonably suspects that you do not pass the character test  and you fail to satisfy him or her that you do pass the character test  the Minister or the delegate will then consider whether your visa should be cancelled     Considerations to be taken into account if decision is made by a delegate     In considering whether to exercise the power under s   to cancel your visa  a delegate will be required to follow directions given by the Minister under s   of the Migration Act   Those directions are contained in Direction No    Direction under Section   Visa Refusal and Cancellation under Section   Migration Act         I have attached a copy of Direction No   for your information     Considerations to be taken into account if decision is made by the Minister     If the decision in relation to cancellation of your visa is made by the Minister  although she may decide to have regard to the matters discussed in Minister s Direction No   she is not required to give consideration to those matters     Your opportunity to comment     Before the Minister or delegate considers whether to cancel your visa under s     you are provided with an opportunity to comment  You may provide information and comments in relation to        whether you fail the character test  and    whether your visa should be cancelled        In making a decision whether to cancel your visa under s     the Minister or delegate will take the following information into account already available to the Department        Offender History Report  Attachment A      Certificate of Record for the sentence of    Attachment B      Judge s sentencing remarks of    Attachment C      Report by Community Corrections Officer dated    Attachment D        The Department has also obtained reports from the Parole Board of SA  These reports have been classified as  non disclosable information  pursuant to Section   of the Act and can not  sic  be released to you  however you are invited to comment     If there is any additional information that you wish the Minister or delegate to consider  you must give that information to the Department  If you do not provide any further information the Minister or a delegate may rely upon the information set out above to determine that your visa are  sic  are liable to cancellation under s   of the Migration Act      In preparing your comments  please read fully and carefully the contents of the Minister s Direction  You should address each and every topic that you feel applies to you or is relevant to your circumstances  You may also provide any further information  apart from those considerations found in the Minister s Direction  that you feel the Minister or delegate ought to be aware of and take into account   In my opinion  there are two answers to that submission  First  I am not satisfied that it can be inferred that the correspondence from the Department would have led to the belief  based on reasonable grounds  that the topic of children and the best interests of children would only be dealt with in the manner contemplated by Direction No   and not otherwise  In this case it is a matter of looking at what may be reasonably inferred from the letters sent by the Department and other circumstances  It was not contended that the applicant s actual belief is relevant  in any event there was no evidence of his belief  It seems to me that the significance to the decision of having a family including children in Australia or not having a family for a person facing the cancellation of their visa would be obvious  Furthermore  I note that although it appears under the heading of  Other considerations  in Direction No   the Direction identifies  family composition of the non citizen s family  both in Australia and overseas  as a relevant consideration  cl    d   Secondly  I do not think it can be said that any practical injustice has been shown  Lam at     per Gleeson CJ  at       per McHugh and Gummow JJ  I realise that the Court must be careful not to engage in a determination of the merits of a decision under the guise of considering an argument as to futility  However  in this case I do not think there was any practical injustice to the applicant  In practical terms he was afforded a full opportunity to be heard on the matters ultimately taken into account by the Minister   In my opinion  the application must be dismissed  I will hear the parties on costs   I certify that the preceding thirty seven   numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for
