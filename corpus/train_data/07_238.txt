SZIWW v Minister for Immigration   Citizenship   FCA     February  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlquotedcitedMinister of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SZFDE   FCAFC  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  There are a number of authorities which have dealt with the question of whether a finding of procedural fairness  or failure to afford procedural fairness  is open in circumstances where there is no demonstrated engagement by the Tribunal in conduct relevant to that question  The Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia has considered this matter recently in Minister of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SZFDE   FCAFC    That was a case in which a Lebanese family had the misfortune to be introduced  by a relative of the family  to a man who was thought to be a solicitor with a great deal of experience in migration matters  The family engaged him to represent them in their application for review by the Tribunal  However  unknown to the family  the particular agent had been struck off as a solicitor in December   and deregistered as a migration agent in March    The family paid the agent a considerable sum of money  namely    and accordingly  was influenced by quite calculated fraud  The family had been dissuaded from appearing at a hearing before the Tribunal by the fraud of the agent   His Honour  Allsop J  at paragraph   of the reasons  reviews the principles governing the circumstances in which procedural fairness might be found to have failed by reason of the intervention of a third party  At paragraph   his Honour said this     Whilst the consequences of fraud practised upon the decision making process of an administrative tribunal might  in some cases  lead to the conclusion that a decision had been made without authority or exhibiting jurisdictional error  that conclusion will generally be reached by reference to notions of procedural fairness  Whilst the taxonomy or categorisation of legal principle should not impede its recognition or operation  some characterisation is called for here by the terms of s  B    I pause to add that in this particular case  s  B was not part of the legislative scheme but nevertheless  the statement of principle in relation to the circumstances in which procedural fairness might be found to have failed and thus jurisdictional error arises  remains persuasive  His Honour  continued at      It is difficult to see here how  absent regard to the rules of procedural fairness or  the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule  one can identify a principle of law that permits the conclusion that there has been jurisdictional error  There has been no fraud of the Tribunal  There has been no fraud of the executive department  There was an invitation to attend a hearing  That invitation was declined  That decision to decline the invitation was influenced by the dishonesty and fraudulent purpose of the agent of the applicants  I do not see the basis for a conclusion that there was any denial of procedural fairness  or that those circumstances denied the Tribunal the authority to decide the review given the terms of ss      A and  B   I do not think that it is an accurate conclusion to say that the legislative scheme was corrupted by fraud or that a hearing was denied by fraud    See also Minister of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v
