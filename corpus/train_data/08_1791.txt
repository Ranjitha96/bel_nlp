bill of lading was a document of title giving the right to call for delivery of the cargo at the port of destination   That decision of the Supreme People s Court is entitled to the greatest respect as both the decision of the highest court of a great maritime nation and because of its erudite reasoning  However  I am satisfied that the Supreme People s Court s decision is distinguishable from the present case  First  there is no suggestion  in this case  that the bills of lading here permit the carrier  Beluga  to deliver the cargo except on production of an original  Secondly  that judgment was given prior to the decision in The Raphaela S     AC    I do not think that the Supreme People s Court s decision was intended to have a wider operation than dealing with the status of a straight bill of lading  the proper law of which was that of the United States of America  However  if it did  I prefer to follow the reasoning in The Raphaela S     AC    And  in any event  the provisions of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act    Cth  are binding on me and provide that a straight bill is a sea carriage document for the purposes of the amended Hague Rules   Here  the commercial possibility has not been excluded that an original bill of lading has gone  or may get  into the hands of a third party who is not before the Court  In that situation  I am of opinion that the Sheriff should not be put at risk  nor should the Court itself be put at risk  of committing a conversion of the goods by agreeing to vary orders made on the appropriate and conventional basis that original bills of lading be produced for the discharge of cargo from the Sheriff s custody   I suggested to the parties that one possible solution worthy of their consideration may be that the Court could order redelivery of the cargo to the person from whom it came  namely the master of the MV Beluga Fantastic   by his agents  and that thereafter the master could take such commercial risks  if at all  as he saw fit in causing the cargo to be delivered under whatever commercial arrangements the parties wished to make  However  that suggestion was not taken up by the parties citedNeilson v Overseas Projects Corp   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  I am of opinion that the same result must follow here  There is no evidence of the provisions on the reverse of the bills of lading for the cargo held by the sheriff  There is also no evidence that India is a party to the Hague Rules or other international conventions referred to in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act    Cth    India appears to have enacted similar provisions to the Hague Rules in The Indian Carriage of Goods by Sea Act    India  and to have included in the Schedule to that Act Rules Relating to Bills of Lading containing a similar definition of a contract of carriage in Art I b  of the Hague Visby Rules   For present purposes I assume that Indian law is the same as Australian law in accordance with the presumption that foreign law is the same as that of the law of the forum   lex fori   Neilson v Overseas Projects Corporation of Victoria Ltd   HCA         CLR   at     per McHugh

in Schedule  A of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act   apply by force of Arts   and   to this cargo unless the original Hague Rules   referred to in the Act as the  Brussels Convention    the Hague Visby Rules  the SDR protocol or the Hamburg Rules apply by agreement or law  There is no evidence of any provision that ousts the application of the amended Hague Rules   On the material before me  the bills of lading here are documents within the meaning of a  sea carriage document  in the amended Hague Rules  That definition includes both  a bill of lading that  by law  is not negotiable   Art
