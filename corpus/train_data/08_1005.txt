E    J  Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan Pty Limited  No     FCA     June  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedE   J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  html  In this matter reasons for decision were published on   June     E   J Gallo Winery v Lion Nathan   FCA   and the matter was stood over to this morning for the purpose of making final orders disposing of the proceeding   There is agreement as to the form of the orders to be made with one exception  That exception is whether an order for the removal of the Gallo Winery trademark should be made as from today s date  and that order stayed for   days  or whether the order for removal should take effect retrospectively as from   May    That date was the conclusion of the three year non use period  The stay was properly not opposed presumably upon the basis of preserving the rights of Gallo Winery should it wish to appeal   The discretionary power to order removal of a mark is that conferred by s   of the Trade Marks Act    Cth   No Australian decision has apparently addressed the question now posed by the competing submissions of Lion Nathan and Gallo Winery    It is considered that that discretionary power can only be exercised as from the date upon which a court makes an order for the removal of a mark from the Register and does not confer a power to order removal from a date prior to judgment  Rejected is the submission advanced on behalf of Lion Nathan that an order for the removal of a trademark for non use should normally be an order that it be removed as from the conclusion of the non use period otherwise than   in exceptional circumstances    No reason was advanced as to why such a qualification should be read into the discretion otherwise conferred by s     Section   is silent as to the date from which an order may be made  the sub section simply provides that   the court may order the Registrar to remove the trade mark from the Register     The conclusion that s   should not be construed as permitting  in effect  a retrospective removal of a trade mark is primarily based upon two considerations   Second  there is an absence of any indication in the terms of s   that the power may be exercised in the manner contended for by Lion Nathan  By way of contrast stand other provisions of the   Act  Where the legislature has intended that action may be taken with effect from a particular date  it has expressly so provided  Reference may thus be made  by way of example  to s   which provides as follows  Renewal within   months after registration expires If  within   months after the registration of a trade mark has expired  a person asks the Registrar  in accordance with subsection   to renew the registration of the trade mark  the Registrar must renew the registration of the trade mark for   years from the day on which the registration expired   Reference may also be made to s   which provides as follows  Trade mark restored to Register if notice of opposition filed within extended time If   a  the Registrar has removed a trade mark from the Register under subsection   because no notice of opposition was filed within the period provided under the regulations  and  b  the Registrar subsequently extends the period within which the notice may be filed  and  c  a notice of opposition is filed within the extended period  the Registrar must restore the trade mark to the Register  Also  the trade mark is taken not to have been removed from the Register   Neither of those provisions relate to the making of orders by this Court  But they do provide some support for the conclusion reached   Although no Australian decision has been cited to support the contention of Gallo Winery   reliance is placed upon Second Sight v Novell UK   RPC    There in issue was s   of the Trade Marks Act    UK  which provided as follows  Any person aggrieved     by any entry made in the register without sufficient cause or by any entry wrongly remaining on the register     may apply in the prescribed manner to the Court     or to the Registrar  and the tribunal may make such order for     expunging or varying the entry as the tribunal may think fit   Of that provision  Lightman J observed at     The issue is  by common consent  one of statutory construction of sections   and   in the context of the Trade Marks Act   as a whole  Specific provision is made in the Trade Marks Act   where an event or decision is to have retrospective effect  see  e g  section    Likewise specific provision is made in the Trade Marks Act    see e g  section    I can find neither in the language used nor in principle any grounds upon which it can sensibly be held that such a determination under an application under section   or section   can have any retrospective effect       This decision also provides some support for the conclusion reached  Lion Nathan did not point to any Australian decision in which an order of the kind that it now seeks has previously been made  even if the question of statutory construction now in issue was not debated    If this construction of s   be wrong  and should it be concluded that that sub section confers a discretion unconfined as to the time from which a mark may be ordered to be removed from the Register  it is considered in the circumstances of the present case that  as a matter of discretion  any order should operate only as from today s date  The hearing of the proceeding was expedited and there has been no delay that can be attributed to Gallo Winery perhaps indicating that it has had the benefit of registration for an inappropriate period of time   Before leaving the matter and before making final orders  it should be noted that in the reasons for decision as published on   June   the question as formulated in paragraph  iv  expressed the question as being whether the Radler beers of Lion Nathan were goods of the same description as the  BAREFOOT wine   of Gallo Winery   Although that is the manner in which the question was there expressed  it is not the question which was resolved at paragraphs     inclusive of those reasons  The question  as answered  is understood to be the question as properly framed  namely whether the Radler beers of Lion Nathan were goods of the same description as   wine     For these reasons  the proposed Order   will not have added to it the words urged by Lion Nathan   namely   with effect as from   May       The orders of the Court are       The Amended Application be dismissed      The Applicant to pay the Respondent s costs of the Amended Application       The Registrar of Trade Marks remove the Australian Trade Mark No   from the Register of Trade Marks      The operation of Order   be stayed for   a    days from the date hereof  or   b  in the event that the Applicant Cross Respondent within that time files a Notice of Appeal   until determination of the appeal  on the Applicant Cross Respondent s undertaking to pursue any such appeal with all due expedition      The Cross Respondent pay the Cross Claimant s costs of the Cross Claim    I certify that the preceding
