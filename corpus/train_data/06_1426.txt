Han v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs   FCA     October  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedCilli v Abbott     FLR   As a general rule  costs of an application follow the event  A key reason for this is because  as pointed out by the Full Court in Cilli v Abbott     FLR   at    the object of costs is not to penalise  it is to indemnify the successful party in relation to expense to which he has been put by reason of legal proceedings   This principle was adopted in Latoudis v Casey   HCA         CLR   per Mason CJ at   Toohey J at   and McHugh J at   in the context of both civil and criminal proceedings approvedGauci v Kennedy   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In my view  a decision of a Federal Magistrate dismissing an application pursuant to r     Federal Magistrates Court Rules   is an interlocutory decision  requiring leave of the Federal Court to appeal  Rana v University of South Australia   FCA     Gauci v Kennedy   FCA    No leave to appeal has been sought  However this point in my view is moot because  as I indicated earlier in this judgment  both parties were of the view that the appeal be dismissed  The real issue before me is in relation to costs citedHan v Minister for Immigration  No     FMCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FMCA  html  Subsequently  on   June   the appellant filed an application seeking an order that the orders of Jarrett FM be set aside  On   August   Jarrett FM made orders setting aside his orders of   February   that the applicant pay the respondent s costs of and incidental to its application filed   June   and that the Migration Review Tribunal be joined as a second respondent to those proceedings  His Honour also made directions including that the appellant s further application be listed for hearing on   October     Han v Minister for Immigration  No     FMCA     I understand that the further application was heard by Jarrett FM on   October   and his Honour has reserved judgment   As a result of this sequence of events  it follows that there is no reason for the appellant to maintain its appeal from the judgment of Jarrett FM of   February    Indeed  the appellant before me this morning submitted draft orders including that the appeal be dismissed   The issue upon which the parties do not agree however is the issue of costs in this appeal   In summary  the appellant has sought orders that     The appeal be dismissed      Costs of and incidental to the appeal follow the decision of Jarrett FM currently reserved  Federal Magistrates Court proceedings File No BRG  with the result that if the appellant is successful before Jarrett FM  the respondent should pay the costs of the appeal  and vice versa if the respondents are successful before Jarrett FM citedLatoudis v Casey   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  As a general rule  costs of an application follow the event  A key reason for

been set aside  the appeal should be dismissed and the appellant ordered to pay the respondent s costs of and incidental to the appeal     The appropriate way to proceed in relation to decisions in the Federal Magistrates Court under r     is to make an application to set aside the decision under r      The appellant eventually did this and was successful in having the decision set aside  This approach has been endorsed in a number of cases including MZWXC v MIMIA   FCA   and MLGXAL v MIMIA   FCA        The appeal in this matter was always misconceived as to the proper course to proceed  and incompetent as no application for leave to appeal was filed     The decision of Jarrett FM on the substantive hearing has no relevance to this appeal  Further  Ms Wheatley for the respondent submitted in Court this morning that costs in this appeal bear no relevance to the new matter before Jarrett FM   It is strongly argued by the respondent  on the basis of such authorities as MZWXC and MLGXAL that the appropriate course for the appellant to have adopted in the first place would have been to apply to have the decision of Jarrett FM set aside  I note from the notice of appeal that the appellant was unrepresented  or at least appeared unrepresented  at the time of filing  and he may not have understood that an application to set aside the judgment of   February   was the proper course in the circumstances  Irrespective of this  the respondent has been put to expense by legal proceedings in the form of this appeal  and this appeal has now been rendered nugatory by the appellant successfully applying to have the original judgment set aside and a fresh application determined by the Federal Magistrates Court   Before me this morning Mr Boccabella pressed that the appellant s case has merit  and that this should influence my approach to making a costs order in this matter  Counsel distinguished MZWXC and MLGXAL on this basis namely that the applications in those cases appeared to lack merit  In my view it is unnecessary to examine this issue in detail  other than to observe that it is clear that there is sufficient merit in the appellant s case to justify orders setting aside the decision of Jarrett FM of   February   but that the merits of the appellant s application before Jarrett FM will be considered by Jarrett FM in his judgment in due course  All parties agree that this appeal should be dismissed because it has been overtaken by events at the appellant s instigation  The merits of the substantive case now before Jarrett FM are of little relevance in the context before me citedMZWXC v MIMIA   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In summary  the respondent has submitted    Where an appeal arises from a
