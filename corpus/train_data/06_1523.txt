http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCAFC  html  The need for precision in the statement of the questions of law in a notice of appeal under s   of the AAT Act is explained by Branson J in Australian

erred in failing to apply one or more elements which it was required to apply in factor  b   That is not a question of law within the meaning of the authorities on an appeal under s   of the AAT Act  The Commission argued that because the Tribunal did not make a finding about the last clause of factor  b  the way in which the question of law was framed complied with s    In my opinion it does not  Before one reaches that step  one would need to know what  properly construed  factor  b  involved and a subsequent question of law would be whether it was properly applied to the facts as found by

during that period  In other words     the relevant words in effect refer to a compulsion to drink  not merely to the fact of drinking   The Commission argued that construction placed on factor  b  by the Tribunal in Re Schubinski and Repatriation Commission   AATA   at   was correct  It argued that  in effect  the last clause of factor  b  involves there being no choice for the applicant but to consume an average of not less than   grams per week of alcohol  What was meant by  no choice  was left unexplained   I am of opinion that factor  b  should not be construed in this way  The Repatriation Medical Authority had power to determine factor  b  pursuant to s  B  of the Act where it was of the view that on sound medical scientific evidence available it was more probable than not that a particular kind of injury  disease or death can be related to eligible war service rendered by veterans  The authority was then obliged to determine a statement of principles in respect of that kind of injury  disease or death  It had to set out the factors that must exist and which of those factors must be related to service rendered by a person before it could be said that  on the balance of probabilities  an injury  disease or death of that kind is connected with the circumstances of that service  Thus  there already had to be in existence sound medical scientific evidence  as defined in s  AB  of the Act  that it was more probable than not that consuming an average of at least   grams per week of alcohol for a continuous period of at least six months immediately before the clinical onset of hypertension which can be related to the eligible war service rendered by a veteran   The medical condition of hypertension is defined by factor  b  and involves permanently elevated or  high  blood pressure  Factor  b  requires the existence of the consumption of a minimum average amount of alcohol for not less than the six month period immediately before the clinical onset of the disease  Next   b  qualifies the foregoing requirements by adding a further one using the present tense  which cannot be decreased  in respect of past acts  The objective facts of a person s consumption of alcohol over a period of past history are identified as factors to be established by the first clause in factor  b   The other factors set out in factor   of the statement of principles all appear to identify factual events  e g  suffering from chronic renal failure at the time of the clinical onset of hypertension  factor  e  being obese at the time of the clinical onset of hypertension  factor  a  or suffering from sleep apnoea at the time of the clinical onset of hypertension  factor  a    Here  the purpose of a statement of principles  and in particular the obligation of the authority to set out  the factors that must exist   s  B c  show that the construction put forward by the Commission is of such an indefinite character that it would not fulfil the requirements of the statute  The authority eschewed the identification of a particular medical condition or other precise state of facts in using the expression  which cannot be decreased  in factor  b   That removed any objective standard by reference to which an hypothesis could be understood if the last clause is to be read as relevant to the applicant  his or her conduct or state of mind  If a literal reading is appropriate it clearly requires that there be no logical possibility of decreasing alcohol consumption below   grams per week  Then no one could satisfy it  Nor is the standard suggested in Re Schubinski and Repatriation Commission   AATA   at   satisfactory  The Tribunal s view in that decision that the words referred to a  compulsion to drink  does not arise out of the natural and ordinary meaning of the concluding clause of factor  b   Moreover  what a  compulsion to drink  is has been left undefined  It seems to go beyond a recognised illness such as alcoholism  Rather  it connotes incurable alcoholism  If there were a possibility that the alcoholism could have been cured within the period of six months or could have been so affected that the consumption could have been reduced below the threshold in factor  b  then the claimant would fail  Moreover  even an incurable alcoholic can be kept in an institution in which that person is not allowed to drink  That is a logical possibility  Any person could be kept in such a condition and therefore every person must fail the test if it is to be construed in a literal way   I am of opinion that the proper construction of factor  b  recognises that the present tense is used in the verb  cannot  to emphasize to the decision maker that the consumption of an average of at least   grams per week of alcohol for the continuous period of at least six months immediately preceding the clinical onset of hypertension is not to be ignored under any circumstances  Thus  even where the medical evidence might demonstrate that the veteran consumed less than   grams per week of alcohol immediately before the clinical onset of the hypertension and that that consumption was  as matter of fact  clinically causative of the condition  the concluding clause excludes the exercise of that clinical conclusion from consideration by the decision maker   The way in which factor  b  is to be applied is provided in ss   and  B   First  in making a determination of the present kind  the decision maker is required to  decide the matter to its reasonable satisfaction   s    In applying that criterion  the decision maker is  by force of s  B  to be reasonably satisfied that a disease contracted by a person was war caused or defence caused only if the material before the decision maker raises a connection between the disease of a person and some particular service rendered by the person and there is in force a statement of principles determined under s  B  which upholds the contention that that disease of the person is  on the balance of probabilities  connected with that service consideredRepatriation Commission v Gosewinckel     ALD   In Repatriation Commission v Gosewinckel     ALD   at     Weinberg J pointed out in a case under s  A that where a statement of principles requires the presence of a number of distinct symptoms  unless each of those symptoms is present  the case will not fit within the requirements of legislation  However  the relevant operation of s  B and its interaction with s  B  is not distinguishable for present purposes  although the degree of satisfaction which the decision maker must have is  of course  distinct   cf  Roncevich v Repatriation Commission   HCA         CLR   at                 In Repatriation Commission v Gosewinckel     ALD   at       Weinberg J noted that the provisions in Pt XIA of the Act      were introduced in order to take the determination of  purely medical     issues  out of the hands of bodies such as the tribunal  Explanatory Memorandum to Veterans  Affairs     Budget Measures  Legislation Amendment Bill   at p    The construction posited by the Commission in this case of factor  b  does not raise a  purely medical issue   Factor  b  works as a  purely medical issue  if one reads it as setting out the objective fact that   or more grams of alcohol  and nothing less  on average per week are consumed for a continuous period for at least six months before the clinical onset of hypertension  That is an objective fact that can be ascertained  The concluding clause in the factor emphasizes that it will not be satisfied if less than   grams per week are used in the calculation  That construction makes sense of the provision where a Tribunal might be inclined to think that near enough to   grams per week as average amount over the continuous period was good enough citedRepatriation Commission v Hill     ALD   The task of the Tribunal  therefore  was to determine to its reasonable satisfaction that factor  b  was made out  The effect of s  B b  is that once the Tribunal is reasonably satisfied that factor  b  exists  it can uphold the contention that the disease is connected with the service  In Repatriation Commission v Hill     ALD   at     Black CJ  Drummond and Kenny JJ said that an hypothesis connecting a disease with war service will only be reasonable if the material that raises it includes all of the essential elements prescribed by the relevant statement of principles   Thus  in a case such as the present  the Commission argues that every element in factor  b  had to be found by the Commission separately  Here  s   requires the decision maker to decide the matter according to its reasonable satisfaction  In doing so  it is important to note that s   provides that no party  whether applicant or Commission  has an onus of proving any matter that is or might be relevant to the determination of a claim or application  The Tribunal not only found in terms that all of the conditions in factor  b  in Mr Cotton s case were met to its satisfaction  but it also said that Mr Cotton s conduct while in the RAAF was  the causal influence that led him to making a decision to start drinking  and indeed smoking  and to continue to do so  consideredRhymney Iron Company v Gelligaer District Council     KB   In its natural and ordinary meaning in factor  b  the word  cannot  means that it is not

v Gosewinckel     ALD   at     Weinberg J pointed out in a case under s  A that where a statement of principles requires the presence of a number of distinct symptoms  unless each of those symptoms is present  the case will not fit within the requirements of legislation  However  the relevant operation of s  B and its interaction with s  B  is not distinguishable for present purposes  although the degree of satisfaction which the decision maker must have is  of course  distinct   cf  Roncevich v Repatriation Commission   HCA         CLR   at                 I am of opinion that when the Tribunal referred to his drinking constituting a habit and being addictive it was referring to the submission made by counsel for Mr Cotton  at   AATA   at      That submission had relied on the decision of the Full Court in Repatriation Commission v Tuite     FCR   at      and see too Roncevich v Repatriation Commission   HCA         CLR   at           to suggest that his service was a cause in making alcohol part of the fabric of Mr Cotton s social life and that the setting in which he found himself helped to constitute his drinking into a habit  There was no requirement for Mr Cotton to cease drinking  While neither party has an onus  s   the Tribunal had to deal with the material before it with the assistance which the parties offered it in deciding the question  It had the benefit of and made careful factual findings about the evidence  When referring to Repatriation Commission v Tuite     FCR   the Tribunal quoted from what Davies J  at   and Burchett and Einfeld JJ had said  at   that the social pressures and incidences of camp life were plainly capable of having a causal influence upon a decision to take up smoking and upon its continuance   The Commission argued that I should make factual findings pursuant to s   of the AAT Act as to Mr Cotton s ability to decrease his alcohol consumption to less than an average of   grams per week  Having regard to the fact that the Tribunal made credibility based findings which depended upon its assessment of  among other things  Mr Cotton and its acceptance and rejection of parts of his evidence  it would not be appropriate for me to embark upon such an enquiry even were I minded to accept the Commission s construction of factor  b   see too Roncevich v Repatriation Commission   HCA         CLR   at         Next  the Commission initially sought an order that  were the Tribunal s decision to be set aside  the decision of the Veterans Review Board which the Tribunal reviewed  be restored  I indicated during the course of argument that the effect of setting aside the Tribunal s decision would be to leave as the then operative decision whatever was the last administrative act preceding the Tribunal s decision  The Commission withdrew the application for an order dealing with this matter consideredThe Newbattle     PD   In its natural and ordinary meaning in factor  b  the word  cannot  means that it is not
