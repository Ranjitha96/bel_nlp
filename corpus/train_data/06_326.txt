Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton   FCA     March  http www austlii edu au au cases cth FCA  htmlcitedAustralian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton   FCA  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  On   January   the application by APRA for interlocutory relief was heard inter partes by Gray J  Gray J made orders which  inter alia  restrained Siminton until the trial of the action or further order from receiving money from members of the public by way of deposit in the Terra Nova Cache or the Principality of Camside and from dealing with or disposing of certain assets and moneys  see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton   FCA     Siminton filed notices of motion seeking to discharge the orders made by Sundberg J  Gray J and myself  I adjourned the motions to a date to be fixed   By notices of motion and statements of charge filed on   December   and   January    the contempt motions  APRA applied for orders that the respondent be punished for contempt in respect of nine alleged breaches of the Sundberg J orders  Siminton applied to have the hearing of the contempt motions adjourned until after the hearing of the substantive proceeding against him or until after the conclusion of any criminal proceedings that might be commenced  I refused Siminton s application and proceeded with the hearing of the contempt motions   Siminton  through his counsel  pleaded not guilty to the contempt charges and put APRA to proof of the charges   It is not seriously in dispute  and I am satisfied that     a  a copy of the Sundberg J orders was personally served on Siminton on   December    b  the terms of the orders were clear and were capable of being complied with by Siminton   c  Siminton had knowledge of the terms of the orders   The main issue at the hearing in relation to the charges was whether APRA had established beyond reasonable doubt that Siminton engaged in deliberate conduct which was in breach of the Sundberg J orders  The other issue was whether the Sundberg J orders were made without jurisdiction resulting in them being a nullity and not capable of founding a basis for the contempt motions   In the statements of charge filed on   January   and   January    respectively   the first statement of charge  and  the second statement of charge  APRA alleged three kinds of breaches of the Sundberg J orders  First  breaches of Sundberg J s orders that Siminton be restrained  inter alia  from dealing with or disposing of moneys standing to his credit and or that of his nominee   the disposal allegations   Second  breaches of Sundberg J s orders that Siminton file certain documents and an affidavit with the Court  the failure to file allegations   Third  a breach of Sundberg J s order that a certain notice be placed on the websites of the Principality of Camside and the Terra Nova Cache  the website notice allegation   Each of the categories of charges and the charges themselves are dealt with below in chronological order   On   December   Sundberg J made the following order                Until further order  the Respondent  whether by himself  his servants or agents or otherwise  be restrained from                 b  dealing with  withdrawing or disposing of  or giving any instructions in relation to the disposition or transfer of  all or any part of the moneys standing to the credit of the Respondent and or his nominee in any account  whether held alone  jointly or in conjunction with any other person  including any accounts or property in the name of the Principality of Camside or the Terra Nova Cache  in any bank  building society or other financial institution and  without limiting the generality of the foregoing  the following account        Commonwealth Bank of Australia         Account Name  Principality of Camside     Account Number                 SAVE THAT nothing in this Order shall prevent the Respondent from       d  paying his ordinary and usual living expenses up to a maximum amount of   per week  to be drawn first from any cash or bank account held by the Respondent other than the Commonwealth Bank of Australia account       or    e  paying legal costs reasonably incurred in this proceeding     or from paying such further sums as may be agreed in writing by the Applicant or permitted by further order of the Court    Significant evidence in relation to the disposal allegations was set out in the affidavit of Paul Charles Monsted  Monsted  sworn   January    Monsted is the managing director of Technocash Pty Ltd  Technocash  which he described as being  an internet based service to facilitate money transfers both within Australian and internationally   In paras     of its written submissions  APRA set out the matters it says are established by the evidence in respect of charge     in the second statement of charge         On   December   the Respondent effected or gave instructions in relation to the transfer of     from the Terra Nova Cache account  held with Technocash  to the Agios account  also held with Technocash                 Technocash is an internet based service that facilitates money transfers within Australia and internationally                 At all relevant times the Respondent held the Terra Nova Cache account at Technocash  Account No                         The formal name of the Terra Nova Cache account  being Account No         is  Dr David Siminton   The trading name of that account up to and including   December   was  Terra Nova Cache                  The trading name of the Terra Nova Cache Account changed after   December    At the time of the transfer of   December   the trading name of the account was  Terra Nova Cache   This is evident from transaction details recorded in Annexure  PCM  to the Monsted affidavit                  PCM  is a true copy of a print out recording Transaction Details for the Agios account  The   th item in  PCM  records a deposit of     from the Terra Nova Cache account on   December   to the Agios account                 The corresponding debit entry to the Terra Nova Cache account is recorded in Annexure  PCM  to the Monsted affidavit  Item   records a debit of     on   December    The  Function  column records  Sent to BF  meaning that the funds were transferred to another Technocash BillFold account  The transfer was made from the Terra Nova Cache account to the Agios account                 The contact person for the Agios account is Hardy Erhardt  the Respondent s solicitor                 APRA submits that the transfer of     from the Terra Nova Cache account to the Agios account was deliberate  The person who made this internet transfer was required to verify his or her intentions by selecting appropriate responses from drop down menus after logging on  The Respondent is the only person authorised to use his Technocash Account  No other persons are listed                 Further  APRA submits that the Respondent  or a person acting on the Respondent s instructions  made the transfer  The Respondent s Technocash Account has two levels of security                    The first level of security involves the user providing an account number and password to log on to the account        The second level of security requires the user to enter a  spend  password  which protects transfers out of the account                 The conclusion that the Respondent deliberately effected  or gave instructions in relation to the transfer of     from the Terra Nova Cache account to the Agios account is the only rational inference to be drawn from the evidence outlined in paragraphs   and   above  and in paragraph   below  see para   of judgment   Any alternative hypothesis could not be regarded as reasonable in the absence of evidence to support that hypothesis when that evidence  if it exists as all  must be within the knowledge of the Respondent    footnotes omitted  Although counsel appearing for Siminton contended that the evidence did not establish deliberate breaches of the orders by Siminton as is alleged in the disposal allegations  he did not point to any specific deficiencies in APRA s evidence nor did he explain why the inferences that APRA was seeking to establish  to the effect that Siminton  whether by himself or others acting as his agent  disposed of or gave instructions to dispose of moneys in the accounts referred to in   of the Sundberg J orders  should not be drawn   I am satisfied that the evidence adduced by the applicant establishes each of the matters of fact relied upon by APRA  The evidence was not controverted and is strongly supported by the affidavit and documentary evidence   For the reasons set out in APRA s submissions  I am satisfied that APRA has proved beyond reasonable doubt that Siminton deliberately engaged in the conduct set out in charges     and     of the first statement of charge and charges             and     of the second statement of charge and that that conduct breached the Sundberg J orders in the manner alleged by APRA   On   December   Sundberg J made the following order         Subject to the right of the Respondent to object to producing any information or document on the ground that to do so may tend to incriminate him  the Respondent  on or before   December   make and swear  and file and serve  a full and sufficient affidavit setting out         a  The name and address of any bank  building society or other financial institution at which there is an account in the name  or under the control  of the Respondent  including  but not limited to  any accounts in the name of the Principality of Camside or the Terra Nova Cache  together with the number of such account and the balance therein at the date of service of notice of this order upon the Respondent     b  The amount of cash in the possession of or under the control of the Respondent at the date of service of notice of this order upon the Respondent  including any cash in the possession of or under the control of any person who lives at the same residential address as the Respondent     c  The name and address of any person or persons indebted to the Respondent at the date of service of notice of this Order upon the Respondent  and the amount of the debt or debts owed by such person or persons     d  Full details of all facts and matters within the knowledge or belief of the Respondent concerning the receipt of money by the Respondent  the Principality of Camside or the Terra Nova Cache  or the transfer of money by the Respondent to any other person  including in relation to each occasion on which money was received or transferred           i  the amount so received or transferred     ii  from whom the money was received or to whom the money was transferred     iii  the address and  contact  details of the person or entity from whom the money was received or to whom it was transferred     iv  when it was received or transferred     v  for what purposes it was received or transferred     vi  the terms upon which it was received or transferred     vii  the manner in which the said funds were dealt with  and    viii  the current location and amount of the said funds or any earnings thereof   In paras     of its written submissions  APRA set out the matters it says are established by the evidence in respect of charge     of the first statement of charge         The Respondent did not  on or before   December   make and swear and file and serve the affidavit the subject of paragraph   of the Order                 On   January   the Respondent swore an affidavit  claiming privilege against self incrimination in relation to the making and swearing of the affidavit the subject of paragraph                   Nevertheless  the Respondent breached paragraph   by failing to make and swear any affidavit on or before   December      footnotes omitted  Although Siminton filed no evidence  it was common ground that on a date after   December   he exercised his entitlement to object to complying with   of the Sundberg J orders on the ground of self incrimination   In my view  APRA has not established charge     beyond reasonable doubt  The requirement to file the affidavit was expressed to be subject to Siminton s right to object to filing the affidavit on the ground of self incrimination  There is some ambiguity in the order in relation to whether the obligation imposed by it is subject to the objection being made prior to   December   or whether the obligation itself is subject to the right to object  As I explained in AIG at   and   a person will not be committed for contempt where  on one construction of the order said to have been breached  there may not have been a breach  In the present case  two constructions of   of the Sundberg J orders are reasonably open and  because the breach only arises on one of those constructions  the contempt alleged cannot be established beyond reasonable doubt   On   December   Sundberg J made the following order         Subject to the right of the Respondent to object to producing any information or document on the ground that to do so may tend to incriminate him  on or before   December   the Respondent produce to the Victoria District Registrar of the Court the originals of all statements of account  deposit slips  transfer applications  or records or memoranda of any kind in his possession  custody or control that relate to deposits with  earnings from  including any profit share or interest  or the withdrawal of any funds that relate to the Principality of Camside or the Terra Nova Cache   In paras     of its written submissions  APRA set out the matters it says are established by the evidence in respect of charge     of the first statement of charge         The Respondent did not  on or before   December   produce to the Victoria District Registrar of the Court the documents the subject of paragraph   of the Order                 On   January   the Respondent swore an affidavit  claiming privilege against self incrimination in relation to the production of the documents                 Nevertheless  the Respondent breached paragraph   by failing to produce the documents on or before   December      footnotes omitted  For the reasons set out in   I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Siminton breached   of the Sundberg J orders by failing to produce documents to the Court as required by that order   On   December   Sundberg J made the following order         Within two days of this order being served upon him  the Respondent cause to be published on the first page that a user views when he or she access         a  any current  proposed or future internet site that uses the names  Principality of Camside   Terra Nova Cache  or any derivation thereof  and          a  any other internet site controlled by the Respondent          a notice in form set out in Schedule   hereto   In paras     of its written submissions  APRA set out the matters it says are established by the evidence in respect of charge     of the first statement of charge         The Respondent did not  within two days of   December    the day when the orders of Sundberg J were served on the Respondent  cause a notice to be placed on the internet site of  the Principality of Camside  the notice in the form set out in Schedule   to the Order  as required by paragraph                   On   January   the Respondent swore an affidavit in which he attested that the required notice  now appears on the website of the Principality of Camside  and that he had attempted to place a similar notice on  a website for the Terra Nova Cache   The Respondent does not testify as to the date when the required notice was inserted on the website of  the Principality of Camside                  Despite his belated claimed compliance with paragraph   the Respondent breached that order by failing  by   December   to cause the notice to be placed on the website of  the Principality of Camside  a breach that continued until at least   December      footnotes omitted  In an affidavit sworn on   December   a senior analyst at APRA  Matthew Paul Wyllie  stated that on   December   he logged on to the Principality of Camside website and that no notice in the form set out in Schedule   to the Sundberg J orders had been placed on that website  He exhibited to his affidavit a print out of a webpage headed  Welcome to HM Government of Camside  which had a button with the word  Enter  on it  The date on the bottom of the print out is   December    There is no notice of the requisite kind on that print out   Paragraph   of the Sundberg J orders required Siminton to  cause  a particular outcome  He failed to do so and there is no evidence that he was unable to  cause  that outcome  In the circumstances  I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Siminton breached   of the Sundberg J orders by failing to cause the requisite notice to be posted on the website of the Principality of Camside within two days of service of the Sundberg J orders  I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Siminton breached   by failing to cause the requisite notice to be posted on the website of the Terra Nova Cache within two days of service of the Sundberg J orders   The other basis of Siminton s opposition to the contempt motions was his counsel s endeavour to argue that the Sundberg J orders were made without jurisdiction and were therefore a nullity  It was submitted that it follows that Siminton was not obliged to comply with the orders and that therefore there could be no breach of those orders   Although I had some difficulty in following the submission  made on behalf of Siminton the matters alleged by him can be summarised as follows     a  a failure to file a statement of claim as required by O   r  A  of the Federal Court Rules    b  the failure of APRA to make a full and frank disclosure to Sundberg J on the ex parte application   c  APRA s concession to Sundberg J that the evidence did not establish a breach of s   of the Act   d  APRA s claim for damages was an abuse of process   e  there was no proper basis for seeking a Mareva injunction   f  the interim injunction should not have been made  until further order   g  the usual undertaking as to damages was not required   h  Sundberg J did not take into account the potential effect of the order on third parties   i  APRA submission about the threshold for a Mareva injunction was wrong   j  Sundberg J stated in the transcript that he had not read all of the evidence  and    k  APRA s application was an abuse of process   There are two fundamental problems with the submission  The first is that the matters alleged by Siminton to establish absence of jurisdiction to make the Sundberg J orders do not  even if made out  establish absence of jurisdiction  Counsel for Siminton was not able to cite any authority in support of his submission that any of the above matters  if made out  would result in absence of jurisdiction  Plainly  none of the matters relied upon go to the jurisdiction of a judge of the Court to make the Sundberg J orders  I would add that  in any event  the submission was wholly misconceived as I am not satisfied that the allegations relied upon are justified or would warrant any of the Sundberg J orders being set aside  For example  s  A  of the Act provides that APRA  cannot be required  to give an undertaking as to damages  Also  it is clear that APRA s proceeding does not fall within O   r  A   In so far as any of the above matters go to the merits  Siminton s counsel was unable to persuade Gray J on the later inter partes application hearing that Mareva type orders should not be made or that there was any disqualifying conduct of any kind on the part of APRA followedLouis

observed  at   that     The differences upon which the distinction between civil and criminal contempt is based are  in significant respects  illusory  They certainly do not justify the allocation of different standards of proof for civil and criminal contempt  Rather  the illusory nature of those differences and the fact that the usual outcome of successful proceedings is punishment  no matter whether primarily for the vindication of judicial authority or primarily for the purpose of coercing obedience in the interest of the individual  make it clear as Deane J said in Hinch   that all proceedings for contempt  must realistically be seen as criminal in nature   The consequence is that all charges of contempt must be proved beyond reasonable doubt   The evidence adduced by APRA and relied upon by it without objection was set out in the following affidavits  together with the exhibits referred to in those affidavits   a  David John Harley dated   December   and   March    b

would be expected to give evidence  The most that can be said in criminal matters is that there are some cases in which evidence  or an explanation  contradicting an apparently damning inference to be drawn from proven facts could come only from the accused  In the absence of such evidence or explanation  the jury may more readily draw the conclusion which the prosecution seeks  As was said in Weissensteiner v The Queen           I n a criminal trial  hypotheses consistent with innocence may cease to be rational or reasonable in the absence of evidence to support them when that evidence  if it exists at all  must be within the knowledge of the accused    footnotes omitted citedAustralian Industry Group v Automotive  Food  Metals  Engineering  Printing   Kindred Industries Union   Ors

In the present case  Siminton s failure to contradict the  damning  inferences which APRA claims ought to be drawn from the proven facts  leaves no real scope for a rational or reasonable hypothesis consistent with his innocence  In the circumstances  I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that   a  the inferences contended for by APRA ought to be drawn     b  the conclusions contended for by APRA are entirely justified and warranted by the evidence   c  the evidence does not justify or warrant a finding that there is any reasonable or rational hypothesis consistent with Siminton s innocence of the contempt charges appliedCameron v Cole   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  The second fundamental difficulty with Siminton s jurisdiction argument is

made in excess of jurisdiction was explained in Jackson v Sterling Industries Ltd   HCA         CLR   in which the High Court considered  inter alia  the effect of an order which ought not have been made  Wilson J and Dawson J stated  at      In the same way  a court which is given power to determine the facts upon which its jurisdiction depends may  if it proceeds upon a wrongful determination  be said in one sense to exceed its jurisdiction  but its orders will be valid unless and until corrected on appeal  The position is otherwise where it is apparent on the face of a purported exercise of jurisdiction that there is no power or where the court s jurisdiction depends upon matters in dispute which cannot be conclusively determined by the court    footnotes omitted  See also Deane J  at   with whom Mason CJ agreed  at   citedRe Macks  Ex parte Saint   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Even where jurisdiction is lacking as a result of invalidity of the legislation purporting to confer jurisdiction  an order of a superior court will be binding until set aside  In Re Macks  Ex parte Saint   HCA         CLR   the High Court considered the effect of orders for winding up made by the Federal Court pursuant to jurisdiction purportedly conferred by invalid legislation  The High Court concluded that the orders of the court were binding until set aside despite the absence of jurisdiction  Gaudron J stated  at               the Constitution expressly contemplates that federal courts might be empowered to make decisions with respect to their own jurisdiction which are binding until set aside      In establishing the Federal Court as  a superior court of record  the Parliament has  at the very least  validly authorised that Court to make a binding determination on the question whether or not it has jurisdiction in a matter  subject only to the parties  right to appeal or to seek relief pursuant to s  v  of the Constitution   And  if the Federal Court determines that it has jurisdiction  it is obliged  subject only to limited and well recognised exceptions  to exercise that jurisdiction to determine the rights and liabilities in issue  That is the nature of judicial power  The practical consequence of those two considerations is that  by operation of s   of the Constitution   orders of the Federal Court  even if made without jurisdiction  are final and binding unless set aside on appeal or pursuant to s  v  of the Constitution           It follows from what has been said with respect of s   of the Federal Court Act that an order of the Federal Court made without jurisdiction is not a nullity    footnotes omitted  Gummow J and Kirby J took a similar approach  see         and         respectively  McHugh J also agreed that the orders were binding until set aside in so far as they impliedly determined that the Federal Court had jurisdiction  at      Hayne and Callinan JJ expressed reservations about whether orders made by the Federal Court in relation to matters beyond the Commonwealth s legislative competence would be binding  but nonetheless stated  at        The practical consequence   is that orders made by the Federal Court are valid until they are set aside  That is so because implicit in an assertion of jurisdiction is the conclusion about the constitutional validity of that assertion  For the reasons given earlier  the authority to decide and the power to provide that the order is binding until set aside is sufficiently rooted in ss   and    citedParisienne Basket Shoes Pty Ltd v Whyte   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  However  as was observed by Dixon J in Parisienne Basket Shoes Pty Ltd v Whyte   HCA         CLR   at      It cannot be denied that  if the legislature see fit to do it  any event or fact or circumstance whatever may be made a condition upon the occurrence or existence of which the jurisdiction of a court shall depend  But  if the actual legislature does make the jurisdiction of a court contingent upon the actual existence of a state of facts  as distinguished from the court s opinion or determination that the facts do exist  then the validity of the proceedings and order must always remain an outstanding question until some other court or tribunal  possessing power to determine that question  decides that the requisite state of facts in truth existed and the proceedings of the court were valid  Conceding the abstract possibility of the legislature adopting such a course  nevertheless it produces so inconvenient a result that no enactment dealing with proceedings in any of the ordinary courts of justice should receive such an interpretation unless the intention is clearly expressed  citedBray v F Hoffman La Roche Ltd   FCA

a justiciable dispute arising under the Act  which is a law made by the Federal Parliament  The jurisdiction of the Court in respect of that dispute is conferred by s  B A c  of the Judiciary Act    Cth  which confers jurisdiction on the Federal Court in any matter arising under any laws made by the Federal Parliament  It is unnecessary to consider if it also arises under s  B A a   Section  A of the Act and s   of the Federal Court Act    Cth  plainly conferred power to make the Sundberg J orders  In particular  s  A conferred power on the Court to grant  an interim injunction  pending determination of an application for an injunction under s  A   The jurisdiction exercised by Sundberg J was one in which his Honour was given power to determine the facts upon which his jurisdiction was based  It was not a jurisdiction that was preconditioned upon facts or any other matters which his Honour was not given the power to determine  Accordingly  the orders were valid and binding until set aside even if  contrary to my findings  there was an excess or absence of jurisdiction   For the above reasons  the arguments of Siminton as to absence of jurisdiction to make the Sundberg J orders are without substance and are to be rejected   It follows that the charges the subject of the disposal and website allegations have been established beyond reasonable doubt and that the charges the subject of the failure to file allegations are to be dismissed  I propose to give directions for a further hearing in relation to penalty       I certify that the preceding fifty four   numbered
