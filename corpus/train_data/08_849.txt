Court had power generally to order interrogatories to be answered in judicial review proceedings  said that it saw no reason  why there should be a differentiation in Australia between the power to order discovery and the power to order that interrogatories be answered    It should not be thought that I reject absolutely the use of additional evidence on judicial review  While generally the state of mind of the decision maker would be irrelevant in judicial review  there are cases which warrant the reception of such evidence  see  for example  Percerep v Minister for Immigration and

relating to extraneous matters going far beyond the material before the decision maker  Claims of improper purpose typically present evidentiary difficulties  The Court must determine  in cases of that type  whether a stated purpose was in fact the real purpose  Such claims often fail for lack of sufficient evidence  On occasion  however  documents obtained on discovery and answers to interrogatories can provide evidence of motive or purpose and  accordingly  may be of relevance  See  for example  Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Wong at

discrimination without apparent justification has  in some circumstances  been held to constitute Wednesbury unreasonableness  Fares Rural Meat and Livestock Co Pty Ltd v Australian Meat and Live Stock Corporation   FCA         ALR    They say  however  that the Minister s exercise of power under s  EA  is not susceptible to review purely because different Ministers have acted differently in the past in relation to similar imported goods   The respondents also say that the Minister is under no obligation to consider whether to exercise his power under s  EA in relation to all goods that are imported  The power is one that involves ordering Customs to detain goods if the Minister considers that it is in the public interest to do so  There is no requirement under the section that Customs inform the Minister of any particular situations in which he or she may potentially exercise the power  still less any requirement that the Minister initiate investigations into all such cases

satisfying the Court that this criterion is met lies upon the party alleging that to be the case   Any proceeding commenced on or after   December   is subject to s  A  of the Federal Court of Australia Act    Cth  as well as O   r   of the Rules  Section  A provides that the Court may give summary judgment in favour of one party against another if  inter alia  it is satisfied that the other party  has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding or that part of the proceeding   For the purposes of the section  a proceeding  or part of a proceeding  need not be hopeless or bound to fail for it to have no reasonable prospect of success  The section is concerned with the bringing and defending of proceedings  and not just with pleadings  It seems clear that the section is intended to relax the test imposed by General Steel as to the circumstances in which a proceeding may be struck out   The respondents did not at any stage seek to invoke s  A  For that reason  I propose to hold them to the higher  General Steel standard insofar as they seek to strike out the grounds of review that they have identified  I do so without expressing any final opinion as to whether s  A would  in fact  have been available to them had they sought to rely upon it   To the extent that the applicant s case against the respondents depends upon nothing more than its claim that the current Minister is approaching the question of  public interest  in a different manner to his predecessor  it is untenable   The Minister s predecessor may have taken a more benign view of the importation of weapons of this type  If he did  that still cannot form the basis of a conclusion that the Minister s decision in this case was unreasonable  The requirement in s  EA that the Minister base his decision upon  the public interest  confers upon him a broad and multi faceted discretion  Reasonable minds are likely to differ as to what that term entails  If the Minister s decision is  ultimately  held to be unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense  it will be because it was wholly irrational and not because his predecessor did not share this Minister s views   It follows that I would be minded to strike out the grounds of review  and the particulars in support thereof  that depend entirely upon reasoning of the type just discussed  I say that in the context of an interlocutory application brought for the sole purpose of obtaining leave to deliver interrogatories aimed at assembling evidence to support a factual finding that leads nowhere in a legal sense  As I will not be hearing this matter when it comes before the Court for final determination  it is sufficient for me to do no more than refuse the application for leave to deliver those interrogatories that relate to the period prior to   December   without  at this stage  proceeding to strike out the grounds of review that I regard as untenable   The position regarding the period after   December   is more difficult  At a theoretical level  there might be a case in which it could be shown that the Minister has discriminated against the applicant  singling it out for adverse treatment and ignoring the acts of its competitors  Such conduct on the part of the Minister might be amenable to judicial review  if not under the ADJR Act   then certainly pursuant to s  B citedWalton v Gardiner

grounds of review that seem untenable  The section permits judgment to be given in favour of one party against another only  and does not address grounds of review as such  see Fortron Automotive

allegations of fraud or dishonesty  or even seriously improper behaviour  may justify the making of such orders  For a time  there developed a body of case law in this country involving challenges to the validity of search warrants  essentially on the basis that they had been improperly obtained  The principle seems to have been that a warrant obtained by a half truth should be set aside  See generally the authorities collected and discussed by Aronson  Dyer and Groves   Judicial Review of Administrative Action    rd ed    at   fn    In some of these cases  far ranging discovery was ordered and informative documents obtained  Interestingly  however  attempts to deliver interrogatories were generally unsuccessful  see  for example  Grofam Pty Ltd v Macauley     FCR     where leave to serve interrogatories on a magistrate who had issued a search warrant was refused   The only grounds of review that could even conceivably support the grant of leave to deliver interrogatories in this case are those alleging discrimination on the part of this Minister when he decided to have the applicant s weapons detained  based upon his later treatment of its competitors  These are ground  d  in support of the ADJR Act application and ground  e  in support of the s  B A c  application  However  as discussed above  those grounds are largely speculative  They do not warrant the grant of leave to interrogate   It follows that I need not determine whether  as the respondents contend  it would be unduly burdensome for them to be required to answer the proposed interrogatories  The applicant has failed to establish any adequate basis for their delivery  The grounds of review to which they are directed are untenable   I certify that the preceding fifty one   numbered paragraphs
