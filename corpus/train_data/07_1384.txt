Safeway Stores Pty Ltd     FCR   Two aspects may be noted  First  these penalties were increased very substantially  from   in   schedule   Workplace Relations Amendment  Codifying Contempt Offences  Act    Cth   As to the seriousness with which the legislature views such contraventions  this increase  speaks for itself  Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd     FCR   at     Secondly  in s   the current Act prescribes different penalties for different contraventions  There are two levels    or   penalty units  The contraventions presently under consideration attract the higher level   The Group of which the respondent is a member has been in the hotel business in Tasmania since   citedCanturi v Sita Coaches Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth federal ct  html  In a small  intimate workplace like the Hotel  the conduct of the respondent can be taken to have had a significant intimidatory effect on other employees  cf Canturi v Sita Coaches Pty Ltd   FCA         FCR   at     The respondent must have been aware of this advantage for the implementation of its policy   The respondent s submissions in mitigation of penalty centred on its admission of liability and an attempt to distance itself from the conduct of Mr Barry  It was said that Mr Kalis had gone to Greece on holiday and decided that Mr Barry  a person of long experience in the hotel industry  would be left in charge of the Hotel   This proceeding was commenced on   October    It was initially fixed for a four day trial commencing on   August    The respondent had filed a number of affidavits in opposition to those of the applicant  I was told that negotiations for a possible admission commenced in June  The Court was not firmly advised until mid August that a full trial on liability would not be needed citedR v Shannon     SASR   The significance of a plea of guilty is discussed by Professor Kate Warner in her Sentencing in Tasmania   nd ed  The Federation Press    in these terms      Guilty Pleas         A plea of guilty is a mitigating factor but the weight it is given will depend upon the relevant circumstances including remorse  the degree to which psychological trauma to potential witnesses is avoided  the length of the trial and the strength of the prosecution case  Recent Tasmanian decisions have accepted the following propositions advanced by King CJ in Shannon     SASR   at     as a correct statement of the principles governing the mitigatory effect of pleas of guilty        A plea of guilty may be taken into account in mitigation of sentence where    a  it results from genuine remorse  repentance or contrition  or        b  it results from a willingness to co operate in the administration of justice by saving the expense and inconvenience of a trial  or the necessity of witnesses giving evidence  or results from some other consideration which is in the public interest  notwithstanding that the motive  or one of the motives  for such co operation may be a desire to earn leniency        and where to allow the plea a mitigatory effect would be conducive to the public purposes which the sentencing judge is seeking to achieve       A plea of guilty is not of itself a matter of mitigation where it does not result from any of the above motives  but only from a recognition of the inevitable  or is entered as the means of inducing the prosecution not to proceed with a more serious charge       In cases falling within   the judge is not bound to make a reduction  but should consider the plea with all the other relevant factors in arriving at a proper sentence       In assessing the weight to be attached to a plea of guilty as a factor making for leniency  it is proper for the judge to bear in mind that it is important to the administration of justice that guilty persons should not cause expense to the public and delay to other causes by putting forward false stories and on the basis of such false stories contesting the charges against them       The above propositions are not to be taken as weakening in any way the principle that there must be no increase in the sentence which is appropriate to the crime because the offender has contested the charge   It is true that the admission by the respondent has saved a substantial amount of public money  in this jurisdiction under the Act costs would not normally be awarded  s    Also the employees have been saved the stress of having to give evidence about unpleasant events  On the other hand  the admission came at a late stage and after substantial costs had been incurred citedJoel v Morison     Car   P   However  such mitigation as may have been obtained by an admission of liability was somewhat lessened by the submission that the respondent should get a  further discount  because it was giving up a possible defence  It was not  so the argument went   bowing to the inevitable   Mr Barry was  in the time honoured metaphor  engaging in  a frolic of his own   a catchy phrase coined by Parke B in Joel v Morison     Car   P   at   and explained by Diplock LJ in Morris v C W Martin   Sons Ltd     QB   at      If there had been apportionment  it was said  Mr Barry would be   per cent liable  as against   per cent for the respondent citedMorris v C W Martin

some technical or artificial deeming provision  In reality  for those employed at the Hotel  Mr Barry was the respondent  cf Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Ltd v Securities Commission     AC   at      citedNew South Wales v Lepore   HCA         CLR  http www austlii edu au au cases cth HCA  html  Approached on common law principles of vicarious liability  and even assuming that his conduct was unauthorised and it was necessary to find that Mr Barry acted within the course of his employment  his conduct was so connected with what he was authorised to do securing signatures to AWAs and arranging rosters that it was a wrongful way of doing what he was employed to do  New South Wales v Lepore   HCA         CLR   at         Obtaining signatures to the AWAs was not a private benefit for Mr Barry but something from which the respondent itself would profit   It was not only Mr Barry who was aware of and implemented the policy  see     above   At the most  a modest discount for admission of liability may be allowable  I would accept the figure of ten per cent as proposed by counsel for the applicant
